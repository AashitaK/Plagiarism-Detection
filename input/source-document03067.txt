PREFACE

In presenting to the public the life and adventures of Black Hawk, some account of the Sac
and Fox Indians--of Keokuk, their distinguished chief--and of the causes which led to the late
contest between these tribes and the United States, was necessarily involved. The introduction
of these collateral subjects, may possibly impart additional interest to this volume.

In speaking of the policy of the government towards the fragment of Sacs and Foxes, with whom
Black Hawk was associated, it has been necessary to censure some of its acts, and to comment
with freedom upon the official conduct of a few public officers.

The Indians are frequently denounced as faithless, ferocious and untameable. Without going
into the inquiry, how far this charge is founded in truth, the question may be asked, has not
the policy of our government contributed, essentially, to impart to them that character? Have
we not more frequently met them in bad faith, than in a Christian spirit? and sustained our
relations with them, more by the power of the sword than the law of kindness? In the inscrutable
ways of Providence, the Indians are walking in ignorance and moral darkness. It is the solemn
duty, and should be the highest glory of this nation, to bring them out of that condition,
and elevate them in the scale of social and intellectual being. But, how is this duty performed?
We gravely recognize them as an independent people, and treat them as vassals: We make solemn
compacts with them, which we interpret as our interest dictates, but punish them if they follow
the example: We admit their title to the land which they occupy, and at the same time literally
compel them to sell it to us upon our own terms: We send agents and missionaries to reclaim
them from the error of their ways--to bring them from the hunter to the pastoral life; and
yet permit our citizens to debase them by spirituous liquors, and cheat them out of their property:
We make war upon them without any adequate cause--pursue them without mercy--and put them to
death, without regard to age, sex or condition: And, then deliberately proclaim to the world,
that they are savages--cruel and untameable--degraded and faithless.

If the present volume shall, in any degree, contribute to awaken the public mind to a sense
of the wrongs inflicted upon the Indians, and to arouse the Christian statesmen of this land,
to the adoption of a more liberal, upright and benevolent course of policy towards them, something
will have been gained to the cause of humanity and of national honor.

The author takes this opportunity of acknowledging his obligations to James Hall, Esq., for
the valuable assistance received from him, in the preparation of this volume. In collecting
the materials for that magnificent work, on which he is now engaged, "The History of the Indians
of North America," this gentleman has become possessed of much interesting matter, in regard
to the Sacs and Foxes, and especially the chief Keokuk; to all of which he has kindly permitted
the author to have access.

  HISTORY

  OF THE

  SAUKEE AND MUSQUAKEE NATIONS,

  USUALLY CALLED THE

  SAC AND FOX INDIANS.

The word Saukee, or O-sau-kee, now written Sauk or more commonly Sac, is derived from a compound
in the Algonquin or Chippeway language, a-saw-we-kee, which means "yellow earth." Mus-qua-kee,
the name of the Fox Indians, signifies "red earth." These two tribes have long resided together,
and now constitute one people, although there are some internal regulations among them which
tend to preserve a distinctive name and lineage. The chiefs, on ceremonial occasions, claim
to be representatives of independent tribes, but this distinction is nominal. For many years
past the principal chief of the Sacs, has been, in fact, the chief of the Foxes likewise. They
are united in peace and war, speak the same language, claim the same territory, have similar
manners and customs, and possess traditions which represent them as descended from the one
common origin--the great Chippeway nation.

Both tribes originally resided upon the waters of the St. Lawrence. The Foxes removed first
to the west, and established themselves in the region of Green Bay. Upon a river bearing their
name, which empties into the head of this Bay, they suffered a signal defeat by a combined
body of French and Indians, at a place, since known as La Butte de Mort, or the Hill of the
Dead.[1] Subsequently to this battle, they were joined by the Sacs, who having become involved
in a war with the Iroquois or Six Nations, were also driven to the westward. They found their
relatives, the Foxes, upon Green Bay, but so far reduced in numbers, by the attacks of other
tribes, that they were no longer able to sustain themselves as an independent people. The union
between these two tribes, which then took place, and continues to this day, was as much a matter
of necessity as of feeling. The period of their migration from the St. Lawrence to the upper
Lakes cannot be satisfactorily ascertained. La Hontan speaks of a Sac village on Fox river,
as early as 1689; and Father Hennepin, in 1680, mentions the Ontagamies or Fox Indians, as
residents on the bay of Puants, now Green Bay.

From this place, the Sauks and Foxes, crossed over to the eastern bank of the Mississippi,
and combining with other tribes, began to act on the offensive. The period of this irruption
from the north, it is not easy to determine. Major Thomas Forsyth, who resided for near twenty
years among the Sauks and Foxes, in a manuscript account of those tribes, now before us, says:

"More than a century ago, all the country, commencing above Rock river, and running down the
Mississippi to the mouth of the Ohio, up that river to the mouth of the Wabash, thence up that
river to Fort Wayne, thence down the Miami of the Lake some distance, thence north to the St.
Joseph's and Chicago; also the country lying south of the Des Moines, down perhaps, to the
Mississippi, was inhabited by a numerous nation of Indians, who called themselves Linneway,
and were called by others, Minneway, signifying "men." This great nation was divided into several
bands, and inhabited different parts of this extensive region, as follows: The Michigamies,
the country south of the Des Moines; the Cohakias that east of the present village of Cohokia
in Illinois; the Kaskaskias that east of the town of that name; the Tamarois had their village
nearly central between Cahokia and Kaskaskia; the Piankeshaws near Vincennes; the Weas up the
Wabash; the Miamies on the head waters of the Miami of the Lakes, on St. Joseph's river and
at Chicago. The Piankeshaws, Weas and Miamies, must at this time have hunted south towards
and on the Ohio. The Peorias, another band of the same nation, lived and hunted on the Illinois
river: The Mascos or Mascontins, called by the French gens des prairies, lived and hunted on
the great prairies, between the Wabash and Illinois rivers. All these different bands of the
Minneway nation, spoke the language of the present Miamies, and the whole considered themselves
as one and the same people; yet from their local situation, and having no standard to go by,
their language became broken up into different dialects. These Indians, the Minneways, were
attacked by a general confederacy of other nations, such as the Sauks and Foxes, resident at
Green Bay and on the Ouisconsin; the Sioux, whose frontiers extended south to the river des
Moines: the Chippeways, Ottoways, and Potawatimies from the lakes, and also the Cherokees and
Choctaws from the south. The war continued for a great many years and until that great nation
the Minneways were destroyed, except a few Miamies and Weas on the Wabash, and a few who are
scattered among strangers. Of the Kaskaskias, owing to their wars and their fondness for spiritous
liquors, there now (1826) remain but thirty or forty souls;--of the Peorias near St. Genevieve
ten or fifteen; of the Piankeshaws forty or fifty. The Miamies are the most numerous; a few
years ago they consisted of about four hundred souls. There do not exist at the present day
(1826) more than five hundred souls of the once great and powerful Minneway or Illini nation.
These Indians, the Minneways, are said to have been very cruel to their prisoners, not unfrequently
burning them. I have heard of a certain family among the Miamies who were called man-eaters,
as they were accustomed to make a feast of human flesh when a prisoner was killed. For these
enormities, the Sauks and Foxes, when they took any of the Minneways prisoners, gave them up
to their women to be buffeted to death. They speak also of the Mascontins with abhorrence,
on account of their cruelties. The Sauks and Foxes have a historical legend of a severe battle
having been fought opposite the mouth of the Iowa river, about fifty or sixty miles above the
mouth of Rock river. The Sauks and Foxes descended the Mississippi in canoes, and landing at
the place above described, started east, towards the enemy: they had not gone far before they
were attacked by a party of the Mascontins. The battle continued nearly all day; the Sauks
and Foxes, for want of ammunition, finally gave way and fled to their canoes; the Mascontins
pursued them and fought desperately, and left but few of the Sauks and Foxes to carry home
the story of their defeat. Some forty or fifty years ago, the Sauks and Foxes attacked a small
village of Peorias, about a mile below St. Louis and were there defeated. At a place on the
Illinois river, called Little Rock, there were formerly killed by the Chippeways and Ottowas,
a number of men, women and children of the Minneway nation. In 1800 the Kickapoos made a great
slaughter of the Kaskaskia Indians. The Main-Pogue, or Potawatimie juggler, in 1801, killed
a great many of the Piankeshaws on the Wabash."

The land on which St. Louis stands, as well as the surrounding country, was claimed by the
Illini confederacy, which had acquiesced in the intrusion of the whites. This circumstance,
it is supposed, led the northern confederacy to the attempt, which they made in 1779, to destroy
the village of St. Louis, then occupied by the Spaniards. As the Sacs and Foxes were active
participators in this attack, no apology is necessary for introducing the following graphic
account of it, from the pen of Wilson Primm, Esqr. of St. Louis.[2]

"In the mean time numerous bands of the Indians living on the lakes and the Mississippi--the
Ojibeways, Menomonies, Winnebagoes, Sioux, Sacs, &c. together with a large number of Canadians,
amounting in all to upwards of fourteen hundred, had assembled on the eastern shore of the
Mississippi, a little above St. Louis, awaiting the sixth of May, the day fixed for the attack.
The fifth of May was the feast of Corpus Christi, a day highly venerated by the inhabitants,
who were all Catholics. Had the assault taken place then, it would have been fatal to them,
for, after divine service, all the men, women and children had flocked to the prairie to gather
strawberries, which were that season very abundant and fine. The town being left perfectly
unguarded, could have been taken with ease, and the unsuspecting inhabitants, who were roaming
about in search of fruit, have been massacred without resistance. Fortunately, however, a few
only of the enemy had crossed the river and ambushed themselves in the prairie. The villagers,
frequently came so near them, in the course of the day, that the Indians from their places
of concealment, could have reached them with their hands. But they knew not how many of the
whites were still remaining in the town, and in the absence of their co-adjutors, feared to
attack, lest their preconcerted plan might be defeated."

On the sixth, the main body of the Indians crossed, and marched directly towards the fields,
expecting to find the greater part of the villagers there; but in this they were disappointed,
a few only having gone out to view their crops. These perceived the approach of the savage
foe, and immediately commenced a retreat towards the town, the most of them taking the road
that led to the upper gate, nearly through the mass of Indians, and followed by a shower of
bullets. The firing alarmed those who were in town, and the cry "to arms! to arms!" was heard
in every direction. They rushed towards the works and threw open the gates to their brethren.
The Indians advanced slowly but steadily towards the town, and the inhabitants, though almost
deprived of hope, by the vast superiority in number of the assailants, determined to defend
themselves to the last.

"In expectation of an attack, Silvio Francisco Cartabona, a governmental officer, had gone
to St. Genevieve for a company of militia to aid in defending the town, in case of necessity,
and had at the beginning of the month returned with sixty men, who were quartered on the citizens.
As soon as the attack commenced, however, neither Cartabona nor his men could be seen. Either
through fear or treachery, they concealed themselves in a garret, and there remained until
the Indians had retired. The assailed being deprived of a considerable force, by this shameful
defection, were still resolute and determined. About fifteen men were posted at each gate;
the rest were scattered along the line of defence, in the most advantageous manner.

"When within a proper distance, the Indians began an irregular fire, which was answered with
showers of grape shot from the artillery. The firing, for a while, was warm; but the Indians
perceived that all their efforts would be ineffectual on account of the intrenchments, and
deterred by the cannon, to which they were unaccustomed, from making a nearer approach, suffered
their zeal to abate, and deliberately retired. At this stage of affairs, the Lieutenant Governor
made his appearance. The first intimation that he received of what was going on, was by the
discharge of artillery, on the part of the inhabitants. He immediately ordered several pieces
of cannon, which were posted in front of the government house, to be spiked and filled with
sand, and went, or rather was rolled in a wheelbarrow, to the scene of action. In a very peremptory
tone, he commanded the inhabitants to cease firing and return to their houses. Those posted
at the lower gate, did not receive the order, and consequently kept their stations. The commandant
perceived this and ordered a cannon to be fired at them. They had barely time to throw themselves
on the ground, when the volley passed over them, and struck the wall, tearing a great part
of it down. These proceedings, as well as the whole tenor of his conduct, since the first rumor
of an attack, gave rise to suspicions very unfavorable to the Lieutenant Governor. It was bruited
about, that he was the cause of the attack, that he was connected with the British, and that
he had been bribed into a dereliction of duty, which, had not providence averted, would have
doomed them to destruction. Under pretext of proving to them that there was no danger of an
attack, he had a few days before it occurred, sold to the traders, all the ammunition belonging
to the government; and they would have been left perfectly destitute and defenceless, had they
not found, in a private house, eight barrels of powder, belonging to a trader, which they seized
in the name of the King, upon the first alarm. Colonel George Rogers Clark, who was at this
time at Kaskaskia, with a few men under his command, understanding that an attack was meditated
on the town, offered all the assistance in his power, to aid in the defence. This offer was
rejected by the Lieutenant Governor. All these circumstances gave birth to a strong aversion
to the commandant, which evinces itself, at this day, in execrations of his character, whenever
his name is mentioned to those who have known him. Representations of his conduct, together
with a detailed account of the attack, were sent to New Orleans by a special messenger, and
the result was that the Governor General appointed Mr. Francisco Cruzat, to the office of Lieutenant
Governor.

"As soon as it was ascertained that the Indians had retired from the neighborhood, the inhabitants
proceeded to gather the dead, that lay scattered in all parts of the prairie. Seven were at
first found and buried in one grave. Ten or twelve others, in the course of a fortnight, were
discovered in the long grass that bordered the marshes. The acts of the Indians were accompanied
by their characteristic ferocity. Some of their victims were horribly mangled. With the exception
of one individual, the whites who accompanied the Indians, did not take part in the butcheries
that were committed. A young man by the name of Calve, was found dead, his skull split open,
and a tomahawk, on the blade of which was written the word Calve, sticking in his brain. He
was supposed to have fallen by the hand of his uncle. Had those who discovered the Indians
in the prairie, fled to the lower gate, they would have escaped; but the greater part of them
took the road that led to the upper gate, through the very ranks of the enemy, and were thus
exposed to the whole of their fire. About twenty persons, it is computed, met their death in
endeavoring to get within the entrenchments. None of those within were injured, and none of
the Indians were killed, at least none of them were found. Their object was not plunder, for
they did not attempt, in their retreat, to take away with them any of the cattle or the horses
that were in the prairie, and that they might have taken; nor did they attack any of the neighboring
towns, where danger would have been less, and the prospect of success greater. The only object
they had in view was the destruction of St. Louis; and this would seem to favor the idea that
they were instigated by the English, and gives good ground, when connected with other circumstances,
to believe that Leyba was their aider and abettor.  *   *   *   *

"A Mr. Chancellier had gone on the day of attack, to the prairie for strawberries, with his
wife, two daughters and an American, the first that had ever been in the country, in a cart
drawn by two horses. When they perceived the Indians, they immediately fled towards the town
in the cart; Mr. Chancellier being seated before, and the American behind, in order to protect
the women, who were in the middle. In their flight the American was mortally wounded. As he
was falling out, Mr. Chancellier seized him and threw him into the midst of the women, exclaiming,
"they shan't get the scalp of my American." He was at the same time struck by two balls, which
broke his arm in as many places, above the elbow. His wife received a bullet through the middle
of her hand, the elder daughter was shot through the shoulder, immediately above the breast,
and the younger was struck on the forehead, but the ball glanced aside and merely stunned her.
The moment Mr. Chancellier arrived at the gate, his horses dropped dead, pierced with a hundred
wounds, but his family was saved."

Mr. Primm, the writer of this interesting narrative, has probably not been fully informed in
regard to the extent of Colonel George Rogers Clark's participation in this affair. In a written
memorandum now before us, made on the authority of his brother, General William Clark of St.
Louis, who it is presumed has possession of his father's official papers, it is stated, in
reference to this affair, that although the Spanish Governor could not be made to believe that
an attack was intended, the principal inhabitants sent over an express to Colonel Clark, who
was then at Kaskaskia with five hundred men, to come and protect them. He accordingly marched
his force up opposite the town and encamped a little distance from the river. He did not send
over any troops, but was to do so, in case of an attack; when it was actually made Colonel
Clark crossed the river; and upon seeing the "long knives," as the Indians called his troops,
they hastily retreated, having killed seventy-two or seventy-three of the Spaniards, before
his arrival. This sudden appearance of Colonel Clark, upon the scene of action, explains the
conduct of the Indians. So large a body of warriors, making a preconcerted attack, upon a town
but badly protected, would not, it is thought, have given up the assault so suddenly and before
they had lost a single man, unless alarmed by the presence of a superior force. On the supposition
that Colonel Clark actually crossed the river with his troops, the flight of the Indians is
easily explained. They were probably apprised of Colonel Clark's being at Kaskaskia, and his
name was every where a terror to the Indians. As an evidence of this, a short time afterwards,
he sent a detachment of one hundred and fifty men, as far up the country as Prairie des Chiens,
and from thence across Rock and Illinois rivers and down to Kaskaskia, meeting with no molestation
from the Indians, who were struck with terror at the boldness of the enterprise, saying that
if so few dared to come, they "would fight like devils."

General William H. Harrison, long familiar with the North West Indians, in an official letter
to the secretary at War, dated H.Q. Cincinnati, March 22d, 1814, giving an able view of the
Indian tribes, makes the following remarks on the descent of this northern confederacy, upon
the great Illini nation.

These historical facts are interesting, as showing the manner in which the Sauks and Foxes
obtained possession of the fertile plains of Illinois; and, as adding another to the many instances
on record, in which hordes of northern invaders have overrun and subjugated the people of more
southern regions. The causes are obvious for this descent of the Sauks and Foxes, upon their
southern neighbors. They reached a more genial climate, a country where game was more abundant
than in the region they left behind, and in which they could, with greater facility, raise
their corn, beans and pumpkins. Other causes than these might have had their influence. The
Illini confederacy may have provoked the descent of the northern tribes upon them. On this
point, Lieutenant Pike in his travels to the sources of the Mississippi, has the following remark.

"By killing the celebrated Sauk chief, Pontiac, the Illinois, Cahokias, Kaskaskias and Peorias,
kindled a war with the allied nations of the Sauks and Reynards, which has been the cause of
the almost entire destruction of the former nations."

The death of Pontiac may have been the immediate exciting cause of the war, but it is more
than probable that the love of conquest and the hope of obtaining a more fruitful and genial
country, than is to be found upon the shore of the lakes, were the principal reasons which
impelled the northern confederacy to the subjugation of the Illini.

The principal village of the Sacs and Foxes, for a long period of time, was on the north side
of Rock river, near its junction with the Mississippi. It contained at one time upwards of
sixty lodges, and was among the largest and most populous Indian villages on the continent.
The country around it is fertile and picturesque, finely watered, and studded with groves and
prairies. It is described in the following graphic manner, by a gentleman[3] who travelled
over it in 1829.

"The Mississippi, which below its junction with the Missouri, is a troubled stream, meandering
through low grounds, and margined by muddy banks, is here a clear and rapid river, flowing
over beds of rock and gravel, and bordered by the most lovely shores. Nothing of the kind can
be more attractive, than the scenery at the upper rapids. On the western shore, a series of
slopes are seen, commencing at the gravelly margin of the water, and rising one above another,
with a barely perceptible acclivity, for a considerable distance, until the back ground is
terminated by a chain of beautifully rounded hills, over which trees are thinly scattered,
as if planted to embellish the scene. This is the singular charm of prairie scenery. Although
it is a wilderness, just as nature made it, the verdant carpet, the gracefully waving outline
of the surface, the clumps and groves and scattered trees, give it the appearance of a noble
park, boundless in extent, and adorned with exquisite taste. It is a wild but not a savage
wild, that awes by its gloom. It is a gay and cheerful wilderness, winning by its social aspect
as well as its variety and intrinsic gracefulness. The eastern shore is not less beautiful:
a broad flat plain of rich alluvion, extending from the water's edge, is terminated by a range
of wooded hills. A small collection of the lodges of the Saukies and Foxes stood on this plain
when the writer last saw it, but their chief village was about three miles distant. In the
front of the landscape, and presenting its most prominent feature, is Rock Island, on the southern
point of which, elevated upon a parapet of rock, is Fort Armstrong. The region around is healthy
and amazingly fruitful. The grape, the plum, the gooseberry and various other native fruits
abound,--the wild honeysuckle gives its perfume to the air, and a thousand indigenous flowers
mingle their diversified hues with the verdure of the plain. But all this fertility of soil
and scenic beauty has produced no ameliorating effect upon the savages. The Sauks of Illinois,
when first visited by the French missionaries were as they are now. They are still savages,
as much so as the Osages, Comanches and Seminoles, and not superior to the wandering Chippeways."

The civil polity of these two tribes bears much resemblance to that of the north western Indians
generally. The peace chiefs are partly elective and partly hereditary. The son succeeds the
father by the assent of the tribe, if worthy of the office, and if not, a successor, of a more
meritorious character, is chosen by them from some collateral branch of the family. There is
a legend among them relating to the relative rank of their chiefs, which, although perhaps
purely figurative, may not be uninteresting to the reader. They say that a great while ago,
their fathers had a long lodge, in the centre of which were ranged four fires. By the first
fire stood two chiefs, one on the right, who was called the great Bear, and one on the left,
called the little Bear: these were the village or peace chiefs: they were the rulers of the
band, and held the authority corresponding to that of the chief magistrate. At the second fire
stood two chiefs: one on the right, called the great Fox, and one on the left, called the little
Fox: these were the war chiefs or generals. At the third fire stood two warriors, who were
called respectively the Wolf and the Owl. And at the other fire, two others who were the Eagle
and the Tortoise. These four last named were not chiefs but braves of distinction, who held
honorable places in the council, and were persons of influence in peace and in war. This lodge
of four fires may have existed among these tribes. It is true that their chiefs remain as described
in the legend.

The peace chief or head-man presides in council, and all important public acts are done in
his name; but unless he be a man of popular talents and great energy of character his place
confers more of honor than power. If a weak or irresolute man, although he nominally retain
his authority, the war chiefs actually exercise it. It is very seldom that he acquires property,
for he is expected to make feasts and presents, and is compelled to be hospitable and liberal
as a means of sustaining his power among his people.

The office of war chief is never hereditary, but results from skill and intrepidity in battle,
and is held so long as those qualities are successfully retained. It may readily be conceived
that among such a race the war chiefs, having the braves and young men of the nation under
their command, would generally maintain a controlling influence. The leading war chief is always
better known than the principal peace chief, is often confounded with him, and still oftener
exercises his authority.

The Sauks are, at the present time, divided into twelve families, and the Foxes into eight,
each known by the name of some animal. Among the Sauks there is another division peculiar to
it. The males are all classed in two parties or bands--one called Kish-ko-guis, or long hairs;
the other Osh-cushis or braves, the former being considered something more than brave. In 1819
each party numbered about four hundred members, and in 1826, the number was increased to five
hundred in each. The standard of the Kish-ko-guis or long hairs, is red, and that of the Osh-cushis
or braves, blue. Every male child, soon after its birth, is marked with white or black paint,
and is classed in one of these two parties, the mother being careful to apply the two colors
alternately, so that if the number of males in a family be even, each band will receive an
equal number of members, and the whole nation will thus be nearly equally divided into the
two colors of black and white. These distinctive marks are permanently retained through life,
and in painting themselves for any ceremonies or public occasions, those of one party use white,
the others black paint, in addition to other colors which may suit their fancy. The reason
of this singular custom is for the purpose of creating and keeping alive a spirit of emulation
in the tribe. In their games, sham-battles and other pastimes, the whites and blacks are opposed
to each other; and in war, each party is ambitious of bringing home a greater number of scalps
than the other.

The chiefs have the management of public affairs, but as we have already seen are more or less
influenced, especially in matters of war or peace, by the braves. In their councils, questions
are not considered, generally, as decided, unless there be unanimity of opinion. Their laws
are few and simple. Debts are but seldom contracted by them, and there is no mode of enforcing
their collection. For redress of civil injuries, an appeal is usually made to some of the old
men of the tribe, mutually selected by the parties concerned; and their decision is considered
as binding. A murder among them is seldom punished capitally. The relatives of the deceased
may take revenge in that way, but it is much more common to receive compensation in property.
If the relatives cannot agree upon the amount of the compensation, the old men of the tribe
interfere and settle it. The kinsfolk of the deceased say, that by killing the murderer, it
will not bring the dead to life, and that it is better to take the customary presents, which
often amount in value to a considerable sum. Occasionally the murderer arranges the whole matter,
by marrying the widow of the man he has killed. There is but one offence that is considered
of a national character, and that is of rare occurrence. It consists in aiding the enemies
of the tribe, in times of war, and is punishable with death. A sentinel who has been placed
on duty by a chief, but who neglects it, is publicly whipped by the women. The Sauks and Foxes
have no established mode of declaring war. If injured by a neighboring tribe they wait a reasonable
time for reparation to be made, and if it is not, they avail themselves of the first fitting
opportunity of taking revenge. The young Indians manifest, at an early age, a love of war.
They hear the old warriors recounting their exploits, and as the battle-field is the only road
to distinction, they embrace the first chance of killing an enemy. When the question of going
to war is under consideration, some one or a number of them, undertake to consult the Great
Spirit by fasting and dreams. These latter are related by them in public, and often have their
influence, being generally so interpreted as to inspire confidence in those who may join the
war party. If a party is victorious in battle, the individual who killed the first enemy, leads
them back, and on the way, if they have prisoners with them, it is not uncommon to kill those
who are old. The young ones are generally adopted into the families of such as have lost relatives
in the battle, or whose children have died a natural death. Upon the return of the victorious
party to their village, a war dance is held round their captives by way of celebrating their
triumph. Prisoners are sometimes held as slaves, and as such are bought and sold. If they go
to war, which they are encouraged to do, and succeed in killing one of the enemy, the slave
changes his name and from that time becomes a freeman. The Sauks and Foxes treat their prisoners
with humanity, and if they succeed in getting to the village alive, they are safe, and their
persons are held sacred. But one instance is known of their having burned a prisoner, and that
was in a war with the Menominies, and in retaliation for a similar act, first committed by
that tribe. The young Indians go to war generally between the age of seventeen and twenty,
but sometimes as early as fifteen. Many of them at the age of forty and forty-five, look old
and are broken down in their physical constitution, in consequence of the hardships which they
have endured in war and the chase. In old age they are usually provided for, and live in peace
at their villages. When one of them is sick, and thinks he is about to go to the land of spirits,
he not unfrequently directs the manner in which he wishes to be buried, and his instructions
are complied with. The Sauks and Foxes bury their dead in the ground, and have preferences
for particular places of interment. The graves are not dug to any great depth, and a little
bark from a tree is made to answer the purpose of a coffin. The body is usually carried to
the grave by old women, who howl at intervals, during the ceremony, most piteously. Before
closing the grave, one of the Indians present at the funeral will wave a stick or war-club,
called "puc-ca waw-gun," saying in an audible voice, "I have killed many men in war, and I
give their spirits to my dead friend who lies here, to serve him as slaves in the other world:"
after which the grave is filled up with earth, and in a day or two a rude cabin or shed is
made over it of rough boards or bark. If the deceased was a brave, a post is planted at the
head of the grave, on which, in a rude manner, the number of scalps and prisoners he has taken
in war, is represented by red paint. Upon the death of an adult, his property is usually distributed
among his relatives, and his widow returns to her own family or nearest kinfolks. The widow
is the principal mourner for the deceased and her grief seems to be sincere. Her countenance
becomes dejected--she seldom smiles--clothes herself in rags, and with disheveled hair and
spots of black paint on her cheeks, wanders about in a pensive mood, seldom shedding tears,
except when alone in the woods. They generally cease mourning at the suggestion of some friend,
wash, paint themselves red and put on their best clothes and ornaments. Some of the Sauks and
Foxes entertain the opinion that the spirit of the deceased hovers about the village or lodge,
for a few days, and then takes its flight to the land of repose. On its way, they suppose it
passes over an extensive prairie, beyond which the woods appear like a blue cloud. Between
this woodland and the prairie, there is a deep and rapid stream of water, across which there
is a pole, kept in continual motion by the force of the current. This stream, the spirit must
cross on the pole, and if it has belonged to a good person, it will get over safe and find
all its good relations that have gone before it. In this woodland, game of all kinds is abundant,
and there the spirits of the good live in everlasting happiness. If on the contrary, the spirit
has belonged to a bad or wicked person in this world, it will fall off the pole into the stream,
and the current will sweep it down to the land of evil spirits, where it will forever remain
in poverty and misery. There is nothing very peculiar in the religious opinions of the Sauks
and Foxes, to distinguish them from the aborigines of this country, generally. They believe
in one Great and Good Spirit, who controls and governs all things, and in supernatural agents
who are permitted to interfere in their concerns. They are of opinion that there is also a
bad spirit, subordinate, however, to the great Manito, who is permitted to annoy and perplex
the Indians, by means of bad medicines, by poisonous reptiles, and by killing their horses
and sinking their canoes. All their misfortunes are attributed to the influence of this bad
spirit, but they have some vague idea that it is in part permitted as a punishment for their
bad deeds. They all believe in ghosts, and when they fancy that they have seen one, the friends
of the deceased give a feast and hang up some clothing as an offering to appease the troubled
spirit. So far as the ceremonials are concerned, the Sauks and Foxes may be called a religious
people. They rarely pass any extraordinary cave, rock, hill or other object, with out leaving
behind them some tobacco for the use of the spirit who they suppose lives there. They have
some kind of prayers, consisting of words which they sing over in the evening and at sunrise
in the morning.

Their tradition in regard to the creation of the world, the deluge and the re-peopling of the
earth, is a singular mixture of truth and fiction. If anterior in its origin, to the arrival
of the whites on this continent, it presents matter of curious speculation. The following account
of it, entitled the Cosmogony of the Saukee and Musquakee Indians, is taken from Doctor Galland's
Chronicles of the North American Savages.

"In the beginning the Gods created every living being which was intended to have life upon
the face of the whole earth; and then were formed every species of living animal. After this
the gods also formed man, whom they perceived to be both cruel and foolish: they then put into
man the heart of the best beast they had created; but they beheld that man still continued
cruel and foolish. After this it came to pass that the Almighty took a piece of himself, of
which he made a heart for the man; and when the man received it, he immediately became wise
above every other animal on the earth.

"And it came to pass in the process of much time, that the earth produced its first fruits
in abundance, and all the living beasts were greatly multiplied. The earth about this time,
was also inhabited by an innumerable host of I-am-woi (giants) and gods. And the gods whose
habitation is under the seas, made war upon We-suk-kah, (the chief god upon the earth) and
leagued themselves with the I-am-woi upon the earth, against him. Nevertheless, they were still
afraid of We-suk-kah and his immense host of gods; therefore they called a council upon the
earth; and when they were assembled upon the earth, at the council, both the I-am-woi and the
gods from under the seas, after much debate, and long consultation, they resolved to make a
great feast upon the earth, and to invite We-suk-kah, that they might thus beguile him, and
at the feast lay hands upon him and slay him.

"And when the council had appointed a delegate to visit We-suk-kah, and commanded him to invite
We-suk-kah to the great feast, which they were preparing upon the earth for him; behold, the
younger brother of We-suk-kah, was in the midst of the council, and being confused in the whole
assembly, they said unto him, "Where is thy brother We-suk-kah." And he answering said unto
them "I know not; am I my brother's keeper?" And the council perceiving that all their devices
were known unto him, they were sorely vexed; therefore, with one accord, the whole assembly
rushed violently upon him and slew him: and thus was slain the younger brother of We-suk-kah.

"Now when We-suk-kah had heard of the death of his younger brother, he was extremely sorrowful
and wept aloud; and the gods whose habitations are above the clouds, heard the voice of his
lamentations, and they leagued with him to avenge the blood of his brother. At this time the
lower gods had fled from the face of the earth, to their own habitations under the seas; and
the I-am-woi were thus forsaken, and left alone to defend themselves against We-suk-kah and
his allies.

"Now the scene of battle, where We-suk-kah and his allies fought the I-am-woi, was in a flame
of fire; and the whole race of the I-am-woi were destroyed with a great slaughter, that there
was not one left upon the face of the whole earth. And when the gods under the sea, knew the
dreadful fate of their allies, the I-am-woi, whom they had deserted, they were sore afraid
and they cried aloud to Na-nam-a-keh (god of thunder) to come to their assistance. And Na-nam-a-keh
heard their cry and accepted their request, and sent his subaltern, No-tah-tes-se-ah, (god
of the wind) to Pa-poan-a-tesse-ah, (god of the cold) to invite him to come with all his dreadful
host of frost, snow, hail, ice and north-wind, to their relief. When this destroying army came
from the north, they smote the whole earth with frost, converting the waters of every river,
lake, and sea into solid masses of ice, and covering the whole earth with an immense sheet
of snow and hail. Thus perished all the first inhabitants of the earth both men, beasts and
gods, except a few choice ones of each kind, which We-suk-kah preserved with himself upon the
earth.

"And again it came to pass in the process of a long time, that the gods under the sea came
forth again, upon the earth; and when they saw We-suk-kah, that he was almost alone on the
earth, they rejoiced in assurance of being able to destroy him. But when they had exhausted
every scheme, attempted every plan, and executed every effort to no effect, perceiving that
all their councils and designs were well known to We-suk-kah as soon as they were formed, they
became mad with despair, and resolved to destroy We-suk-kah, by spoiling forever the whole
face of the earth, which they so much desired to inhabit. To this end, therefore, they retired
to their former habitations under the sea and intreated Na-nam-a-keh (the god of thunder) to
drown the whole earth with a flood.

"And Na-nam-a-keh again hearkened to their cries, and calling all the clouds to gather themselves
together, they obeyed his voice and came; and when all the clouds were assembled, he commanded
them and they poured down water upon the earth, a tremendous torrent, until the whole surface
of the earth, even the tops of the highest mountains were covered with water. But it came to
pass, when We-suk-kah saw the water coming upon the earth, he took some air, and made an o-pes-quie,
(vessel, boat or shell) and getting into it himself, he took with him all sorts of living beasts,
and man; and when the waters rose upon the earth the o-pes-quie was lifted up and floated upon
the surface, until the tops of the highest mountains were covered with the flood. And when
the o-pes-quie had remained for a long time upon the surface of the flood, We-suk-kah called
one of the animals, which was with him in the o-pes-quie, and commanded it to go down through
the water to the earth, to bring from thence some earth; and after many repeated efforts and
with great difficulty, the animal at length returned, bringing in its mouth, some earth; of
which, when We-suk-kah had received it, he formed this earth, and spread it forth upon the
surface of the water; and went forth himself and all that were with him in the o-pes-quie,
and occupied the dry land."

In the social or family relations of the Sauks and Foxes, it is considered the duty of the
men to hunt and clothe their wives and children--to purchase arms and the implements of husbandry
so far as they use them--to make canoes and assist in rowing them--to hunt and drive their
horses, make saddles, &c. &c. The duties of the women, are to skin the game when brought home
and prepare the skins for market, to cook, to make the camp, cut and carry wood, make moccasins,
plant and gather the corn, beans and pumpkins, and do all the drudgery connected with the domestic
affairs. It is the commonly received opinion among the whites that the female Indians are the
slaves of their husbands. This is not literally true. The men seldom make their wives feel
their authority: as a general rule among the Sauks and Foxes, they live happily together. The
wives take the liberty of scolding their husbands, very frequently, and it is considered by
both parties that every thing in the family, except the war and hunting implements, belongs
to the wife, and she may do with it as she pleases. The men may each have two or three, or
even more wives. They generally prefer to take sisters, as they agree better together in the
same lodge: the eldest usually regulates all the domestic affairs of the family and has charge
of the property belonging to it. The men turn off their wives and the latter leave their husbands
whenever they become discontented. While living together, the women are generally faithful
to their husbands. The daughters seldom leave their mothers until they are married, which usually
occurs when they are about fourteen or fifteen years of age. The parents of an Indian girl
are generally conciliated by presents from her lover, but they may insist upon servitude from
him, which sometimes runs throughout one, two or three years. There is no particular marriage
ceremony among them, beyond that of the contract between the parents or parties. A young Sauk
lover is represented as a silly looking fellow, who can neither eat, drink or sleep--he appears
to be deranged, and with all the pains he takes to conceal his passion, his malady is still
apparent to his friends. The faithfulness of this sketch, will hardly be questioned, when the
close analogy which it bears to a pale-faced lover, is recalled to mind. The Sauks and Foxes,
when pinched with hunger, will eat almost any kind of meat, but prefer venison and bear's meat
to all other; they never eat it unless cooked. They make much use of corn, beans and pumpkins,
and annually raise considerable quantities. They are not fond of fish and seldom eat them if
they can procure other kinds of food.

There are but three kinds of musical instruments used among these tribes. The drum, which is
beat at their feasts, dances and games, the tambourin, and a kind of flageolet, made of cane
or two pieces of soft wood hollowed out and fastened together with strips of leather. Their
tunes are always on a flat key, have but few variations and are mostly of a melancholy character.
According to Mr. Atwater, who visited those residing near Rock Island, in 1829, the Sacs and
Foxes have "tunes evidently of French origin, and some songs of considerable length." "These
Indians have among them, what answers to the Italian Improvisatori who make songs for particular
occasions." The same writer says, "the Sauks and Foxes have a considerable number of songs,
suited to a great many occasions in their own language." He further adds, "Among the Indians
of the Upper Mississippi, the Sauks and Foxes are decidedly the best actors, and have the greatest
variety of plays among them." In common with the Indian tribes generally, they have a variety
of athletic games, in which both the men and women join. They are addicted to cards and other
games of chance, and often bet very high.

Touching the condition of these tribes in 1805, Lieutenant Pike, in his travels to the sources
of the Mississippi, says, "The first nation of Indians whom we met with, were the Sauks, who
principally reside in four villages. The first at the head of the rapids des Moyens, on the
west shore, containing thirteen lodges. The second on a prairie on the east shore about sixty
miles above. The third on the river De Roche [Rock river] about three miles from the entrance,
and the last on the river Iowa. They hunt on the Mississippi and its confluent streams from
the Illinois to the river Des Iowa; and on the plains west of them which border the Mississippi.
They are so perfectly consolidated with the Reynards (the Foxes) that they can scarcely be
termed a distinct nation; but recently there appears to be a schism between the two nations:
the latter not approving of the insolence and ill-will, which has marked the conduct of the
former towards the United States, on many late occurrences. They have for many years past made
war (under the auspices of the Sioux) on the Santeaux, Osages and Missouries; but as recently
a peace has been (through the influence of the United States) made between them and the nations
of the Missouri, and by the same means between the Sioux and the Santeaux (their principal
allies) it appears it would be by no means a difficult matter to induce them to make a general
peace, and pay still greater attention to the cultivation of the earth: as they now raise a
considerable quantity of corn, beans and melons. The character which they bear with their savage
brethren, is, that they are much more to be dreaded for their deceit and inclination for stratagem,
than for open courage.

"The Reynards reside in three villages. The first on the west side of the Mississippi six miles
above the rapids of the river de Roche. The second about twelve miles in the rear of the lead
mines, and the third on Turkey river, half a league from its entrance. They are engaged in
the same wars, and have the same alliances as the Sauks, with whom they must be considered
as indissoluble in war and peace. They hunt on both sides of the Mississippi, from the river
Iowa (below the prairie des Chiens) to a river of that name, above said village. They raise
a great quantity of corn, beans and melons; the former of those articles in such quantities,
as to sell many hundred bushels per annum."

At this period, 1805, according to Lieutenant Pike, the total number of souls in the Sauk nation
was 2850, of whom 1400 were children, seven hundred and fifty women, and seven hundred warriors.
They resided in their villages and had about seven hundred stand of arms. Their trade was principally
in deer skins, with some bear and a few otter, beaver and raccoon skins. The total number of
the Foxes was 1750, of whom eight hundred and fifty were children, five hundred women and four
hundred warriors, with about four hundred stand of arms. Their number of villages and their
trade being the same with the Sauks.

Some further items of information about these tribes may be gleaned from the statistical view
of the Indian nations furnished by Lewis and Clark's Expedition. It is there stated that the
Saukee, or O-sau-kee, speak a primitive language, dwell principally in two villages, have about
five hundred warriors and 2000 souls in the tribe, were at war with the Osage, Chippeway and
Sioux. The Foxes or Ot-tar-gar-me, in the Saukee language, number not more than 1200 souls,
and about three hundred warriors. These nations, the Sauks and Foxes, says Mr. Lewis, are so
perfectly consolidated that they may in fact be considered as one nation only: "they are extremely
friendly to the whites and seldom injure their traders; but they are the most implacable enemies
to the Indian nations with whom they are at war; to them is justly attributed the almost entire
destruction of the Missouries, the Illinois, the Cahokias, Kaskaskias, and Peorias."

In 1825, the Secretary at War, estimated the entire number of Sacs and Foxes at 4,600 souls,
and in 1826, the warriors were supposed to amount to between twelve and fourteen hundred. Supposing
these estimates to approximate the truth, it appears that during the twenty years between 1805
and 1825, these tribes had increased very considerably in numbers.

The traders generally and those who have had most intercourse with the Sauks and Foxes, speak
of them as honest in their dealings, and feel safe among them, seldom locking their doors by
day or night, and allowing them free ingress to their stores and houses. Their reputation for
courage, it appears, does not stand quite so fair. Lieutenant Pike speaks of them as being
more dreaded by their savage brethren for "their deceit and inclination for stratagem, than
for their open courage." Major Thomas Forsyth, late U.S. agent among the Sacs and Foxes, calls
them a dastardly and cowardly set of Indians. The correctness of these charges may be questioned.
Mr. Schoolcraft, in speaking of the Foxes says, "the history of their migrations and wars,
shows them to have been a restless and spirited people, erratic in their dispositions, having
a great contempt for agriculture, and a predominant passion for war." He adds, "they still
retain their ancient character, and are constantly embroiled in wars and disputes with their
neighbors, the results of which show, that they have more courage in battle, than wisdom in
council." In a report of the war department to the President, made by the secretary Mr. Cass,
in 1832, the Sacs and Foxes are spoken of as being distinguished for their "daring spirit of
adventure and for their natural courage."

The truth appears to be, that the Sacs and Foxes fought their way from the waters of the St.
Lawrence to Green Bay, and after reaching that place, not only sustained themselves against
hostile tribes, but were among the most active and courageous in the subjugation or rather
extermination of the numerous and powerful Illini confederacy. They have had many wars, offensive
and defensive, with the Sioux, the Pawnees, the Osages and other tribes, some of whom are ranked
among the most fierce and ferocious warriors on the continent; and, it does not appear, that
in these conflicts, running through a long period of years, they were found wanting in this
greatest of savage virtues. In the late war with Great Britain, a party from the Sacs and Foxes,
fought under the British standard as a matter of choice: and in the recent contest between
a fragment of these tribes and the United States, although defeated and literally cut to pieces
by an overwhelming force, it is very questionable whether their reputation as braves, would
suffer by a comparison with that of their victors. It is believed that a careful review of
their history, from the period when they first established themselves on the waters of the
Mississippi, down to the present time, will lead the inquirer to the conclusion, that the Sacs
and Foxes are truly a courageous people, shrewd, politic, and enterprising, with not more of
ferocity and treachery of character, than is common among the tribes by whom they are surrounded.

The first treaty between the United States and the Sacs, was made at Fort Harmar, on the Muskingum
river, on the 9th of January 1789. The object of this treaty seems to have been the confirmation
of former treaties and the adjustment of boundary lines of previous cessions of land. By the
fourteenth article of this treaty, it is provided, that the United States, "do also receive
into their friendship and protection, the nations of the Pottawatamies, and Sacs; and do hereby
establish a league of peace and amity between them respectively; and all the articles of this
treaty, so far as they apply to these nations, are to be considered as made and concluded,
in all and every part, expressly with them and each of them."

On the 27th of June 1804, the President, Mr. Jefferson, directed Governor William H. Harrison,
to make a treaty with the Sacs, and obtain, if possible, cessions of land on both sides of
the Illinois river, and to give them, in lieu thereof, an annual compensation. In November
following, Governor Harrison concluded a treaty with the Sacs and Foxes, under his instructions.
As this treaty has formed the basis of all the subsequent ones made with these tribes, and
as its validity, has been disputed by some of the Sac nation, it is deemed expedient, to copy
it entire, in this place, more especially as it will be matter of frequent reference in the
subsequent pages of this work.

"Articles of a treaty, made at Saint Louis, in the district of Louisiana, between William Henry
Harrison, governor of the Indiana Territory and of the district of Louisiana, superintendent
of Indian affairs for the said territory and district, and commissioner plenipotentiary of
the United States, for concluding any treaty, or treaties which may be found necessary with
any of the north western tribes of Indians, of the one part; and the chiefs and head men of
the united Sac and Fox tribes of the other part."

Article 1. The United States receive the united Sac and Fox tribes into their friendship and
protection; and the said tribes agree to consider themselves under the protection of the United
States, and of no other power whatsoever.

Art. 2. The general boundary line between the lands of the United States and of the said Indian
tribes shall be as follows, viz: Beginning at a point on the Missouri river, opposite to the
mouth of the Gasconade river; thence, in a direct course so as to strike the river Jeffreon,
at the distance of thirty miles from its mouth, and down the said Jeffreon to the Mississippi;
thence, up the Mississippi to the mouth of the Ouisconsin river, and up the same to a point
which shall be thirty-six miles, in a direct line from the mouth of said river; thence, by
a direct line to a point where the Fox river (a branch of the Illinois) leaves the small lake
called Sakaegan; thence down the Fox river to the Illinois river, and down the same to the
Mississippi. And the said tribes, for and in consideration of the friendship and protection
of the United States, which is now extended to them, of the goods (to the value of two thousand,
two hundred and thirty-four dollars and fifty cents) which are now delivered, and of the annuity
hereinafter stipulated to be paid, do hereby cede and relinquish forever, to the United States,
all the lands included within the above described boundary.

Art. 3. In consideration of the cession and relinquishment of land made in the preceding article,
the United States will deliver to the said tribes, at the town of St. Louis, or some other
convenient place on the Mississippi, yearly and every year, goods suited to the circumstances
of the Indians, of the value of one thousand dollars (six hundred of which are intended for
the Sacs, and four hundred for the Foxes,) reckoning that value at the first cost of the goods
in the city or place in the United States, where they shall be procured. And if the said tribes
shall hereafter, at an annual delivery of the goods aforesaid, desire that a part of their
annuity should be furnished in domestic animals, implements of husbandry, and other utensils,
convenient for them, the same shall at the subsequent annual delivery, be furnished accordingly.

Art. 4. The United States will never interrupt the said tribes, in the possession of the lands
which they rightfully claim; but will on the contrary, protect them in the quiet enjoyment
of the same, against their own citizens, and against all other white persons, who may intrude
upon them. And the said tribes do hereby engage, that they will never sell their land, or any
part thereof, to any sovereign power but the United States; nor to the citizens or subjects
of any other sovereign power, nor to the citizens of the United States.

Art. 5. Lest the friendship which is now established between the United States and the said
Indian tribes, should be interrupted by the misconduct of individuals, it is hereby agreed,
that for injuries done by individuals, no private revenge or retaliation shall take place;
but, instead thereof, complaint shall be made by the party injured to the other; by the said
tribes, or either of them, to the superintendent of Indian affairs, or one of his deputies;
and by the superintendent, or other person appointed by the President, to the chiefs of the
said tribes. And it shall be the duty of the said chiefs, upon complaint being made, as aforesaid,
to deliver up the person, or persons, against whom the complaint is made, to the end that he,
or they, may be punished agreeably to the laws of the state or territory where the offence
may have been committed. And, in like manner, if any robbery, violence or murder shall be committed
on any Indian, or Indians, belonging to the said tribes, or either of them, the person or persons
so offending, shall be tried, and if found guilty, punished, in like manner as if the injury
had been done to a white man. And it is further agreed, that the chiefs of the said tribes
shall, to the utmost of their power, exert themselves to recover horses, or other property
which may be stolen from any citizen or citizens of the United States by any individual or
individuals of their tribes. And the property so recovered, shall be forthwith delivered to
the superintendent, or other person authorized to receive it, that it may be restored to the
proper owner. And in cases where the exertions of the chiefs shall be ineffectual in recovering
the property stolen, as aforesaid, if sufficient proof can be obtained, that such property
was actually stolen by any Indian, or Indians, belonging to the said tribes or either of them,
the United States may deduct from the annuity of the said tribes, a sum equal to the value
of the property which was stolen. And the United States hereby guaranty to any Indian or Indians,
of the said tribes, a full indemnification for any horses, or other property, which may be
stolen from them, by any of their citizens: Provided, that the property so stolen cannot be
recovered, and that sufficient proof is produced that it was actually stolen by a citizen of
the United States.

Art. 6. If any citizen of the United States, or any other white person, should form a settlement,
upon the lands which are the property of the Sac and Fox tribes, upon complaint being made
thereof, to the Superintendent, or other person having charge of the affairs of the Indians,
such intruder shall forthwith be removed.

Art. 7. As long as the lands which are now ceded to the United States remain their property,
the Indians belonging to the said tribes shall enjoy the privilege of living and hunting upon them.

Art. 8. As the laws of the United States regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes,
are already extended to the country inhabited by the Sacs and Foxes, and as it is provided
by those laws, that no person shall reside, as a trader, in the Indian country, without a licence
under the hand and seal of the Superintendent of Indian affairs, or other person appointed
for the purpose by the President, the said tribes do promise and agree, that they will not
suffer any trader to reside among them, without such licence, and that they will, from time
to time, give notice to the Superintendent, or to the agent for their tribes, of all the traders
that may be in their country.

Art. 9. In order to put a stop to the abuses and impositions which are practised upon the said
tribes, by the private traders, the United States will, at a convenient time, establish a trading
house, or factory, where the individuals of the said tribes can be supplied with goods at a
more reasonable rate, than they have been accustomed to procure them.

Art. 10. In order to evince the sincerity of their friendship and affection for the United
States, and a respectful deference for their advice, by an act which will not only be acceptable
to them, but to the common father of all the nations of the earth, the said tribes do, hereby,
promise and agree that they will put an end to the bloody war which has heretofore raged between
their tribe and the Great and Little Osages. And for the purpose of burying the tomahawk, and
renewing the friendly intercourse between themselves and the Osages, a meeting of their respective
chiefs shall take place, at which, under the direction of the above named commissioner, or
the agent of Indian affairs residing at St. Louis, an adjustment of all their differences shall
be made, and peace established upon a firm and lasting basis.

Art. 11. As it is probable that the government of the United States will establish a military
post at, or near the mouth of the Ouisconsin river, and as the land on the lower side of the
river may not be suitable for that purpose, the said tribes hereby agree, that a fort may be
built, either on the upper side of the Ouisconsin, or on the right bank of the Mississippi,
as the one or the other may be found most convenient; and a tract of land not exceeding two
miles square, shall be given for that purpose; and the said tribes do further agree, that they
will at all times, allow to traders and other persons travelling through their country, under
the authority of the United States, a free and safe passage for themselves and their property
of every description; and that for such passage, they shall at no time, and on no account whatever,
be subject to any toll or exaction.

Art. 12. This treaty shall take effect and be obligatory on the contracting parties, as soon
as the same shall be ratified by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate
of the United States.

In testimony whereof, the said William Henry Harrison, and the chiefs and head men of said
Sac and Fox tribes, have hereunto set their hands and affixed their seals. Done at St. Louis,
in the district of Louisiana, on the third day of November, one thousand, eight hundred and
four, and of the independence of the United States the twenty-ninth.

  Additional article.

It is agreed that nothing in this treaty contained shall affect the claim of any individual
or individuals, who may have obtained grants of land from the Spanish government, and which
are not included within the general boundary line, laid down in this treaty: Provided, that
such grant have at any time been made known to the said tribes and recognized by them.

On the 31st of December 1804, the President of the United States, submitted this treaty to
the Senate for their advice and consent, and it was by that body duly ratified.

In a Life of Black Hawk, dictated by himself and written by J.B. Patterson, to which there
is a certificate of authenticity appended from Antoine Le Clair. U.S. interpreter, for the
Sacs and Foxes, under date of 16th October 1833, there is the following statement concerning
the manner in which this treaty was made. I could say much more about this treaty but I will
not at this time. It has been the origin of all our difficulties." p. 27.

The power among the Indian tribes of this country to sell their lands, has always been considered
as vested in the chiefs. They, however, are accustomed to consult the whole nation, and, possibly,
it may be necessary, in all cases, that its assent should be obtained. It has not been the
practice of our government, it is believed, in its negotiations with the Indians, to institute
particular enquiries for the purpose of ascertaining, how far the chiefs were authorized to
act by their people. A number of treaties have been formed, at different times, in which the
chiefs must have acted under the general authority with which they are clothed on this point;
the circumstances of the case being such, as to have precluded all opportunity of their ascertaining
the sense of the tribes, after the negotiations had been commenced.

In the case under consideration, notwithstanding the statement of Black Hawk, there was every
reason, especially on the part of the Commissioner, for believing, that the chiefs who signed
the treaty, were fully authorized to act. In the first place, Government, in its instructions
to the Commissioner, to make a purchase of lands, of the Sacs and Foxes, had given as a reason
for it, that it was a matter of complaint, on the part of these two tribes, that they were
not, like their neighbors, receiving an annuity from the United States. They owned a very large
extent of territory, and had, comparatively, but a limited population. It was natural that
they should wish to dispose of some portion of it, for the purpose of receiving an annual supply
of goods and money. In the second place, five chiefs of the Sacs and Foxes, united in the treaty,
one of them, Pah-she-pa-ho, being at the time the great head-chief of the Sac nation. It is
admitted by Black Hawk that a council had been held by these two tribes, and that Pah-she-pa-ho
and his associates had been authorized to visit St. Louis to purchase the release of a prisoner.
It is probable that the sale of a part of their territory may have been agreed upon by this
council. In the third place, there must have been a prevailing opinion in St. Louis, that these
chiefs were authorized to act in the case. The treaty was publicly made, and a number of high-minded
and honorable men, are parties to it, in the character of commissioner, secretary, and witnesses.
Among them are several officers of the army; the first governor of the territory of Louisiana;
and Pierre Chouteau, at that time Agent for the Sac and Fox Indians, and well acquainted with
them. These circumstances forbid the idea of the treaty having been formed under circumstances
in which there were not satisfactory reasons for believing, that the Indians, parties to it
were fully authorized to act.

Black Hawk is mistaken in some things about this treaty, and it may be that he has been misinformed
in regard to the authority of his chiefs to make this sale of their lands. He says, for instance,
that the treaty was made some moons after the return of Lieutenant Pike from the sources of
the Mississippi; when in fact Pike did not leave St. Louis upon his expedition, until the 9th
of August 1805, nearly a year after the date of the treaty. Again, he says, it was made by
four of the chiefs. The treaty is signed by five. But admitting that the deputation of chiefs
transcended their authority in the sale of the lands, made at that time, it would seem that
the Sacs and Foxes acquiesced in it. They never disavowed the treaty, but have regularly received
their annuity, and, on more than one occasion, have recognized it, as binding. Even Black Hawk
and his band, made this recognition, in the treaty of peace which they signed with the United
States, at Portage des Sioux, in 1816.

It may be questioned, however, whether good faith towards the Indians and a due regard to national
honor, do not make it expedient that our government should invariably hold its treaties with
them, in their own country, and in the midst of the tribe owning the lands proposed to be purchased.
In such case, the assent of all the Indians might be obtained, and the charge of having formed
a fraudulent treaty, with unauthorized individuals, could never be raised. The peculiar relation
subsisting between the government of the United States and the Indian tribes, within its territory,
demands on on the part of the former, great delicacy of action, liberality and perfect good
faith. By such a course, alone, can our national honor be preserved untarnished.

Subsequently to the treaty of 1804, the erection by the government of the United States, of
Fort Madison on the Mississippi, above the Des Moines rapids, gave some dissatisfaction to
the Sacs and Foxes. This was increased by the British agents and traders, who instigated them
to resist the encroachments of the Americans, now beginning to press upon their hunting grounds.
Of this interference on the part of the British, with the Indians, there can be no doubt. Governor
Harrison in a letter to the secretary of war, dated Vincennes, July 15th, 1810, says, "a considerable
number of the Sacs went some time since to see the British superintendent, and on the first
instant, more passed Chicago, for the same destination." General Clark, under date of St. Louis,
July 20th, 1810, says, in writing to the same department, "One hundred and fifty Sacs are on
a visit to the British agent by invitation, and a smaller party on a visit to the island of
St. Joseph, in lake Huron." John Johnson, Esq. the Indian agent, at Fort Wayne, under date
of August 7th, 1810, says, to the secretary at war, "About one hundred Saukees have returned
from the British agent, who supplied them liberally with every thing they stood in need of.
The party received forty-seven rifles, and a number of fusils with plenty of powder and lead."

McKee, Dixon, and Girty were open and active agents in exciting the Indians to attack the American
frontiers. They held frequent talks with them and supplied them liberally with goods and munitions
of war. In 1811, there being a strong probability of a war with Great Britain, a deputation
of the Sauks and Foxes, visited Washington city, to see the President, by whom they were told
that in the event of a war taking place with England, their great father did not wish them
to interfere on either side, but to remain neutral: He did not want their assistance but desired
them to hunt and support their families and live in peace. Immediately after the war of 1812,
the Sacs and Foxes, with whom, as with Indians generally, war is the great business of life,
felt that they ought, as a matter of course, to take sides with one party or the other, and
went to St. Louis, to offer their services to the United States agent, to fight against the
British; but the offer was declined, on the ground that the government of the United States
had resolved not to employ the Indians in that capacity. The machinations of the British, were
successfully continued. The Sacs and Foxes divided upon the question of taking up arms against
the United States. A part of them claimed the protection of the American government and received
it; a part joined the British standard, Black Hawk among the number, and fought against the
Americans until the peace of 1815. The number of warriors who joined the British is supposed
to have been about two hundred, and they have ever since been known as the "British Band,"
at the head of which has been "General Black Hawk."

On the 14th September, 1815, William Clark, Ninian Edwards and Auguste Choteau, commissioners
on behalf of the United States, concluded a treaty with the chiefs and warriors of the Fox
tribe, by which all injuries and acts of hostility, committed by either party during the late
war, were to be forgiven, and peace and friendship established between the two nations. The
fourth article of the treaty contains a recognition of the former treaty in these words. "The
said Fox tribe or nation do hereby, assent to, recognize, re-establish and confirm the treaty
of St. Louis, which was concluded on the 3rd of November, 1804, to the full extent of their
interest in the same, as well as all other contracts and agreements between the parties." This
treaty was made at Portage des Sioux.

On the 13th of September, 1815, the same commissioners, at the same place, concluded a treaty
of peace and friendship with the chiefs and warriors of that part of Sac nation of Indians
residing on the Mississippi river. The first article recognizes the treaty of 1804 in the following
words. "The undersigned chiefs and warriors for themselves and that portion of the Sacs which
they represent, do hereby assent to the treaty between the United States of America and the
united tribes of Sacs and Foxes, which was concluded at St. Louis on the third of November
1804; and they moreover promise to do all in their power to re-establish and enforce the same."
There is a further provision that they will remain distinct and separate from the Sacs of Rock
river, giving them no assistance whatever, until peace shall be established between them and
the United States. The Sacs on Rock river were that part of the tribe which had been engaged
in the late war, and who now declined making a treaty with the United States, and continued,
although officially notified of the peace, to commit occasional depredations on the frontiers;
and, it was not until the following spring that hostilities on their part actually ceased.

On the 13th of May, 1816, the same commissioners effected a treaty with the chiefs and warriors
of the Sacs of Rock river, and the adjacent country. Under the 9th article of the treaty of
Ghent, concluded 24th December 1814, between the United States and Great Britain, it was stipulated,
that each party should put an end to Indian hostilities within their respective territory,
and place the tribes on the same footing upon which they stood before the war. Under this provision,
the second article of the treaty with the Sacs of Rock river, stipulated that they are placed
upon the same footing which they occupied before the late war, upon the single condition of
their restoring the property stolen by them, from the whites, subsequent to their notification
that peace had been made between the United States and Great Britain.

Under the 9th article of the treaty of 1804, the United States agreed to establish a trading-house
to supply the Sacs and Foxes with goods at a more reasonable rate than they had been accustomed
to procure them. On the third of September 1822, Maj. Thomas Forsyth, the U.S. Indian agent,
made a treaty at Fort Armstrong, with the chiefs, warriors and head men of the Sacs and Foxes,
by which, in consideration of the sum of one thousand dollars, they forever released the United
States from all obligation contained in said ninth article of the treaty of 1804.

On the fourth of August 1824, at Washington city, William Clark, Indian agent and sole commissioner
of the United States, effected a treaty with the Sacs and Foxes through their chiefs and head
men, by which, for the sum of one thousand dollars per annum for ten years, they ceded all
their interest and title to any lands claimed by them in the state of Missouri, which are situated,
lying and being between the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, and a line running from the Missouri
at the entrance of Kansas river, north one hundred miles, to the north west corner of the state
of Missouri, and from thence east to the Mississippi. By this treaty, these tribes acknowledged
the land east and south of the lines above described, so far as the Indians claim the same,
to belong to the United States, and that none of their tribes shall be permitted to settle
or hunt upon any part of it, after the first day of January 1826, without permission from the
Superintendent of Indian affairs.

Upon the 19th of August 1825, William Clark and Lewis Cass, Commissioners on behalf of the
United States, concluded a treaty at Prairie du Chien, in the territory of Michigan, with the
chiefs and warriors of the Sioux, Winnebagoes, Menominees, Chippewas, Ottawas, Pottawatamies,
Sacs, Foxes and Ioways. The objects of this treaty were the restoration of peace among the
Indian tribes, several of whom had been for some time waging war against each other; the settlement
of boundary lines between these tribes respectively, and between them and the United States.
The Commissioners succeeded in effecting a peace between the Sioux and Chippeways, and between
the Sacs, Foxes and Ioways on the one part, and the Sioux on the other; and also in adjusting
the boundary lines of the territory of each tribe to the satisfaction of all parties. Under
this treaty nothing was asked by the United States nor was any thing granted to them: the character
in which the government presented itself, being simply that of a pacificator.

The concourse of Indians assembled at this council was very great. About 3000 came to the council
ground, clothed in their war dresses, and armed with bows, war-clubs and tomahawks. The Sacs
and Foxes were the last to arrive, but were very imposing and warlike in their appearance when
they reached the ground. They ascended the Mississippi, to Prairie du Chien, in a fleet of
canoes, lashed together. They passed and repassed the town in a connected squadron, standing
erect, in their canoes, in full dress, singing their war songs. Upon landing, they drew up
in martial order, as if in warlike defiance of their bitter enemies, the Sioux, who were encamped
near the shore, and who in turn shot back the fierce look of hostility upon their ancient foe.
An eye witness describes this scene as one unique and singularly magnificent. The council was
held under a spacious booth of green boughs, and lasted for several days. Keokuk was present
on this occasion, as the head chief of the Sacs, and took an active part in the council; his
course being marked by that moderation and sound policy, for which he is eminently distinguished.

In the early part of the year 1828, the President of the United States, appointed Governor
Cass and Colonel Pierre Menard, to treat with certain tribes of Indians for the cession of
what is called the "mineral region" lying on the Mississippi, south of the Wisconsin. The commissioners
arrived at Green Bay late in the summer of that year, and on the 25th of August, made a temporary
agreement with the Indians, by which the whites were allowed to occupy the country where the
lead mines were worked; and in the ensuing year a treaty was to be held with the Indians for
the purchase of the mineral country: in the mean time, no white was to cross a certain line,
described in said agreement, to dig for ore; and finally the Indians were paid twenty thousand
dollars in goods, for the trespasses already committed on their lands by the miners. This agreement
was ratified by the President and senate of the United States on the 7th January, 1829. Soon
after President Jackson came into office in 1829, he appointed General McNeil of the army,
to fill the place of Governor Cass in the said commission, which was to meet at St. Louis and
under the agreement above described, proceed to the mineral region, to effect by treaty, its
purchase. In consequence of some disagreement in opinion between these two commissioners, the
President subsequently united with them, Caleb Atwater, Esq. of Ohio. They reached Prairie
du Chien about the middle of July, where they met deputies on the part of the Winnebagoes,
Chippeways, Ottowas, Pottawatimies, Sioux, Sauks, Foxes and Menominees; and on the first of
August, a treaty was concluded for about eight millions of acres, extending from the upper
end of Rock island to the mouth of the Wisconsin, from latitude 41° 15' to latitude 43° 15'
on the Mississippi. Following the meanderings of the river the tract is about two hundred and
forty miles from south to north. It extends along the Wisconsin and Fox rivers from west to
east so as to give a passage across the country from the Mississippi to lake Michigan. At this
treaty Keokuk and Morgan, with two hundred warriors of the Sac and Fox tribes were present,
and according to the statement of one of the commissioners, rendered essential service to them,
by intimidating the Winebagoes, who from some dissatisfaction, threatened to assassinate the
commissioners and those associated with them.

On the 21st Sept. 1832, after the conclusion of the Black Hawk war, General Scott and Governor
Reynolds concluded a treaty with the Sacs and Foxes, by which about six million acres of land
were acquired, for which the United States were to pay them the sum of twenty thousand dollars
per annum for thirty years, to pay off the debts of the tribes and to support, at the discretion
of the President, a black and gun smith among them. A reservation was made of forty miles square,
on the Ioway river in favor of Keokuk, (since purchased,) including his village, as a reward
for his fidelity to the United Slates. Black Hawk, his son and the Prophet were to be held
as hostages during the pleasure of the President. This is known as the "Black Hawk purchase."
The whole of the six millions lie upon the west side of the Mississippi and are included within
the following boundaries: Beginning on the Mississippi river at the point where the Sac and
Fox northern boundary line is established, by the second article of the treaty of Prairie des
Chiens of 15th July, 1830, strikes said river; thence up said boundary line to a point fifty
miles from the Mississippi, measured on said line to the nearest point on the Red Cedar of
Iowa, forty miles from the Mississippi river; thence in a right line to a point in the northern
boundary of the state of Missouri fifty miles measured on said boundary from the Mississippi
river; thence by the last mentioned boundary to the Mississippi river, and by the western shore
of said river to the place of beginning.

The Sac and Fox tribes are now residing on the west side of the Mississippi, and are living
upon friendly terms with the United States. As a general remark, it may be said, that their
intercourse with the United States has been of a pacific character. They took no part in the
war of the Revolution: they were not parties to the Indian disturbances which terminated in
the treaty of Greenville in 1795. Tecumseh and the Prophet failed to enlist them in their grand
confederacy against the Americans, which was nearly broken up by the premature battle of Tippecanoe.
The machinations of the British agents and traders, backed by the most liberal distribution
of goods and fire arms, induced but a small party of them, not exceeding two hundred, to join
the British standard in the late war with England. In the still more recent disturbance, on
the frontiers of Illinois, called the "Black Hawk war," but a portion of these tribes, took
up arms against the United States, the great mass of them refusing to take any part in it;
while Keokuk, their principal chief, exerted all his influence to dissuade the "British Band"
from engaging in so hopeless a contest.

MA-KA-TAI-ME-SHE-KIA-KIAH,

OR

BLACK HAWK.

Black Hawk is a remarkable instance of an individual, in no wise gifted with any uncommon physical,
moral or intellectual endowments, obtaining, by the force of circumstances, the most extraordinary
celebrity. Since the year 1831, his name has been familiarly known to the people of the United
States; and the terror, which for a brief period, it excited upon the frontiers of Illinois,
Missouri and Indiana, was only surpassed by the curiosity which pervaded every part of the
union, to behold this notable chief of the woods, after he had been conquered, and was carried
a prisoner of state, from the wilds of the West to the Atlantic sea-board. His tour through
the United States, partook largely of the triumphal march of a successful hero. In the number
of persons who flocked around him, the honors which he received were scarcely less flattering
than those awarded to the illustrious Lafayette, while the "nation's guest." In the one case
there was curiosity alone, in the other, curiosity and gratitude blended. To the casual observer,
the distinction between the two cases is not very apparent.

The causes which created a desire so universal, to behold this aboriginal chief, have awakened
a corresponding interest in the public mind, to learn more of his history, than was revealed
in the events of the campaign of 1832. To gratify this curiosity, is the object of the present
volume. The author has carefully consulted all the sources of information, touching the life
and character of Black Hawk, that were within his reach; and has studiously avoided the presentation
of any fact which did not seem to be well authenticated. Should the incidents here narrated,
in the life of this celebrated Indian, not prove as rich and amusing as might be anticipated,
from the wide spread notoriety which he has obtained, the work will still be found of some
value. It presents in a connected form, and as the author trusts, with historic accuracy, one
link in the great chain of political relations between the United States and the Indian tribes
of North America. Every day is increasing the interest and magnitude of these relations, and
any effort to preserve the facts with which they are associated, would seem to be worthy of
public consideration. Black Hawk may die, his name be forgotten, and the smoke of his wigwam
be seen no more, but the "Black Hawk war" will long form a page of deep interest, in the history
of this country.

The subject of this memoir is by birth a Sac, having been born at the principal Sac village,
on Rock River, in the year, as he himself states, 1767. His father's name was Py-e-sa, his
grandfather's Na-na-ma-kee or Thunder. Black Hawk was not by birth a chief, but at the early
age of fifteen, having distinguished himself by wounding an enemy, he was permitted to paint
and wear feathers; and was placed in the rank of the Braves. About the year 1783, he united
in an expedition against the Osages, and had the good fortune to kill and scalp one of the
enemy: for this act of youthful valor, he was, for the first time, permitted to mingle in the
scalp-dance. This triumph was followed shortly afterwards by two more excursions against the
same tribe. In the first, Black Hawk was the leader of seven men, who suddenly attacked a party
of one hundred Osages, killed one of them, and as suddenly retreated without loss. This exploit,
so far increased the number of his followers, that he soon afterwards started with a party
of one hundred and eighty braves, and marched to an Osage village, on the Missouri; but found
it deserted. Most of the party being disappointed, left their leader and returned home. Black
Hawk, however, with but five followers, pursued the trail of the enemy, and after some days
succeeded in killing one man and a boy; and, securing their scalps, returned home. In the year
1786, having recovered from the effect of his late unsuccessful excursion, Black Hawk found
himself once more at the head of two hundred braves, and again set off to avenge the repeated
outrages of the Osages upon the Sac nation. Soon after he reached the enemy's country, he met
a party about equal in number to his own. A battle ensued. The Osages lost near one hundred
men, and Black Hawk nineteen. He claims, in the attack, to have killed five of the enemy, with
his own hand. This severe engagement had the effect, for some time, of keeping the Osages upon
their own lands and arresting their depredations upon the Sacs. This cessation of hostilities
gave the latter an opportunity of redressing the wrongs which the Cherokees had committed upon
them, by murdering some of their women and children. A party was raised for this purpose, and
met the Cherokees upon the Merrimack river, below St. Louis, the latter being most numerous.
In this battle Py-e-sa, the father of Black Hawk was killed. The Cherokees were compelled to
retreat with the loss of twenty-eight men, the Sacs having but seven killed. Upon the fall
of Py-e-sa, Black Hawk assumed the command and also took possession of the "medicine bag,"
then in the keeping of his father. Owing to the disasters of this expedition, and especially
the death of his father, Black Hawk, for the ensuing five years, refrained from all warlike
operations, and spent his time in fishing and hunting. At the end of this period, being about
the year 1800, he made another excursion, against the Osages, at the head of about five hundred
Sacs and Foxes and a hundred Ioways, who had joined him as allies. After a long march they
reached and destroyed about forty lodges of the enemy, killing many of their bravest warriors,
five of whom were slain by the leader of the invading army. In the year 1802, he terminated
a severe and protracted campaign against the Chippewas, Kaskaskias and Osages, during which
six or seven battles were fought and more than one hundred of the enemy killed. The following
summer Black Hawk made one of his periodical visits to St. Louis to see his Spanish father,
by whom he was well received. Upon his next visit to this Spanish dignitary, he found many
sad and gloomy faces, because the United States were about to take possession of the town and
country around it. "Soon after the Americans arrived," says Black Hawk, "I took my band and
went to take leave, for the last time, of our father. The Americans came to see him also. Seeing
them approach, we passed out at one door, as they entered at another--and immediately started,
in our canoes, for our village on Rock river--not liking the change any more than our friends
appeared to at St. Louis. On arriving at our village, we gave the news that strange people
had taken St. Louis, and that we should never see our Spanish father again. This information
made all our people sorry. Sometime afterwards (1805) a boat came up the river with a young
American chief (Lieutenant, afterwards General Pike,) and a small party of soldiers. We heard
of them, soon after he had passed Salt river. Some of our young braves watched him every day,
to see what sort of people he had on board. The boat at length arrived at Rock river, and the
young chief came on shore with his interpreter--made a speech, and gave us some presents. We,
in return, presented him with meat and such provisions as we could spare. We were well pleased
with the speech of the young chief. He gave us good advice; said our American father would
treat us well. He presented us an American flag, which was hoisted. He then requested us to
pull down our British flags, and give him our British medals--promising to send us others on
his return to St. Louis. This we declined as we wished to have two fathers."

Subsequently to this period, the building of Fort Edwards, near the head of the Des Moyens
rapids, gave much uneasiness to the Sacs. Some of the chiefs and a party of their followers
went down to this point, and had an interview with the war chief who had command of the troops
engaged in constructing the fort. The Indians became satisfied and returned home. Not long
afterwards a party, of which Black Hawk was one, determined to attack and take Fort Madison,
standing upon the west side of the Mississippi, above the mouth of the Des Moyens, which was
then garrisoned with about fifty men. Their spies having ascertained that the troops marched
out of the fort every morning to exercise, they concealed themselves near it, with an agreement
to fire upon them when they came out. About sun rise, on the morning of the proposed attack,
the gate opened, and a young man made his appearance, but was suffered to return without being
molested. The gate was again opened and four soldiers came out. They were followed by a fifth,
who was instantly killed. The others then ran for the fort, but two of them were shot down
before they reached it. The Indians continued for two days, shooting into the fort, and endeavoring
to set fire to it. Finding their efforts unavailing, they gave up the attack and returned home.

The period had now arrived when the difficulties between this country and Great Britain, were
to be settled by an appeal to arms. Some discontent had prevailed among the Sacs, in regard
to the encroachments of the Americans upon their hunting grounds. They, however, offered their
services to the United States, to fight against the British, but their offer was declined.
They had not been as liberally supplied with presents and goods at Fort Madison, as they had
anticipated, and in the mean time, the British agents had artfully fomented their discontent,
and labored to win their confidence by the most liberal distribution among them of goods and
ardent spirits. Shortly after the declaration of war, Girty, a British trader, arrived at Rock
island with two boats loaded with goods, and the British flag was hoisted. He informed the
Indians that he had been sent to them by Colonel Dixon, with presents, a large silk flag and
a keg of rum. The day after his arrival, the goods were divided among the Indians, they promising
to pay for them, in furs, in the following spring. Girty informed Black Hawk that Colonel Dixon
was then at Green Bay, with a large quantity of goods, arms and ammunition, and was desirous
that he should raise a party of warriors and join him. Black Hawk succeeded in collecting about
two hundred braves, and soon reached Green Bay, where he found Dixon encamped, with a large
body of Indians, assembled from other tribes, who had been already furnished with clothing
and with arms. Black Hawk had an interview with Dixon, two other war chiefs and the interpreter.
"He received me," says Black Hawk, "with a hearty shake of the hand, and presented me to the
other chiefs, who shook my hand cordially, and seemed much pleased to see me. After I was seated,
Colonel Dixon said, "General Black Hawk, I sent for you, to explain to you, what we are going
to do, and the reasons that have brought us here. Our friend Girty, informs us in the letter
you brought from him, what has taken place. You will now have to hold us fast by the hand.
Your English father has found out that the Americans want to take your country from you, and
has sent me and his braves to drive them back to their own country. He has likewise sent a
large quantity of arms and ammunition, and we want all your warriors to join us." He then placed
a medal round my neck, and gave me a paper, (which I lost in the late war,) and a silk flag,
saying, "You are to command all the braves that will leave here the day after to-morrow, to
join our braves near Detroit."

On the following day, arms, clothing, knives and tomahawks, were distributed to Black Hawk's
band, and upon the succeeding morning, they started, in all near five hundred braves, to join
the British army. This was in August, 1812, shortly after the surrender and massacre of the
American troops at Chicago, which place they passed a few days after it had been evacuated.
Of the movements of Black Hawk during his connection with the British upon our north west,
no satisfactory information has been obtained. It appears that he was in two engagements, but
seems not to have distinguished himself. The last of these was the attack, in August 1813,
upon Fort Stephenson, then under the command of Major Croghan. The gallant defence of this
post, and the fatal repulse given to the combined British and Indian forces, seem to have disheartened
Black Hawk; for soon afterwards, tired of successive defeats, and disappointed in not obtaining
the "spoils of victory," he left the army, with about twenty of his followers, and returned
to his village on Rock river. It is probable that he would have remained neutral during the
remainder of the war, had it not been for one of those border outrages, which lawless and unprincipled
white men but too often commit upon the Indians, under pretence of self defence or retaliation,
often a mere pretext for wanton bloodshed and murder. Previous to joining Colonel Dixon, Black
Hawk had visited the lodge of an old friend, whose son he had adopted and taught to hunt. He
was anxious that this youth should go with him and his band and join the British standard,
but the father objected on the ground that he was dependent upon his son for game; and, moreover,
that he did not wish him to fight against the Americans who had always treated him kindly.
He had agreed to spend the following winter near a white settler, upon Salt river, one of the
tributaries of the Mississippi which enters that stream below the Des Moyens, and intended
to take his son with him. As Black Hawk was approaching his village on Rock river, after his
campaign on the lakes with Dixon, he observed a smoke rising from a hollow in the bluff of
the stream. He went to see who was there. Upon drawing near to the fire, he discovered a mat
stretched, and an old man of sorrowful aspect sitting under it, alone, and evidently humbling
himself before the Great Spirit, by fasting and prayer. It proved to be his old friend, the
father of his adopted son. Black Hawk seated himself beside him and inquired what had happened,
but received no answer, for indeed he seemed scarcely alive. Being revived by some water, he
looked up, recognized the friend of his youth, and in reply to Black Hawk's second inquiry,
said, in a feeble voice,

"Soon after your departure to join the British, I descended the river with a small party, to
winter at the place I told you the white man had requested me to come to. When we arrived,
I found a fort built, and the white family that had invited me to come and hunt near them,
had removed to it. I then paid a visit to the fort, to tell the white people that myself and
little band were friendly, and that we wished to hunt in the vicinity of their fort. The war
chief, who commanded it, told me that we might hunt on the Illinois side of the Mississippi,
and no person would trouble us. That the horsemen only ranged on the Missouri side, and he
had directed them not to cross the river. I was pleased with this assurance of safety, and
immediately crossed over and made my winter's camp. Game was plenty: We lived happy and often
talked of you. My boy regretted your absence, and the hardships you would have to undergo.
We had been here about two moons, when my boy went out as usual to hunt. Night came on and
he did not return. I was alarmed for his safety and passed a sleepless night. In the morning
my old woman went to the other lodges and gave the alarm, and all turned out in pursuit. There
being snow on the ground, they soon came upon his track, and after pursuing it some distance,
found that he was on the trail of a deer, that led to the river. They soon came to the place
where he had stood and fired, and found a deer hanging upon the branch of a tree, which had
been skinned. But here also were found the tracks of white men. They had taken my boy prisoner.
Their tracks led across the river, and then down towards the fort. My friends followed them,
and soon found my boy lying dead. He had been most cruelly murdered. His face was shot to pieces,
his body stabbed in several places, and his head scalped. His arms were tied behind him."

The old man ceased his narrative, relapsed into the stupor from which he had been aroused and
in a few minutes, expired. Black Hawk remained by his body during the night, and next day buried
it upon the peak of the bluff. Shocked at the cruel fate of his adopted son, and deeply touched
by the mournful death of his old comrade, he was roused to vengeance against the Americans,
and after remaining a few days at the village, and raising a band of braves, prepared for offensive
operations upon the frontiers.

Having narrated to his band the murder of his adopted son, they began to thirst for blood,
and agreed to follow Black Hawk wheresoever he might lead. The party consisted of about thirty.
They descended the Mississippi in canoes to the place where Fort Madison had stood, but found
it abandoned by the American troops and burnt. They continued their course down the river and
landed near Cap au Gris, on the 10th of May, where they killed one of the United States Rangers,
named Bernard, but were driven off by Lieutenant Massey, with a detachment from Fort Howard.
The Indians, however, rallied in the woods, and on the 24th of May, a severe battle and of
a character somewhat novel, was fought between the troops at Fort Howard, under Lieutenant
Drakeford of the U. S. Rangers, and Black Hawk and his party. The former, in his official report
of this engagement, says,

"Yesterday, about twelve o'clock, five of our men went out to some cabins on the bluff, about
one quarter of a mile below the fort, to bring a grind-stone. The backwater of the Mississippi,
rendered it so they went in a canoe. On their return they were attacked by a party of Indians,
supposed to be about fifty in number; they killed and tomahawked three and wounded one mortally.
While about this mischief, we gave them as good a fire from a little below the fort, as the
breadth of the backwater would permit. Captain Craig and myself with about forty men, waded
across the water and pursued them: in going about half a mile, we came on them and commenced
a fire which continued about one hour, part of which time at a distance of forty steps, and
no part of the time further than a hundred and fifty steps: shortly after the commencement
of the battle, we were reinforced by Captain Musick and twenty of his men; the enemy now ran;
some made their escape, and others made to a sink-hole that is in the battle ground, and from
there they returned a most rapid fire; it being very dangerous, to approach nearer than fifty
steps of the sink, we at length erected a breast-work, on the two wheels of a wagon, and resolved
upon moving it up to the edge of the sink, to fire from behind, down into the sink and preserve
us from theirs. We got the moving battery finished about sunset, and moved it up with a sufficient
number of men behind it, whilst all other posts round were sufficiently guarded, in case they
should be put to the route.

"We had not moved to within less than ten steps of the sink, before they commenced a fire,
which we returned at every opportunity. Night came on and we were obliged to leave the ground,
and decline the expectation of taking them out without risking man for man, which we thought
not a good exchange on our side. During the time of the battle another party of Indians commenced
a brisk fire on the fort. Captain Craig was killed in the commencement of the battle, Lieut.
Edward Spears at the moving of the breast work to the sink. The morning of the 25th we returned
to the ground and found five Indians killed and the sign of a great many wounded, that had
been taken off in the night. The aggregate number of killed on our part is one captain, one
third lieutenant, and five privates; three wounded, one missing, one citizen killed and two
wounded mortally."

Black Hawk states that but eighteen of his men were in the sink with him, and that they dug
holes in the sides of the bank, with their knives, to protect them from the fire of the Americans:
Some of his warriors commenced singing their death songs; but he, several times called out
to the enemy, if brave men, to come down and fight them. He describes the wagon-battery, and
its inefficiency in dislodging them from their depressed but safe situation. His retreat to
the sink-hole under the circumstances, was a sound military movement. Lieutenant Drakeford
having withdrawn his forces, Black Hawk and his party left their intrenchment and returned
by land, to their village.

The tribes of Indians on the Mississippi, were notified in the early part of this year, 1815,
that peace had been concluded between the United States and England. Most of those who had
been engaged in the war, ceased hostilities. Black Hawk, however, and his band, and some of
the Pottawatamies, were not inclined to bury the tomahawk. Even as late as the spring of 1816,
they committed depredations. Some palliation for these outrages may be found in the fact, that
the British, on the north-west frontier, long after they were officially notified of the peace,
continued to excite the Indians to acts of violence against the United States; and, indeed,
participated in them likewise. It was in the spring of this year that they captured the garrison
at Prairie du Chien, and instigated Black Hawk and his party to attack some boats, which were
ascending the Mississippi to that point, with troops and provisions. In this attack, Black
Hawk was the leader. One of the boats was captured and several of the crew killed. They were
compelled to return, and dropped down to the fort at the mouth of the Des Moyens river. As
a reward for their attack upon these boats, the British agents distributed rum among the Indians
engaged in the affair, and joined with them in dancing and feasting.

In May, Black Hawk and his party, having been again summoned by the Americans, to make peace,
concluded to descend the Mississippi to Portage des Sioux, to meet the American commissioners
who were there for that purpose. On the 13th of May, 1816, a treaty of peace was signed by
Clark, Edwards, and Choteau on behalf of the United States, and the chiefs and warriors of
the Sacs of Rock river and the adjacent country. To this treaty Black Hawk was a party. It
recognizes the validity of the treaty of St. Louis, of November 1804.

From the treaty of peace, between the United States and the Sac Indians of Rock river, in 1816,
to the commencement of hostilities between these parties in 1832, the life of Black Hawk seems
to have been quiet and monotonous, occasionally relieved by a warlike excursion, but generally
spent in hunting, throughout the winter, and in loitering about his village, during the summer.
Such, indeed, is the life of most Indians. Having no intellectual pursuits and little desire
for the acquisition of property, beyond the supply of their immediate wants, they have in reality
but two sources of excitement--war and the chase. They take no interest in the domestic affairs
of their families, have little taste for the pursuits of agriculture, and, if not engaged in
hostile excursions, in following the deer, or in trapping the beaver, they sink into listless
inactivity. It is highly probable that many of their wars are undertaken, more for the gratification
of that love of excitement, which is an indestructible element of the human mind, than from
any constitutional proneness to cruelty and bloodshed. They need both physical and intellectual
excitation, and having none of the resources which mental and moral culture throws open to
civilized man, they seek it in making war upon each other or upon the wild animals which share
with them the woods and the prairies.

Subsequently to the treaty of 1816, and perhaps in that year, the government of the United
States built Fort Armstrong, upon Rock Island, in the Mississippi river, and but a few miles
from the village where Black Hawk and his band resided. This measure, though not actually opposed,
was by no means acceptable to them. They probably did not relish the gradual advances upon
them, of the white population; but they entertained, moreover, a special regard for this beautiful
island, which is justly considered one of the finest in the whole extent of the Mississippi.
It is fertile, and produces many varieties of nuts and fruits, and being in the rapids of the
stream, the waters which lave its shores, yield an abundance of excellent fish. In addition
to all this, they have a traditionary belief, that the island was the favorite residence of
a good spirit which dwelt in a cave in the rocks on which Fort Armstrong now stands. This spirit
had often been seen by the Indians, but after the erection of the Fort, alarmed by the noise
and intrusion of the white man, it spread its beautiful, swan-like wings, and disappeared.
During the year 1817, the Sacs sent out some warriors against the Sioux, and succeeded in killing
several of them, but Black Hawk was not of the party. About this time, his eldest son sickened
and died, and within a short period afterwards, he lost his youngest daughter. This affliction
seems to have made a deep impression upon him; and according to a custom common among the Indians,
he blacked his face, and for the ensuing two years lived at home, in seclusion, drinking water
at mid-day, and eating boiled corn but sparingly, in the evening. In the winter of 1819-20,
there was a disturbance between the Sacs and Ioways, one of the latter having killed a young
man belonging to the former. Under the agreement of a late council between these two tribes,
the old custom of appeasing the friends of one who had been killed, by presents, had been abolished,
and each party had promised, that in future, the murderer should be surrendered up, that he
might be punished with death. A party of Sacs, of which Black Hawk was one, agreed to visit
the Ioway village on this occasion, and when about to depart, called at the lodge of the young
man who had committed the outrage, to take him along. He was sick, but still ready to accompany
them. His brother interfered, and insisted that he was too unwell to travel; that he would
himself go and die in his place, and finally set off with the party. On the seventh day, they
reached the Ioway village. They dismounted a short distance from it, and bid farewell to their
young brave, who went calmly forwards, alone, singing his death-song, and seated himself in
the middle of the lodges. One of the Ioway chiefs went out to Black Hawk, who told him the
brother had come in the place of the young man that had committed the murder, he being sick.
Black Hawk and his party, now mounted their horses and set off on their return; and casting
their eyes towards the village, saw the Ioways, armed with spears and clubs, gathering around
the young prisoner. At night the returning party, having stopped and kindled a fire, were suddenly
alarmed by the tramping of horses. They immediately stood to their arms, but were soon relieved,
by finding, instead of a foe, their young brave, unhurt and in the possession of two horses.
They ascertained that the Ioways, at first threatened him with instant death, but finally,
changing their purpose, had given him something to eat, smoked the pipe with him, and presenting
him with two horses, bid him return home in safety. The generous conduct of the Ioways is deserving
of praise, but the genuine affection of this young brave, in nobly volunteering to die in place
of his sick brother, presents one of those rare cases of self-devotion, which should be held
in remembrance.

In the following autumn, Black Hawk and some of his band went on a visit to their British father
at Malden and received presents from him. A medal was given to Black Hawk for his fidelity
to the British in the late war, and he was requested to come up annually, to that place, with
his band, and receive such presents, as had been promised them by Colonel Dixon, when they
joined the English forces. These visits were regularly made, it is believed, from that time
down to the year 1832. It is owing to this circumstance that Black Hawk's party has long been
known by the appellation of the "British Band."

In the winter of 1822, Black Hawk and his party, encamped on the Two-rivers, for the purpose
of hunting, and while there was so badly treated by some white men, that his prejudices against
the Americans were greatly strengthened. He was accused of having killed the hogs of some settlers,
who, meeting him one day in the woods, wrested his gun from his hands, and discharging it in
the air, beat him so severely with sticks that for several nights he was unable to sleep. They
then returned him his gun and ordered him to leave the neighborhood. Of the perpetration of
this outrage, there is little doubt, while the fact of Black Hawk's having committed the offence
charged upon him, rests, at best, upon suspicion. Supposing him to have been guilty, and the
supposition is at variance with the whole tenor of his intercourse with the whites, it was
on their part, one of those brutal appeals to club law, which are but too often practised towards
the Indians; and which, when avenged by them, not unfrequently brings upon their nation, the
power and the arms of the United States.

The ensuing summer, the expediency of a removal of the whole of the Sacs and Foxes, to the
west side of the Mississippi, was urged upon them by the agent at Fort Armstrong. The principal
Fox chief, as well as Keokuk, assented to the removal. The latter sent a messenger through
the village informing the Indians that it was the wish of their great Father, the President,
that they should remove, and he pointed out the Ioway river as presenting a fine situation
for their new village. There was a party, however, among the Sacs, made up principally of the
"British Band," who were decidedly opposed to a removal; and they called upon their old leader,
Black Hawk, for his opinion on the question. He took the ground that the land on which their
village stood had never been sold; that the Americans had, therefore, no right to insist upon
the measure, and that as a matter of policy he was opposed to it. The old man was probably
swayed in his decision by another cause. He felt that his power in the tribe was waning before
the rising popularity of Keokuk. Here was a question on which their people differed in opinion.
By placing himself at the head of one of the parties, he might recover his influence, or at
least sustain himself against the overshadowing ascendancy of his rival. He had an interview
with Keokuk to see if the matter could not be adjusted with the President, by giving him other
lands in exchange for those on which their village stood; and the latter promised to see the
great chief at St. Louis, on the subject. During the following winter, while Black Hawk and
his party were absent on a hunting expedition, several white families arrived at their village,
destroyed some of their lodges and commenced making fences over their corn-fields. Black Hawk
upon hearing of this movement, promptly returned to Rock river, and found his own lodge occupied
by the whites. He went to Fort Armstrong and complained to the interpreter, the agent being
absent. He crossed the Mississippi and travelled several days to converse with the Winnebago
sub-agent, who concurred with the interpreter in advising the Sacs to remove to Keokuk's settlement
on the Ioway. He then visited the prophet, Wabokieshiek, or White-Cloud, whose opinions were
held in much respect by the Sacs and Winnebagoes. He urged Black Hawk not to remove, but to
persuade Keokuk and his party to return to Rock river, assuring them that if they remained
quietly at their village, the whites would not venture to disturb them. He then rejoined his
hunting party, and in the spring when they returned to their village, they found the white
settlers still there, and that the greater part of their corn-fields had been enclosed by fences.
About that time Keokuk visited Rock river and endeavored to persuade the remainder of the Sacs
to follow him to the Ioway. He had accomplished nothing with the great chief at St. Louis,
in regard to their remaining at their village, and as a matter of policy, that peace might
be preserved, he was warmly in favor of the proposed removal. Black Hawk considered it an act
of cowardice to yield up their village and the graves of their fathers, to strangers, who had
no right to the soil, and the breach between Keokuk and himself was widened.

The white immigrants continued to increase, and the Sac village was the great point of attraction
to them. It was situated on the neck of land formed by the junction of Rock river with the
Mississippi, and had been the chief village of the tribe for sixty or seventy years. "Their
women had broken the surface of the surrounding prairie with their hoes, and enclosed with
a kind of flimsy pole fence, many fields, which were annually cultivated by them, in the raising
of corn, beans, potatoes and squashes. They had also erected several hundred houses of various
dimensions, some probably an hundred feet in length by forty or fifty broad; which were constructed
of poles and forks, arranged so as to form a kind of frame, which was then enclosed with the
bark of trees, which, being peeled off and dried under a weight for the purpose of keeping
it expanded, was afterwards confined to the walls and roof by means of cords, composed of the
bark of other trees. This indeed is a delightful spot:--on the north-west rolls the majestic
Mississippi, while the dark forests which clothe the numerous islands of Rock river, with its
several rippling streams on the south-east, form a delightful contrast, which is rendered still
more pleasing from the general declivity of the surrounding country, as it sinks gradually
away to the shores of these rivers. This ancient village had literally become the grave-yard
of the nation. Scarcely an individual could be found in the whole nation, who had not deposited
the remains of some relative, in or near to this place. Thither the mother, with mournful and
melancholy step, annually repaired to pay a tribute of respect to her departed offspring; while
the weeping sisters and loud lamenting widows, joined the procession of grief; sometimes, in
accordance with their own feelings, no doubt, but always in pursuance of an established custom
of their nation, from time immemorial. On these occasions they carefully clear away every spear
of grass or other vegetable, which they find growing near the grave, and make such repairs
as may be thought necessary. They also carry to the grave some kind of food, which they leave
there for the spirit of the deceased: and before they conclude these ceremonies, they often,
in a very melancholy and lamenting mood, address the dead, enquiring how they fare, and who,
or whether any one performs for them the kind offices of mother, sister or wife; together with
many other enquiries which a frantic imagination may happen to suggest. This being one of the
most important religious duties, is scrupulously observed by all the better class of this people."[4]

The whites who established themselves at this place, in violation of the laws of congress,
and the provisions of the treaty of 1804, committed various aggressions upon the Indians, such
as destroying their corn, killing their domestic animals, and whipping the women and children.
They carried with them, as articles of traffic, whiskey and other intoxicating liquors, and
by distributing them in the tribe, made drunkenness and scenes of debauchery common. Black
Hawk and the other chiefs of the band, remonstrated against these encroachments, and especially
in regard to the introduction of spirituous liquors among their people: and, upon one occasion,
when a white man continued, openly, to sell whiskey to them, the old chief, taking with him
one or two companions, went to his house, rolled out the barrel of whiskey, broke in the head,
and emptied its contents upon the ground, in presence of the owner. This was done, as he alleges,
from the fear that some of the white persons would be killed by his people when in a state
of intoxication. Thus things wore on until 1827. During that winter, while the Indians were
making their periodical hunt, some of the whites, in the hope of expediting their removal to
the west side of the Mississippi, set on fire, in one day, about forty of their lodges, a number
of which were entirely consumed. When the Indians returned in the spring and demanded satisfaction
for the destruction of their property, they were met by new insults and outrages.

In the summer of 1829, Black Hawk happened to meet, at Rock island, with the late governor
Coles, of whom he had heard as a great chief of Illinois, in company with "another chief" as
he calls him--Judge Hall. Having failed in his appeals to the Indian agents, for redress of
the grievances of his people, he determined to apply to these two chiefs, on the subject, and
accordingly waited upon them for that purpose.

He spoke of the indignity perpetrated upon himself, (his having been beaten with sticks by
the whites,) with the feeling that a respectable person among us would have shown under such
circumstances; and pointing to a black mark on his face, said that he wore it as a symbol of
disgrace. The customs of his nation required, that he should avenge the wrong that he had received,
but he chose rather to submit to it for the present than involve them in a war. And this was
the only alternative, for if an Indian should kill, or even strike a white man, the aggression
would be eagerly seized upon and exaggerated; the whole frontier population would rush to war,
and the Indians would be hunted from their houses like wild beasts. He spoke of the intrusion
upon their fields, the destruction of their growing corn, the ploughing up of the graves of
their fathers, and the beating of their women; and added, "we dare not resent any of these
things. If we did, it would be said that the Indians were disturbing the white people, and
troops would be sent out to destroy us." We enquired, "why do you not represent these things
to our government?--the President is a wise and a good ruler, who would protect you." "Our
great father is too far off, he cannot hear our voice." "But you could have letters written
and sent to him." "So we could," was his reply, "but the white men would write letters, and
say that we told lies. Our great father would not believe an Indian, in preference to his own
children."[5] Black Hawk in reference to this interview, says, "Neither of them could do any
thing for us; but both evidently appeared very sorry. It would give me great pleasure at all
times, to take these two chiefs by the hand." It was not until the year, 1829, that any part
of the lands upon Rock river, were brought into market by the United States. It follows as
a matter of course, that all the white settlers upon them prior to this period, were trespassers,
being there in violation of the laws of Congress, and the provisions of the treaty. Although
the frontier settlements of Illinois, had not approached within fifty or sixty miles of Rock
river, and the lands for a still greater distance around it, had not been offered for sale,
yet in this year, government was induced to make sale of a few quarter sections, at the mouth
of Rock river, including the Sac village. The reason for this uncalled for measure, is obvious--to
evade the provisions of the foregoing treaty of cession, and create a pretext for the immediate
removal of the Indians to the west side of the Mississippi.

In the spring of 1830, when Black Hawk and his band returned from their annual hunt, to occupy
their lodges, and prepare as usual for raising their crop of vegetables, they found, that the
land in and around their village, had been brought into market, and that their old friend,
the trader at Rock Island had purchased a considerable part of it. Black Hawk, greatly disturbed
at this new condition of things, appealed to the agent at that place, who informed him, that
the lands having been sold by government to individuals, he and his party had no longer any
right to remain upon them. Black Hawk was still unwilling to assent to a removal, and in the
course of the summer, he visited Malden to consult his British father on the subject, and returned
by Detroit to see the great American chief, Governor Cass, residing there. Both of these persons
told him that if the Indians had not sold their lands and would remain quietly upon them, they
would not be disturbed. Black Hawk, acting upon the assumption that the land on which their
village stood, never had been legally sold to the United States, returned home determined to
keep possession of it. It was late in the fall when he arrived: his people had gone to their
hunting grounds for the winter and he followed them. They made an unsuccessful hunt and the
season passed off in gloom. Keokuk again exerted his influence to induce them to desert Black
Hawk and remove to the Ioway. Such, however, was their attachment to their favorite village,
that the whole band returned to it in the spring of 1831. The agent at Rock island forthwith
notified them that if they did not remove from the land, troops would be sent by the United
States to drive them off. Black Hawk says, he had a conference, about this time, with the trader
at Rock Island, who enquired of him, if some terms could not be made, upon which he and his
party would agree to remove to the west side of the Mississippi. To this he replied, that if
his great father would do justice to them and make the proposition, they would remove. He was
asked by the trader, "if the great chief at St. Louis would give six thousand dollars, to purchase
provisions and other articles," if he would give up peaceably and remove. To this he agreed.
The trader accordingly sent a message to the agent at St. Louis, that Black Hawk, and his whole
band, could be removed for the sum of six thousand dollars, but the answer was, that nothing
would be given, and that if they did not remove immediately, an armed force would be sent to
compel them.

The squaws had now planted their corn, and it was beginning to grow, when the whites again
commenced ploughing it up. Black Hawk at last determined to put a stop to these aggressions
upon his people, and accordingly gave notice to those who were perpetrating them, that they
must remove, forthwith, from his village. In the mean time, after the return of the Indians,
which took place in April, eight of the white settlers united in a memorial to the Executive
of the state of Illinois, in which they set forth that the Sac Indians of Rock river had "threatened
to kill them; that they had acted in a most outrageous manner; threw down their fences, turned
horses into their corn-fields, stole their potatoes, saying the land was theirs and that they
had not sold it,--although said deponents had purchased the land of the United States' government:
levelled deadly weapons at the citizens, and on some occasions hurt said citizens for attempting
to prevent the destruction of their property," &c. &c. The memorial concludes with the still
more startling outrage, that the said Indians went "to a house, rolled out a barrel of whiskey
and destroyed it." One of these eight afflicted memorialists, swore the other seven to the
truth of their statements, and with an earnest prayer for immediate relief, it was placed before
his Excellency, on the 19th of May.

This long catalogue of outrages, backed by other memorials, and divers rumors of border depredations,
committed by "General Black Hawk" and his "British Band," called into immediate action the
patriotism and official power of the Governor. Under date of Bellville, May 26, 1831, he writes
to the superintendent of Indian affairs, General William Clark, at St. Louis, that in order
to protect the citizens of Illinois, which he considered in a state of "actual invasion," he
had called out seven hundred militia to remove a band of Sac Indians, then residing at Rock
river, and he pledges himself to the superintendent, that in fifteen days he will have a force
in the field, sufficient to "remove them dead or alive, over to the west side of the Mississippi."
But to save all this disagreeable business, his Excellency suggests to General Clark that perhaps
a request from him to these Indians, to remove to the west side of the river, would effect
the object of procuring peace to the citizens of the state. The letter concludes with the magnanimous
declaration that there is no disposition on the part of the people of the state of Illinois
to injure these unfortunate, deluded savages, "if they will let us alone."

General Clark, under date of St. Louis, 28 May, 1831, acknowledges the receipt of the above
letter, and says, that he had already made every effort in his power, to get all the Indians
who had ceded their lands to remove.

On the same day, 28th May, 1831, Governor Reynolds writes to General Gaines, then at St. Louis,
that he had received information that Black Hawk and his band had invaded the state of Illinois;
and that he had called out seven hundred troops to meet them. General Gaines, on the 29th of
May, replies to his Excellency that he had ordered six companies of United States troops from
Jefferson Barracks to Rock Island, and that they would be joined by four other companies from
Prairie des Chiens, making in all ten companies; a force which he deemed sufficient to repel
the invasion and give security to the frontier: That if the residue of the Sacs and Foxes,
or other tribes should unite with the band of Black Hawk, he would call on his Excellency for
some militia, but did not then deem it necessary.

On the 30th of May, the troops, accompanied by General Gaines, left Jefferson barracks, in
a steam boat, for Fort Armstrong; and upon the 7th of June, the commanding general held a council
on Rock island, at which Black Hawk and some of his braves were present. Keokuk, Wa-pel-lo
and other chiefs from the west side of the Mississippi were also in attendance. When the council
was opened, General Gaines rose and stated that the President was displeased with the refusal
of the Sacs of Rock river, to go to the right bank of the Mississippi, that their great father
wanted only that which was reasonable and right, and insisted that they should remove. Black
Hawk replied, in substance, that the Sacs had never sold their lands and were determined to
hold on to their village. General Gaines inquired, "who is Black Hawk? Is he a chief? By what
right does he appear in council?"

No reply was made; Black Hawk arose, gathered his blanket around him, and stalked out of the
council room. On the following morning he was again in his seat, and when the council was opened,
he arose and said, "My father, you inquired yesterday, "who is Black Hawk? why does he sit
among the chiefs?" I will tell you who I am. I am a Sac, my father was a Sac--I am a warrior
and so was my father. Ask those young men, who have followed me to battle, and they will tell
you who Black Hawk is--provoke our people to war, and you will learn who Black Hawk is." He
then sat down, and nothing more was said on the subject. The result of this conference was,
that Black Hawk refused to leave his village, and that General Gaines informed him and his
party, if they were not on the West side of the Mississippi within a few days, he should be
compelled to remove them by force. The General anxious, if possible, to effect the object without
bloodshed, deemed it expedient to increase his forces, that the Indians might be intimidated,
and thus induced to submit; or, in case of a resort to hostile measures, that he might be fully
prepared to act with efficiency. He accordingly called upon the Governor of Illinois for some
militia, to co-operate with the United States' troops under his command. On the 25th of June,
Governor Reynolds, and General Joseph Duncan with 1600 mounted militiamen, principally volunteers,
reached Rock river. On the morning of the 26th, General Gaines with his combined forces, took
possession of the Sac village without firing a gun or finding an Indian; the whole party, with
their wives and children, having crossed over the Mississippi the previous night. On the following
day they were found on the west bank of that stream, encamped under the protection of a white flag.

On the 30th of June, General Gaines and Governor Reynolds signed a treaty of capitulation and
peace, with Black Hawk, Pa-she-pa-how, Wee-sheat, Kah-ke-ka-mah, and other chiefs and head
men of the British band of Sac Indians, and their old allies of the Winnebago, Pottawatamie
and Kickapoo nations. The preamble to this treaty is worthy of preservation. It is in these words.

"Whereas, the British Band of Sac Indians, have in violation of the several treaties, entered
into between the United States and the Sac and Fox nations, in the year 1804, 1816 and 1825,
continued to remain upon and to cultivate the lands on Rock river, ceded to the United States
by said treaties, after the said lands had been sold by the United States, to individual citizens
of Illinois and other states: and whereas the said British Band of Sac Indians, in order to
sustain their pretensions to continue upon said Rock river lands, have assumed the attitude
of actual hostility towards the United States, and have had the audacity to drive citizens
of the state of Illinois from their homes, destroy their corn, and invite many of their old
friends of the Pottawatamies, Winnebagoes, and Kickapoos, to unite with them the said British
band of Sacs, in war, to prevent their removal from said lands: and whereas many of the most
disorderly of these several tribes of Indians, did actually join the said British band of Sac
Indians prepared for war against the United States, and more particularly against the state
of Illinois; from which purpose they confess nothing could have restrained them, but the apprehension
of force far exceeding the combined strength of the said British Band of Sac Indians, with
such of their aforesaid allies, as had actually joined them; but, being now convinced that
such a war would tend speedily to annihilate them, they have voluntarily abandoned their hostile
attitude and sued for peace." Therefore, &c.

The first article stipulates that peace is granted by the United States to the British Band
of Sac Indians--the second that they are required to submit to the chiefs of the Sac and Fox
nations, who reside on the west side of the Mississippi--the third that the United States guaranty
to them the integrity of their lands west of that river under the treaties of 1825 and 1830--the
fourth that the said British Band shall not trade with any nation but the United States--that
the United States have a right to establish military posts and roads within their country--the
sixth that the chiefs and head men of the Sac and Fox nations shall enforce the provisions
of this treaty--and finally that permanent peace and friendship be established between the
United States and the said British Band of Sac Indians, and that the latter are not to return
to the east side of the Mississippi without the permission of the former.

The commanding General, under date of sixth of July, 1831, informs the war department, that,
"The mounted volunteers, the regulars, two pieces of artillery, and some musquetry and riflemen,
induced the Indians to abandon the village before our arrival, without firing a gun. Deserted
by their allies, this disorderly band was left alone to seek security in a speedy flight to
the right bank of the Mississippi, where they were found the next day, under the protection
of a white flag." Governor Reynolds in his official despatch to the same department, under
date of Belleville. Ill. 7th July 1831, says:

"The Indians with some exceptions, from Canada to Mexico, along the northern frontier of the
United States, are more hostile to the whites, than at any other period since the last war;
particularly the band of Sac Indians, usually and truly called the "British Band," became extremely
unfriendly to the citizens of Illinois and others. This band had determined for some years
past to remain at all hazards, on certain lands which had been purchased by the United States,
and afterwards some of them sold to private individuals by the general government. They also
determined to drive off the citizens from this disputed territory. In order to effect this
object, they committed various outrages on the persons and property of the citizens of this
state. That this band might the more effectually resist all force that would be employed against
them, they treated with many other tribes to combine together for the purpose of aiding this
British Band to continue in possession of the country in question." General William Clark,
the Indian agent at St. Louis, in his official communication to the department, says, "The
disaffected Sacs were depending for an increase to their number from the discontented parts
of the Kickapoos, Pottawatamies and Winnebagoes," and that they exhibited a daring opposition,
&c. &c.

From the tone and pomposity of these documents, commencing with Governor Reynold's annunciation
to General Clark, that Illinois was in a state of "actual invasion," and ending with the letters
to the war department, just cited, it might appear, to one not familiar with the facts in the
case, that a powerful confederacy of warlike Indians, after years of secret preparation, had
made a sudden and bold descent upon the state of Illinois, and were about to carry war and
desolation throughout the frontiers--to make the heavens lurid with the conflagration of dwelling
houses, and the air resonant with the wails of women and children sinking beneath the murderous
tomahawk: and, that this banded horde of northern savages, had been successfully met, captured
or dispersed, by the patriotism, valor and overwhelming power of the combined army of the United
States and the militia of Illinois! And yet, will it be credited by posterity, that this "actual
invasion" of the state, fierce and appalling as it has been represented, consisted simply in
this: a part of the Sac tribe of Indians, residing within the boundaries of Illinois, at their
village on Rock river, where they were born and had lived all their lives, refused to give
up their corn-fields to some white men, who had purchased the same, under a sale made by the
government of the United States for the purpose of a technical evasion of one of its own treaties.
In short, thus far, it was little more than a neighborhood quarrel between the squaws of the
"British Band" of Indians, and a few white settlers,--most of whom were there in violation
of the laws of the country--about the occupancy of some corn-fields, which, from time immemorial,
had been annually cultivated by the Indian women. Black Hawk became excited by these outrages,
as he deemed them, upon the rights of his people; but instead of killing every white man in
his vicinity, which he could have done in one night, he simply commanded them to leave his
village: and threatened in case they did not, to remove them by force. Such is the substance
of the "actual invasion" of the state of Illinois, by the British Band of Sac Indians. Admitting
these allegations to be true, what may be said in behalf of the party against which they are
made? It may be replied, that under the treaty of 1804, the Indians had an undoubted right
to "live and hunt" upon the land ceded by that treaty, so long as it remained the property
of the United States: that as early as 1823-4 the whites had intruded upon the land on Rock
river around the principal village of the Sacs and Foxes--the United States neglecting to have
these intruders removed, as by the treaty they were solemnly bound to do: that these whites
frequently beat the Indian men, women, and children with sticks, destroyed their corn fields,
distributed whiskey among them, cheated them out of their furs and peltries and on one occasion,
when the Indians were absent on a hunting excursion, set fire to some thirty or forty of their
lodges, by which many of them were totally destroyed.

These outrages were perpetrated before a single acre of the land upon Rock river, had been
sold by the United States, and when in fact, the regular frontier settlements of Illinois,
had not approached within fifty miles of the Sac village. Consequently they were committed
in express violation of the most solemn treaties and of the laws of the United States, for
the protection of the Indians. In 1829, clearly with a view, on the part of those who brought
about the measure, of evading the force of that article of the treaty of 1804, which permitted
the Indians to live and hunt upon these lands, so long as they remained the property of the
United States, a few quarter sections were sold, on Rock river, including the Sac village.
New insults and outrages were now offered to the Indians, and they were again ordered to remove,
not from the quarter sections which had actually been sold, but to the west side of the Mississippi.
Against this, they remonstrated and finally refused, positively, to be driven away. The results
of this refusal have already been shown in the narration which has been made of the events
following upon the "actual invasion" of the state of Illinois, in the spring of 1831. But it
has been said that these Indians endeavored to form an alliance with some of the neighboring
tribes to defend their lands. There is no doubt that Black Hawk labored to persuade Keokuk
and the Sac Indians residing with him, to return to the east side of the Mississippi and assist
in defending their village. His effort to unite with him, in alliance against the United States,
the Winnebagoes, Pottawatamies and Kickapoos, was probably for the same object, though the
case is not so clearly made out. Mr. Schoolcraft in his "Narrative" speaks of a war message
having been transmitted to the Torch lake Indians, by Black Hawk, or his counsellors, in 1830,
and repeated in the two succeeding years; and adds that similar communications were made to
other tribes. The message, continues Mr. Schoolcraft, was very equivocal. It invited these
tribes to aid the Sacs in fighting their enemies. Whatever may have been the object, no success
attended the effort. Other motives than that of retaining possession of these lands, may have
prompted Black Hawk to seek this alliance. Being an ambitious, restless man, he may have thought
it expedient to do something to keep himself in power with his people. A military campaign
is occasionally a fortunate circumstance for a politician, whether his skin be red or white.
Gunpowder-popularity is of equal importance to the chiefs of the Sacs and the chiefs of the
Illini. An "actual invasion" of a state--which, in these modern times, is supposed to consist
in "levelling deadly weapons" at the inhabitants thereof, and "stealing their potatoes," is
quite a wind-fall to political aspirants.

That the British Band of Sac Indians cherished the feeling of active hostility towards the
whites, that has been attributed to them, may well be questioned. That they were provoked to
a feeble assertion of their rights by the injustice of our government and the lawless conduct
of the white settlers among them, is unquestionably true. But it should be recollected, that
from the period of their treaty with the United States, in 1816, to their capitulation in 1831,
they had not killed one of our people. For a number of years prior to 1831, the Americans had
constantly passed through their country, unarmed, carrying with them large amounts of money
and of goods, for the trade at the lead mines: and yet not one of these travellers, sleeping
in the woods and the Indian lodges, had been molested in person or property. For several years,
the whites residing at and around the Sac village on Rock river were trespassing upon these
Indians, for the purpose of driving them to the west side of the Mississippi, but still the
tomahawk was not raised for retaliation. If Black Hawk and his party, had really intended to
resort to arms, who that understands the Indian character, can doubt for a moment, that they
would have struck a decisive blow, and murdered every white settler upon Rock river, before
General Gaines ascended the Mississippi? After our army reached Fort Armstrong and General
Gaines had been informed by Black Hawk that he would not remove, he gave orders to his braves,
that if the American war chief came to the village to force them away, not a gun should be
fired, nor any resistance offered; but that they must remain quietly in their lodges and let
the war chief kill them if he chose. Under these circumstances, it is as difficult to believe
that Black Hawk and his band seriously intended to make war upon the whites at that time, as
it is to admit that the United States had a right to force the Indians to remove to the west
side of the Mississippi, because a few quarter sections of the land at the mouth of Rock river,
had been prematurely sold; while millions of acres around, were still the property of the United
States, and as such, under the treaty of 1804, the Indians were expressly permitted to live
and hunt upon them.

In the course of this narrative, frequent mention has been made of the leading chief of the
Sac nation, who is highly distinguished by his influence, pacific character and fine talents.
The relation he sustains to Black Hawk and his band, connects him directly with our narrative.
On this account, as well as to gratify the interest which is felt in his history, the succeeding
chapter will be occupied with a brief sketch of the life and adventures of Keokuk, the Watchful
Fox.

It is no easy task to present in a satisfactory manner, a biographical sketch of an Indian.
However eventful his life may have been, it is only a few of the more prominent of his deeds
which become known to the world; while the minor incidents, those small matters, which make
up the sum of human character, pass unobserved by his companions, or if noticed, are soon forgotten.
The subject of the present chapter, is yet in the meridian of life, high in power, and in the
enjoyment of a distinguished reputation. Yet the materials for estimating his character, and
for tracing his progress, step by step, from the obscurity of a private station, to the most
honorable post in the nation over which he now presides, are neither full nor satisfactory.
Barely enough is known of him, throughout the United States, to create the desire to know more;
and it is to be regretted that the means of gratifying this laudable curiosity, are not more
abundant.

Keokuk is a native of the Sac nation of Indians, and was born near or upon Rock river in the
north western part of what now constitutes the state of Illinois, about the year 1780. He is
not a hereditary chief, and consequently has risen to his present elevation by the force of
talent and of enterprize. He began to manifest these qualities at a very early period of his
life. While but a youth he performed an act, which placed him, as it were by brevet, in the
ranks of manhood. In the first battle in which he engaged, he encountered and killed a Sioux
warrior, with his spear, while on horseback; and as the Sioux are distinguished for their horsemanship,
this was looked upon as so great an achievement, that a public feast was made in commemoration
of it, by his tribe; and the youthful Keokuk, was forthwith admitted to all the rights and
privileges of a Brave. It was further allowed, that ever afterwards, on all public occasions,
he might appear on horseback, even if the rest of the chiefs and braves were not mounted.

During the late war between the United States and Great Britain, and before Keokuk was entitled
to take his seat in the councils of his nation, an expedition was sent by our government, to
destroy the Indian village at Peoria, on the Illinois river. A rumor reached the Sac village,
in which he resided, that this expedition was also to attack the Sacs, and the whole tribe
was thrown into consternation. The Indians were panic stricken, and the council hastily determined
to abandon their village. Keokuk happened to be standing near the council-lodge when this decision
was made. It was no sooner announced than he boldly advanced to the door and requested admission.
It was granted. He asked leave to speak, and permission was given him. He commenced by saying
he had heard with deep regret, the decision of the council--that he himself was wholly opposed
to flight, before an enemy still distant, and whose strength was entirely unknown. He called
the attention of the council to the importance of meeting the enemy in their approach--of harassing
their progress--cutting them off in detail--of driving them back, or of nobly dying in defence
of their country and their homes.

"Make me your leader," he boldly exclaimed; "let our young men follow me, and the pale-faces
shall be driven back to their towns. Let the old men and the women, and all who are afraid
to meet the white man, stay here, but let your braves go to battle." Such intrepid conduct,
could not fail to produce its effect upon a race so excitable as the Indians. The warriors
with one voice, declared they were ready to follow Keokuk; and he was at once chosen to lead
them against the enemy. It turned out, however, that the alarm was false, but the eloquence
of Keokuk in the council, and his energy in preparing for the expedition, placed him at once
in the first rank of the braves.

His military reputation, was, on another occasion, much increased, by the skill and promptness
with which he met a sudden emergency on the battle field. With a party of his braves, Keokuk
was hunting in the country which lies between the residence of the Sacs and that of the Sioux,
betwixt whom, for many years, a deadly hatred had existed. Very unexpectedly, a party of the
latter well mounted, came upon them. The Sacs were also on horseback, but their enemies being
superior horsemen and fully equipped for war, had a decided advantage. There was no covert
from behind which the Sacs could fight, and flight was impossible. Keokuk's mode of defence
was as novel as ingenious. He instantly formed his men into a compact circle, ordered them
to dismount, and take shelter behind their horses, by which movement they were protected from
the missiles of the Sioux, and at the same time placed under circumstances in which they could
avail themselves of their superiority as marksmen. The Sioux, raising the war-whoop, charged
upon their entrenched foe with great fury, but were received with a fire so destructive that
they were compelled to fall back. The attack was repeated but with the same result. The hordes
could not be forced upon those whose guns were pouring forth vollies of fire and smoke, and
after several unsuccessful attempts to break the line, the Sioux retreated with considerable loss.

At a subsequent period, during a cessation of hostilities between these tribes, the Sacs had
gone to the prairies to hunt buffalo, leaving their village but slightly protected by braves.
During the hunt Keokuk and his band, unexpectedly approached an encampment of a large number
of Sioux, painted for war, and evidently on their way to attack his village. His own braves
were widely scattered over the extensive plains, and could not be speedily gathered together.
Possessing the spirit of a fearless and generous mind, he instantly resolved upon the bold
expedient of throwing himself between the impending danger and his people. Unattended, he deliberately
rode into the camp of his enemy. In the midst of their lodges rose the war-pole, and around
it the Sioux were dancing, and partaking of those fierce excitements, by means of which the
Indians usually prepare themselves for battle. It happened that revenge upon the Sacs constituted
the burden of their songs, at the moment of Keokuk's approach. He dashed into the midst of
them and boldly demanded to see their chief. "I have come," said he, "to let you know that
there are traitors in your camp: they have told me that you are preparing to attack my village:
I know they told me lies, for you could not, after smoking the pipe of peace, be so base as
to murder my women and children in my absence. None but cowards would be guilty of such conduct."
When the first feeling of amazement began to subside, the Sioux crowded around him in a manner
evincing a determination to seize his person, and they had already laid hold of his legs, when
he added, in a loud voice, "I supposed they told me lies, but if what I have heard is true,
then the Sacs are ready for you." With a sudden effort, he dashed aside those who had seized
him, plunged his spurs into his gallant horse, and rode off at full speed. Several guns were
discharged at him, but fortunately without effect: a number of the Sioux warriors instantly
sprung upon their horses and pursued him, but in vain. Keokuk, on horseback, was in his element;
he made the woods resound with the war-whoop, and brandishing his tomahawk in defiance of his
foes, soon left them far behind, and joined his little party of braves. His pursuers, fearful
of some stratagem, gave up the pursuit, after having followed him for some distance, and retired
to their camp. Keokuk took immediate steps to call in his braves and speedily returned to protect
his village. His enemies, however, finding themselves discovered, abandoned the contemplated
attack and retraced their steps to their own country.

The eloquence of Keokuk and his sagacity in the civil affairs of his nation, are, like his
military talents, of a high order. One or two cases in which these have been exhibited, are
worthy of being recorded. A few years since, some of his warriors fell in with a party of unarmed
Menominies, at Prairie des Chiens, in sight of fort Crawford, and murdered the whole of them.
Justly incensed at this outrage, the Menominies prepared to take up arms against the Sacs,
and prevailed upon the Winnebagoes to join them. For the purpose of allaying the rising storm,
the United States' agent, at Prairie des Chiens, General Street, invited the several parties
to a council at that place for the purpose of adjusting the difficulty, without a resort to
arms. They accordingly, out of respect to the agent, assembled at fort Crawford, but the Menominies
refused, sternly, to hold any conference with the Sacs on the subject. Keokuk told the agent
not to be discouraged, for he would adjust the difficulty with them, before they separated,
in despite of their prejudices and their positive refusal to treat: He only asked an opportunity
of meeting them face to face in the council-lodge. The tribes were brought together, but the
Menominies persevered in their determination to hold no conference with the Sacs. The negociation
proceeded, and a friendly feeling was re-established between the Winnebagoes and the Sacs.
Keokuk then rose and with much deliberation, began his address to the Menominies. At first
they averted their faces or listened with looks of defiance. He had commenced his speech without
smoking the pipe or shaking hands, which was a breach of etiquette; and, above all, he was
the chief of a tribe that had inflicted upon them an injury, for which blood alone could atone.
Under these discouraging circumstances, Keokuk proceeded, in his forcible, persuasive and impressive
manner. Such was the touching character of his appeal, such the power of his eloquence, that
the features of his enemies gradually relaxed; they listened; they assented; and when he concluded
by remarking, proudly, but in a conciliating tone, "I came here to say that I am sorry for
the imprudence of my young men; I came to make peace; I now offer you the hand of Keokuk; who
will refuse it?" they rose one by one and accepted the proffered grasp.

In the late contest between the United States and Black Hawk's band, Keokuk and a majority
of the Sacs and Foxes, took no part. Black Hawk made several efforts to induce them to unite
against the whites, which they were strongly inclined to do, not only from their love of war
and of plunder but on account of the injustice with which very many of them believed they had
been treated by the people of the United States. It required all of Keokuk's influence and
moderation to prevent the whole nation from enlisting under the Black Hawk banner. He requested
the agent of the American Government to send to his village, on the west side of the Mississippi,
a white man who understood the Sac language, and who might bear witness to his, Keokuk's sincerity
and faithfulness to the whites. Such a person was sent. The excitement raised by Black Hawk
and the war in which he was engaged, continued to increase among Keokuk's people. "He stood
on a mine, liable to be exploded by a single spark. He was in peril of being slain as the friend
of the whites. He remained calm and unawed, ruling his turbulent little state with mildness
and firmness, but at the constant risk of his life. One day, a new emissary arrived from Black
Hawk's party. Whiskey was introduced into the camp, and Keokuk saw that the crisis was at hand.
He warned the white man who was his guest, of the impending danger, and advised him to conceal
himself. A scene of tumult ensued. The emissary spoke of blood that had been shed--of their
relations being driven from their hunting grounds--of recent insults--of injuries long inflicted
by the whites--hinted at the ready vengeance that might be taken on an exposed frontier--of
defenceless cabins--and of rich booty. The desired effect was produced. The braves began to
dance around the war pole, to paint and to give other evidences of a warlike character. Keokuk
watched the rising storm and appeared to mingle in it. He drank and listened and apparently
assented to all that was said. At length his warriors called out to be led to battle, and he
was asked to lead them. He arose and spoke with that power which had never failed him. He sympathized
in their wrongs--their thirst for vengeance--he won their confidence by giving utterance to
the passions by which they were moved, and echoing back their own thoughts with a master spirit.
He then considered the proposition to go to war, alluded to the power of the whites--the hopelessness
of the contest: He told them he was their chief--that it was his duty to rule them as a father
at home: to lead them to war if they determined to go. But in the proposed war, there was no
middle course: The power of the United States was such, that unless they conquered that great
nation, they must perish; that he would lead them instantly against the whites on one condition,
and that was, that they should first put all their women and children to death, and then resolve,
that having crossed the Mississippi, they would never return, but perish among the graves of
their fathers rather than yield them to the white-men. This proposal, desperate as it was,
presented the true issue: it calmed the disturbed passions of his people, the turmoil subsided,
order was restored, and the authority of Keokuk, became for the time being firmly re-established."[6]

Black Hawk and his band have always been opposed to Keokuk, and since the late war, which proved
so disastrous to them, and into which they were plunged, in opposition to his counsel, they
have looked upon him with increased aversion.

They have made repeated efforts to destroy his influence with the remainder of the tribe, and
owing to the monotony of his pacific rule, were, on one occasion, nearly successful. A spirit
of discontent pervaded his people--they complained of the extent of the power which he wielded--they
needed excitement, and as his measures were all of a peaceful character, they sought it in
a change of rulers. The matter was at length openly and formally discussed. The voice of the
nation was taken, Keokuk was removed from his post of head man and a young chief placed in
his stead. He made not the smallest opposition to this measure of his people, but calmly awaited
the result. When his young successor was chosen, Keokuk was the first to salute him with the
title of Father. But the matter did not rest here. With great courtesy, he begged to accompany
the new chief to the agent of the United States, then at Rock island; and with profound respect,
introduced him as his chief and his father--urged the agent to receive him as such, and solicited,
as a personal favor, that the same regard that had ever been paid to him, by the whites, might
be transferred to his worthy successor. The sequel may be readily inferred. The nation could
not remain blind to the error they had committed. Keokuk as a private individual was still
the first man among his people. His ready and noble acquiescence in their wishes, won both
their sympathy and admiration. He rose rapidly but silently to his former elevated station,
while the young chief sunk as rapidly to his former obscurity.

Some time in 1832, five of the friendly Sacs belonging to Keokuk's party, murdered a man by
the name of Martin, in Warren county, Illinois. One of these, proved to be a nephew of Keokuk,
but by the orders of his uncle, he was seized and delivered over to the civil authority of
that state to be tried for the murder. The other four made their escape. Some time afterwards,
Keokuk was called upon to deliver up the other four Sacs, who had been concerned in the outrage,
that they also might be brought to justice. He replied that they were beyond his reach, but
that he would call a council of his head-men and take measures to give satisfaction to the
whites. The council was held, and Keokuk stated the demand of their Great Father, the President;
and that if satisfaction were not made to him, he feared an army would be sent into their country,
and that many troubles would overtake them. Immediately four young warriors arose and offered
to be surrendered up to the whites, and suffer death in place of the real offenders, to prevent
their nation from incurring the displeasure of the President. Keokuk, supposing that this would
satisfy the demands of justice, delivered them up as the murderers and they were imprisoned.
Upon their trial, Keokuk was present, as a witness. In giving his testimony, he stated with
honest simplicity, that the young men then arraigned in court, for the murder of Martin, were
not the guilty ones, but they had agreed to die in place of the real murderers who could not
be found. The prisoners were, as a matter of course, set at liberty.

Some months after the close of the "Black Hawk war," Keokuk was informed that reports were
in circulation, in the state of Illinois, that the Indians were dissatisfied and preparing
for fresh hostilities. He dictated a letter to the Governor upon the subject, which was forwarded
to him. It is in these words.

                 "Raccoon Fork of Des Moines river, Nov. 30, 1832.
      "To the Great Chief of Illinois.
    "MY FATHER:

"I have been told by a trader, that several of your village criers [editors] have been circulating
bad news, informing the whites that the Indians are preparing for war, and that we are dissatisfied.
My Father, you were present when the tomahawk was buried, and assisted me to place it so deep,
that it will never again be raised against your white children of Illinois.

"My Father, very few of that misguided band that entered Rock river last summer, remain. You
have humbled them by war, and have made them friendly by your generous conduct to them after
they were defeated.

"Myself and the greater part of the Sacs and Foxes, have firmly held you by the hand: We followed
your advice and did as you told us. My Father, take pity on those of my nation that you forgave,
and never mention the disasters of last summer. I wish them to be forgotten.

"I do not permit the criers of our village or camps to proclaim any bad news against the whites,
not even the truth. Last fall an old man, a Fox, was hunting on an island, a short distance
below Rock river for turkeys to carry to Fort Armstrong: he was killed by a white man. My Father,
we passed it over: we have only spoken of it in whispers; our agent has not heard of it. We
wish to live in friendship with the whites; if a white man comes to our camp or village, we
give him a share of what we have to eat, a lodging if he wants it, and put him on the trail
if he has lost it.

"My Father, advise the criers of your villages to tell the truth respecting us, and assist
in strengthening the chain of friendship, that your children may treat us friendly when they
meet us: and be assured that we are friends, and have feelings as well as they have.

  "My Father, this is all I have to say at present.
             "KEOKUK, Chief of the Sac nation."

In the autumn of the year 1837, Keokuk and a party of his warriors made a visit to Washington
city. Black Hawk was of the party, having been taken along, it is supposed by the politic Keokuk,
lest in his absence, the restless spirit of the old man should create some new difficulties
at home. We are indebted to a gentleman[7] who happened to be at the capital at the time of
this visit, for the following sketch of a council, held under the direction of the Secretary
at War, Mr. Poinsett, for the laudable purpose of reconciling the long cherished feeling of
hostility between the Sacs and Foxes, and the Sioux,--a deputation of chiefs from this latter
nation being also at the seat of government. The council was held in a church. The Indians
were seated on a platform erected for the purpose, the spectators occupying the pews. The Secretary,
representing the President, was seated on the center of the platform, facing the audience--the
Sioux on his right hand and the Sauks and Foxes on his left, forming a semi-circle. "These
hostile tribes, presented in their appearance a remarkable contrast. The Sioux tricked out
in blue coats, epaulettes, fur hats and various articles of finery, which had been presented
to them, and which were now incongruously worn in conjunction with portions of their own proper
costume; while the Saukies and Foxes, with a commendable pride and good taste, wore their national
dress, without any admixture, and were studiously painted according to their own notions of
propriety. But the most striking object was Keokuk, who sat at the head of his delegation,
on the extreme left, facing his mortal enemies the Sioux, who occupied the opposite side of
the stage; having the audience upon his left side, and his own people on his right, and beyond
them the Secretary at War. He sat grasping in his right hand the war banner, the symbol of
his station as ruling chief. His person was erect and his eye fixed calmly but steadily upon
the enemies of his people. On the floor, and leaning upon the knee of the chief, sat his son,
a boy of nine or ten years old, whose fragile figure and innocent countenance, afforded a beautiful
contrast with the athletic and warlike form and the intellectual though weather-beaten features
of his father. The effect was in the highest degree picturesque and imposing. The council was
opened by smoking the pipe, which was passed from mouth to mouth. The Secretary then briefly
addressed both parties, in a conciliating strain, urging them, in the name of their great father,
the President, to abandon those sanguinary wars, by means of which their race was becoming
extinct, and to cultivate the arts, the thrift and industry of the white men. The Sioux spoke
next. The orator, on rising first stepped forward, and shook hands with the Secretary, and
then delivered his harangue in his own tongue, stopping at the end of each sentence, until
it was rendered into English by the interpreter, who stood by his side, and into the Saukie
language by the interpreter of that tribe. Another and another followed, all speaking vehemently
and with much acrimony. The burthen of their harangue was, the folly of addressing pacific
language to the Sauks and Foxes, who were faithless and in whom no confidence could be placed.
'My father,' said one of them, 'you cannot make these people hear any good words unless you
bore their ears with sticks.' 'We have often made peace with them,' said another speaker, an
old man, who endeavored to be witty, 'but they would never observe any treaty. I would as soon
think of making a treaty with that child,' pointing to Keokuk's little boy, 'as with a Saukie
or Musquakee.' The Sioux were evidently gratified and excited by the sarcasms of their orators,
while their opponents sat motionless, their dark eyes flashing, but their features as composed
and stolid, as if they did not understand that disparaging language that was used. We remarked
a decided want of gracefulness in all these speakers. Each of them having shaken hands with
the Secretary, who sat facing the audience, stood immediately before and near to him, with
the interpreter at his elbow, both having their backs to the spectators; and in this awkward
position, speaking low and rapidly--but little of what they said could be heard except by the
persons near them. Not so Keokuk. When it came to his turn to speak, he rose deliberately,
advanced to the Secretary, and having saluted him, returned to his place, which being at the
foot of the stage, and on one side of it, his face was not concealed from any of the several
parties present. His interpreter stood beside him. The whole arrangement was judicious, and
though apparently unstudied, shewed the tact of an orator. He stood erect, in an easy, but
martial posture, with his robe thrown over his left shoulder and arm, leaving the right arm
bare, to be used in action. His voice was firm, his enunciation remarkably clear, distinct,
and rapid. Those who have had the gratification of hearing a distinguished senator from South
Carolina, now in Congress, whose rapidity of utterance, concentration of thought and conciseness
of language are alike peculiar to himself, may form some idea of the style of Keokuk, the latter
adding, however, an attention to the graces of attitude and action, to which the former makes
no pretension. He spoke with dignity but great animation, and some of his retorts were excellent.
'They tell you,' said he, 'that our ears must be bored with sticks, but, my Father, you could
not penetrate their thick skulls in that way--it would require hot iron.' 'They say they would
as soon make peace with a child, as with us,--they know better, for when they made war upon
us they found us men.' 'They tell you that peace has often been made, and that we have broken
it. How happens it then that so many of their braves have been slain in our country? I will
tell you--they invaded us; we never invaded them: none of my braves have been killed in their
land. We have their scalps and can tell where we took them.

"As we have given the palm to Keokuk, at this meeting, we must in justice to the Sioux, mention
an eloquent reply, made by one of the same party, on a different day. The Secretary at War,
met the Sioux delegation in council to treat for the purchase of some of their territory. A
certain sum of money being offered them for the land, they demanded a greater price. They were
then told that the Americans were a great people, who would not traffic with them like a trader--that
the President had satisfied himself as to the value of the territory, and offered them the
full price. Big Thunder, a son of the Little Crow, replied that the Sioux were a great nation,
and could not, like a trader, ask a price and then take less: and, then to illustrate the equality
of dignity, between the high contracting parties, he used a figure, which struck us as eminently
beautiful--'the children of our white parent are very many, they possess all the country from
the rising of the sun to noon-day:--the Sioux are very many, the land is all theirs from the
noon-day to the setting sun.'"

After leaving Washington city, Keokuk, attended by his wife and son, four chiefs of the united
Sac and Fox tribes, and several warriors among whom were Black Hawk and his son, proceeded
as far north as Boston, and attracted in all the cities through which they passed great attention.
They were met in Boston, with distinguished honors, being received by governor Everett on behalf
of the state, and the mayor, on behalf of the city. The ceremony of receiving the Indians occurred
on the 30th of October, and no public spectacle in the history of Boston, ever assembled so
great a number of its citizens. Between the hours of ten and twelve, the chiefs held a levee
in Faneuil Hall, for the visits of the ladies, exclusively, an immense concourse of whom, thronged
the old "cradle of liberty" to look upon the stranger guests. At 2 o'clock, P.M. the chiefs
were escorted by the Lancers to the State House, which was filled with ladies, the members
of the legislature, the civil authorities, &c. Governor Everett, first addressed the audience,
by giving them a brief account of the different tribes represented by the Indian chiefs then
present. Then turning to the Indians, he said,

"Chiefs and warriors of the united Sac and Fox tribes, you are welcome to our hall of council.
You have come a far way from your homes in the west to visit your white brethren. We are glad
to take you by the hand. We have heard before of the Sacs and Foxes--our travellers have told
us the names of their great men and chiefs. We are glad to see them with our own eyes.

"We are called the Massachusetts. It is the name of the red men who once lived here. In former
times the red man's wigwam, stood on these fields, and his council fires were kindled on this spot.

"When our fathers came over the great waters, they were a small band. The red man stood on
the rock by the sea side, and looked at them.

"We are now grown great and powerful, but we remember the kindness of the red man to our fathers.

"Brothers, our faces are pale and yours are red, but our hearts are alike. The Great Spirit
has made his children of different complexions, but he loves them all.

"Brothers, you dwell between the Mississippi and the Missouri--they are mighty streams. They
have great arms--one stretches out to the east and the other away west to the Rocky mountains.
But they make one river and they run together into the sea.

"Brothers, we dwell in the east and you in the far west, but we are one family, of many branches
but one head.

"Brothers, as you passed through the hall below, you stopped to look at the great image of
our father Washington. It is a cold stone and cannot speak to you. But our great father Washington
loved his red children, and bade us love them also. He is dead but his words have made a great
print in our hearts, like the step of a strong buffalo on the clay in the prairies.

"My brother, (addressing Keokuk) I perceive by your side your young child sitting in the council
hall with you. May the Great Spirit preserve the life of your son. May he grow up by your side
like the tender sapling by the side of the mighty oak. May you long flourish both together,
and when the mighty oak is fallen in the forest, may the young tree take its place, and spread
out its branches over the tribe.

"Brothers, I make you a short talk, and bid you welcome once more to our council hall."

Keokuk rose first in reply, and shaking hands with the Governor and others near to him, spoke
with fine emphasis and much earnest and graceful gesticulation, holding his staff, which he
frequently shifted from hand to hand.

"Keokuk and his chiefs are very much gratified that they have had the pleasure of shaking hands
with the head man or governor of this great state, and also with all the men that surround him.

"You well say, brother, that the Great Spirit has made both of us, though your color is white
and mine is red; but he made your heart and mine the same. The only difference I find is, he
made you speak one language, and I another. He made the same sky above our heads for both.
He gave us hands to take each other by, and eyes to see each other. I wish to take all present
by the hand,--to shake hands with all my white brethren.

"I am very happy to say, before I die, that I have been in the great house where my fathers
and your fathers used to speak together as we do now. And I hope the Great Spirit is pleased
with this sight; and will long continue to keep friendship between the white and red men. I
hope that now, in this presence, he sees us; and hears our hearts proffer friendship to each
other; and that he will aid us in what we are now engaged in.

"My remarks are short and this is what I say to you. I take my friends all by the hand, and
wish the Great Spirit to give them all a blessing."

Several other chiefs spoke, and after them Black Hawk made a short address. To these several
speeches the governor replied collectively. Presents were then distributed among them by the
governor. Keokuk received a splendid sword and brace of pistols; his son, Musanwont, a handsome
little rifle: The head chiefs received long swords and the others short ones. Black Hawk was
also presented with a brace of pistols and a sword. When this ceremony had ended, the Indians
repaired to the common in front of the capitol, and there, in the presence of some thirty thousand
spectators, exhibited themselves in a war dance, for about half an hour; and from thence returned
to their lodging.

Throughout the whole of his visit in Boston, Keokuk preserved his grave and dignified manners,
winning the respect and admiration of all who had an opportunity of coming in contact with
him. Upon his return to the west, he spent a few hours in Cincinnati, and was visited by a
great number of persons. We had the pleasure of taking him by the hand, and of making some
inquiries in regard to his character, of those who were personally acquainted with him.

In person, Keokuk, is stout, graceful and commanding, with fine features and an intelligent
countenance. His broad expanded chest and muscular limbs, denote activity and physical power;
and he is known to excel in dancing, horsemanship, and all athletic exercises. He has acquired
considerable property, and lives in princely style. He is fond of travelling, and makes frequent
visits of state to the Osages, the Ottaways, the Omahas and the Winnebagoes. On these occasions
he is uniformly mounted on a fine horse, clad in a showy robe wrought by his six wives, equipped
with his rifle, pipe, tomahawk and war-club. He is usually attended in these excursions by
forty or fifty of his young men, well mounted and handsomely dressed. A man precedes the party
to announce his approach to the tribe he is about to honor with a visit; and such is his popularity,
that his reception is generally in a style corresponding with the state in which he moves.
These visits are most frequently made in autumn, and are enlivened by hunting, feasting, dancing,
horse-racing and various athletic games, in all of which Keokuk takes an active part. He moves,
it is supposed, in more savage magnificence, than any other Indian chief upon the continent.

In point of intellect, integrity of character, and the capacity for governing others, he is
supposed to have no superior among the Indians: Bold, courageous, and skilful in war--mild,
firm and politic in peace: He has great enterprize and active impulses, with a freshness and
enthusiasm of feeling, which might readily lead him astray, but for his quick perception of
human character, his uncommon prudence and his calm, sound judgment. At an early period of
his life he became the chief warrior of his tribe, and by his superior talents, eloquence,
and intelligence, really directed the civil affairs of his nation for many years, while they
were nominally conducted in the name of the hereditary peace chief. Such is Keokuk, the Watchful
Fox, who prides himself upon being the friend of the whiteman.

Black Hawk and his band were not long upon the west side of the Mississippi, before new difficulties
arose, calculated to disturb the harmony which it was hoped the treaty of the 30th of June,
had established between them and the United States. The period of their removal to the west
side of the Mississippi, was too late in the season to enable them to plant corn and beans
a second time; and before autumn was over they were without provisions. Some of them, one night,
recrossed the river to steal roasting-ears from their own fields,--to quote the language of
Black Hawk,--and were shot at by the whites, who made loud complaints of this depredation.
They, in turn, were highly exasperated at having been fired upon for attempting to carry off
the corn which they had raised, and which they insisted, belonged to them.

Shortly after this, a party of Foxes, belonging, it is believed, to Black Hawk's band, went
up the Mississippi, to Prairie des Chiens, to avenge the murder of some of their tribe, which
had been committed in the summer of 1830, by a party of the Menominies and Sioux. The Foxes
attacked the camp of the Menominies and killed twenty-eight of them. The authorities at Prairie
des Chiens, made a demand of the murderers, that they might be tried and punished under the
laws of the United States, according to the treaty of 1825. Black Hawk, with other chiefs,
took the ground that the United States had no right to make this demand, and refused to give
them up. Here then was another source of difficulty.

Neapope, a chief of the British band, and second in command to Black Hawk, prior to the removal
of the Indians to the west side of the Mississippi, had started on a visit to Malden, to consult
their British Father in regard to the right to retain their lands on Rock river. He returned
late in the fall, bringing word that in his opinion, the Americans could not take their lands,
unless by purchase; and this purchase, it was contended by Black Hawk had never been made.
Neapope on his way from Malden, called to see the Prophet, who assured him that early the ensuing
spring, not only the British, but the Ottawas, Chippewas, Pottawatomies and Winnebagoes, would
assist them to regain their village and the lands around it. Black Hawk believed, or affected
to believe, this information, and began to make preparations to increase the number of his
braves by recruiting from different villages. He sent a messenger to Keokuk, and to the Fox
tribe, to inform them of the good news he had heard, and to ask their co-operation. Keokuk
had too much sagacity to be imposed upon by tales of either British or Indian assistance, and
sent word to Black Hawk that he was deceived and had better remain quiet. With a view of preventing
further difficulty, he is said to have made application to the agent at St. Louis, that the
chiefs of the Sacs and Foxes might be permitted to visit Washington city, to see the President,
and if possible make a final adjustment of the matter in dispute. Black Hawk alledges he was
anxious to make this visit to his Great Father, and had determined, to submit peaceably to
his counsel, whatever it might be. But the arrangement for the visit, from some cause, was
not perfected, and Black Hawk proceeded with his own plans. He established his head quarters
at the point where Fort Madison formerly stood, on the west side of the Mississippi, and made
another unsuccessful effort to draw into his support some of the braves under Keokuk. Having
assembled his own party he began to ascend the Mississippi--the women and children in canoes
with their provisions, camp equipage and property--his warriors armed and mounted on their
horses. Below Rock island, they were met by the Prophet, who informed them that there was a
great war chief then at Fort Armstrong, with a large body of soldiers. The Prophet stated that
the agent and trader at Rock island, had attempted to dissuade him from joining Black Hawk,
but he had refused to take their advice, because so long as they remained at peace, the Americans
dare not molest them. Having reached the mouth of Rock river, in the early part of April 1832,
the whole party rashly and in violation of the treaty of the previous year, crossed to the
east side of the Mississippi, for the avowed purpose of ascending Rock river, to the territory
of their friends, the Winnebagoes, and raising a crop of corn and beans with them. General
Atkinson with a body of troops was then at Fort Armstrong, having been ordered by government
to that point, for the purpose of preventing a war between the Menomenies and the Foxes, and
demanding the surrender of those Indians who had committed the murders at Fort Crawford. After
Black Hawk and his party had proceeded some distance up Rock river, he was overtaken by an
express from General Atkinson, with an order for him to return and recross the Mississippi,
which he refused to obey, on the ground that the General had no right to make such an order;
the Indians being at peace and on their way to the prophet's village, at his request, to make
corn. Before they had reached this point, they were overtaken by a second express from General
Atkinson, with a threat, that if they did not return, peaceably, he would pursue and force
them back. The Indians replied that they were determined not to be driven back, and equally
so not to make the first attack on the whites. Black Hawk now ascertained that the Winnebagoes,
although willing that he should raise a crop of corn with them, would not join in any hostile
action against the United States. The Pottowatomies manifested the same determination, and
both denied having given the prophet any assurances of co-operation. Black Hawk immediately
came to the conclusion, that if pursued by General Atkinson, he would peaceably return with
his party, and recross the Mississippi. He was encamped at Kish-wa-cokee, and was preparing
to compliment some Pottowatomie chiefs, then on a visit to him, by a dog-feast.

In the mean time the Illinois militia, ordered out by Governor Reynolds, upon his hearing of
this second "invasion," of the state, had formed a junction with the regular troops under General
Atkinson at Rock island, the latter assuming the command of the whole. From this point, the
militia, being generally mounted, proceeded by land to Dixon's ferry on Rock river, about half
way between the mouth of that stream and the encampment of Black Hawk. General Atkinson with
three hundred regulars and three hundred militia ascended Rock river in boats to the same point.
Major Stillman, having under his command a body of two hundred and seventy-five mounted volunteers,
obtained leave of General Whitesides, then in command of the Illinois militia, at Dixon's ferry,
to go out on a scouting expedition. He proceeded up Rock river about thirty miles, to Sycamore
Creek, which empties into that river on the east side. This movement brought him within a few
miles of the camp of Black Hawk and a part of his braves, at the time when the old chief was
engaged in getting up a dog-feast in honour of his Pottowatomie visitors.

It was on the 14th of May, that Black Hawk, while engaged in this ceremony, was informed that
a large number of mounted volunteers, had been seen about eight miles from his camp. "I immediately
started," says he, "three young men, with a white flag, to meet them and conduct them to our
camp, that we might hold a council with them, and descend Rock river again: and directed them
in case the whites had encamped, to return, and I would go and see them. After this party had
started, I sent five young men to see what might take place. The first party went to the encampment
of the whites, and were taken prisoners. The last party had not proceeded far, before they
saw about twenty men coming towards them in full gallop. They stopped and finding that the
whites were coming so fast, in a warlike attitude, they turned and retreated, but were pursued
and overtaken and two of them killed. The others made their escape. When they came in with
the news, I was preparing my flags to meet the war chief. The alarm was given. Nearly all my
young men were absent about ten miles off. I started with what I had left, (about forty,) and
had proceeded but a short distance, before we saw a part of the army approaching. I raised
a yell, and said to my braves; "some of our people have been killed, wantonly and cruelly murdered!
we must avenge their death." In a little while we discovered the whole army coming towards
us in full gallop! We were now confident that our first party had been killed. I immediately
placed my men in front of some bushes, that we might have the first fire, when they approached
close enough. They made a halt some distance from us. I gave another yell, and ordered my brave
warriors to charge upon them, expecting that we would all be killed! they did charge--every
man rushed and fired, and the enemy retreated in the utmost confusion, and consternation; before
my little but brave band of warriors. After pursuing the enemy for some distance, I found it
useless to follow them, as they rode so fast, and returned to my encampment with a few of my
braves, (about twenty-five having gone in pursuit of the enemy.) I lighted my pipe, and sat
down to thank the Great Spirit for what he had done. I had not been long meditating, when two
of the three young men I had sent out with the flag, to meet the American war chief, entered.
My astonishment was not greater than my joy to see them living and well. I eagerly listened
to their story, which was as follows:

"When we arrived near to the encampment of the whites, a number of them rushed out to meet
us, bringing their guns with them. They took us into the camp, when an American who spoke the
Sac language a little, told us that his chief wanted to know how we were, where we were going,
where our camp was, and where Black Hawk was. We told him that we had come to see his chief:
that our chief had directed us to conduct him to our camp, in case he had not encamped; and
in that event to tell him, that he (Black Hawk) would come to see him; he wished to hold a
council with him, as he had given up all intention of going to war. At the conclusion of this
talk, a party of white men came in on horseback. We saw by their countenances that something
had happened. A general tumult arose. They looked at us with indignation--talked among themselves
for a moment, when several cocked their guns; in a second they fired at us in the crowd; our
companion fell dead. We rushed through the crowd and made our escape. We remained in ambush
but a short time, before we heard yelling, like Indians running an enemy. In a little while
we saw some of the whites in full speed. One of them came near us. I threw my tomahawk and
struck him on the head, which brought him to the ground. I ran to him and with his own knife
took off his scalp. I took his gun, mounted his horse, and took my friend here behind me. We
turned to follow our braves, who were running the enemy, and had not gone far before we overtook
a white man, whose horse had mired in a swamp. My friend alighted and tomahawked the man, who
was apparently fast under his horse. He took his scalp, horse and gun. By this time our party
was some distance ahead. We followed on and saw several white men lying dead on the way. After
riding about six miles, we met our party returning. We asked them how many of our men had been
killed. They said none after the Americans had retreated. We inquired then how many whites
had been killed? They replied they did not know; but said we will soon ascertain, as we must
scalp them as we go back. On our return we found ten men, besides the two we had killed before
we joined our friends. Seeing that they did not yet recognize us, it being dark, we again asked,
how many of our braves had been killed? They said five. We asked who they were. They replied
that the first party of three, who went out to meet the American war chief, had all been taken
prisoners, and killed in the encampment; and that out of a party of five who followed to see
the meeting of the first party and the whites, two had been killed. We were now certain that
they did not recognize us, nor did we tell them who we were, until we arrived at our camp.
The news of our death had reached it some time before, and all were surprised to see us again."[8]

Such is the narrative of this defeat, as given by Black Hawk, and two of his men who were the
bearers of his white flag and a proposition to surrender. The accounts given by Major Stillman's
troops--for it is not ascertained that the commander published any official statement of the
battle--is in substance about the following. The force under Major Stillman, two hundred and
seventy-five in number, on the afternoon of the fourteenth of May, met three Indians bearing
a white flag, one of whom, after having been taken prisoner, was shot down. The army encamped
just before sunset, in a piece of woods, surrounded by an open prairie, about three miles from
Sycamore creek. Soon after they had halted, five more Indians, with apparent pacific intentions,
were seen approaching the camp. Captain Eades, with a party of armed troops, dashed at full
speed towards them, when they became alarmed and commenced a retreat. The Captain, after following
them for some distance, and killing two of the party, gave up the pursuit, and was on his return
to the camp, when he was met by the whole detachment. The pursuit of the retreating Indians
was immediately renewed, and continued until both parties had crossed Sycamore creek. This
brought them upon the camp of Black Hawk, who having been apprized of the approach of the whites,
had mounted his men and prepared for action. The Indians were concealed behind some bushes,
and after having fired their guns, raised the war-whoop and resorted to the tomahawk. Their
fire was returned, with but little effect, and then Major Stillman, instantly ordered a retreat
across the creek, and the route became general. His troops fled through their camp, and did
not stop until they reached Dixon's ferry, distant thirty miles. Some of them deemed it prudent
to seek a place of still greater safety, than the flag of General Atkinson, and continued their
flight for more than fifty miles, and until they reached their own fire-sides. The roll was
called at Dixon's ferry next morning, and fifty-two were found missing. It was, however, subsequently
ascertained that more than half of this number were among those who rode express to the "settlements"
to carry the news of their gallant attack upon General Black Hawk and his British band. Such
was the panic among the troops engaged in this skirmish, that they reported the Indian force
at 1500 and even 2000 men! Black Hawk's statement has already been given, in which he places
his number at forty; and one of the volunteers whose horse was lame, and who hid himself, and
watched the Indians as they passed him in the pursuit and on their return, did not estimate
them at more than a hundred. It is probable the real number of the Indians did not exceed fifty.
It is painful to contemplate this whole affair, for it is alike discreditable to the national
faith and the national arms. The violation of a flag of truce, and the wanton destruction of
the lives of some of those who bore it, not only placed an indelible stigma upon the character
of the country, but led to a war, in the prosecution of which, much blood and much treasure
were expended. Had a conference with Black Hawk been held, scarcely a doubt remains, considering
his failure to secure the co-operation of other tribes, and his utter destitution of provisions,
that he and his band would have returned, peaceably, to the west side of the Mississippi. The
precipitate flight of the troops under Major Stillman, has no justification. Supposing the
panic to have been such as to render a retreat across Sycamore creek necessary, it should have
terminated when the troops reached their encampment; which, being in a copse of woods, surrounded
by a prairie, they would have been protected by trees, while the Indians, if they continued
the attack, must have fought in the open plain. But no effort was made to rally at the encampment,
and all the baggage of our troops--blankets, saddle-bags, camp equipage and provisions,--fell
into the hands of the Indians. Black Hawk finding that there was now no alternative, determined
to fight. Indignant at the attack upon his flag of peace--encouraged by his signal success
in putting to flight, a force vastly superior in numbers to his own--and strengthened by the
booty--especially the provisions--he had taken, he assembled his braves and prepared for an
active border war. He immediately sent out spies to watch the movements of General Atkinson,
and prepared to remove his women and children, from the seat of war to the head waters of Rock
river, where he supposed they would be safe from the attacks of the whites. In passing to this
point, by the sources of the Kish-wa-co-kee, he was met by some Winnebagoes, who had heard
of his victory, and were now disposed to join him. Some additional war parties were sent out,
the new recruits from the Winnebagoes, constituting one of them. This arrangement completed,
Black Hawk proceeded with the women and children to the Four Lakes, in which Catfish, one of
the tributaries to Rock river, has its origin.

Stillman's defeat spread consternation throughout the state of Illinois. The Indian forces
were greatly magnified in number, and Black Hawk's name carried with it associations of uncommon
military talent, and of savage cunning and cruelty. General Atkinson proceeded to fortify his
camp, at Dixon's ferry, and the Executive of the state made a call for more mounted volunteers.
The Secretary at War sent about 1000 United States' troops from the sea-board to the scene
of action; and General Winfield Scott was ordered to proceed to the north west, and direct
the future operations of the campaign. A bloody border contest ensued. Many frontier families
were massacred with savage ferocity, and some were carried into captivity. A party of Pottowattomies,
thirty in number, fell upon a little settlement on Indian creek, one of the tributaries of
Fox river, and murdered fifteen men, women and children, taking two prisoners, the Misses Hall;
who were subsequently placed in charge of some Winnebagoes, and by them returned in safety,
a few weeks afterwards, to their friends. At Kellog's grove, not far from Galena, in the early
part of June, a party of Indians stole some horses. Captain J. W. Stephenson pursued them with
twelve men. A skirmish ensued, which resulted in the death of three of our troops and five
or six of the enemy. On the evening of the 14th of June, a party of eleven Sacs, killed five
white men at Spafford's farm. General Dodge with twenty-nine men, followed and overtook them
in a swamp, where the whole were shot down and scalped, they having first killed three of Dodge's
men. The barbarous practice of scalping the dead, was in this case adopted by our troops and
sanctioned by their officers.[9]

On the 24th of June, the Indians made an attack upon the fort at Buffalo grove, twelve miles
north of Dixon's ferry. It was defended by a hundred and fifty men, under the command of Captain
Dement, some of whom, with about forty horses, were killed. The commander did not deem it prudent
to march out and encounter the Indians, who finding that they could not take the fort, secured
a quantity of provisions, some horses and cattle, and commenced a retreat. They had not proceeded
far, before they were overtaken by a detachment of volunteers under Colonel Posey, who had
come to relieve the fort. Black Hawk, who commanded the Indians in this affair, says, "We concealed
ourselves until they came near enough, and then commenced yelling and firing and made a rush
upon them. About this time their chief, with a party of men, rushed up to the rescue of those
we had fired upon. In a little while they commenced retreating, and left their chief and a
few braves, who seemed willing and anxious to fight. They acted like braves, but were forced
to give way when I rushed upon them with my braves. In a short time, the chief returned with
a larger party. He seemed determined to fight and anxious for battle. When he came near enough,
I raised the yell, and firing commenced from both sides. The chief, who is a small man, addressed
his warriors in a loud voice; but they soon retreated, leaving him and a few braves on the
battle field. A great number of my warriors pursued the retreating party, and killed a number
of their horses as they ran. The chief and his braves were unwilling to leave the field. I
ordered my braves to rush upon them, and had the mortification of seeing two of my chiefs killed,
before the enemy retreated. This young chief deserves great praise for his courage, but fortunately
for us, his army was not all composed of such brave men."

The Indians had about two hundred men in this engagement. The troops in the fort united with
those under Colonel Posey, exceeded, in number Black Hawk's party. The loss of life was inconsiderable
on either side.

On the 4th of July, the main army under General Atkinson, arrived at the foot of lake Coshconong,
formed by an expansion of Rock river, in the vicinity of which the Indians had been embodied.
On the 9th of July, General Atkinson says, in a letter to General Scott, that he had not yet
been enabled to find the Indians, who he supposes to be seven or eight hundred strong, his
own force amounting to four hundred regulars and 2100 mounted volunteers.

Two brigades of the mounted volunteers, under General Dodge, pursued the Indians from this
place towards Fort Winnebago. They were overtaken on the 21st of July, about sun down, on the
banks of the Wisconsin. An attack was immediately made, and about forty of the Indians are
supposed to have been killed. General Dodge lost one man and had eight wounded. The exact loss
of the Indians in this engagement cannot be ascertained. One account places the number at sixteen.[10]
Black Hawk says he had but fifty warriors with him in the engagement, the rest being engaged
in assisting the women and children in crossing the Wisconsin to an island, to protect them
from the fury of the whites: That he was compelled to fall back into a deep ravine where he
continued to maintain his ground until dark, and until his people had had time to reach the
island, and that he lost but six of his men. This is undoubtedly a mistake, owing in all probability
to the interpreter in taking down his statement; for some of his men, subsequently, placed
the number at sixty. The condition of the Indians at this time was most deplorable. Before
breaking up their encampment, upon the Four Lakes, they were almost destitute of provisions.
In pursuing their trail from this point to the Wisconsin, many were found literally starved
to death. They were compelled to live upon roots, the bark of trees and horse flesh. A party
of Black Hawk's band, including many women and children, now attempted to descend the Wisconsin
upon rafts and in canoes, that they might escape, by recrossing the Mississippi. They were
attacked however, in their descent, by troops stationed on the bank of the river, and some
were killed, others drowned, a few taken prisoners, and the remainder, escaping to the woods,
perished from hunger. Black Hawk, and such of his party as had not the means of descending
the Wisconsin, having abandoned all idea of any farther resistance, and unwilling to trust
themselves to a capitulation, now determined to strike across the country, and reach the Mississippi,
some distance above the mouth of the former stream, and thus effect their escape. They struck
it at a point opposite the Ioway, and about forty miles above the Wisconsin, losing on their
route, many of their people from starvation. So soon as they reached the Mississippi, a part
of the women and children, in such canoes as they could procure, undertook to descend it, to
Prairie des Chiens, but many of them were drowned before they reached that place, and those
who did arrive at it, were found to be in a starving condition. On the first of August, while
in the act of crossing the Mississippi, an attack was made upon Black Hawk and his party by
the steam boat Warrior, with an armed force on board. The commander of the boat, under date
of Prairie des Chiens, 3d August 1832, gives the following account of it.

"I arrived at this place on monday last, (July 30th) and was despatched with the Warrior alone,
to Wapeshaws village, one hundred and twenty miles above, to inform them of the approach of
the Sacs, and to order down all the friendly Indians to this place. On our way down we met
one of the Sioux band, who informed us that the Indians, our enemies, were on Bad-axe river,
to the number of four hundred. We stopped and cut some wood and prepared for action. About
four o'clock on wednesday afternoon (August 1st) we found the gentlemen [Indians] where he
stated he left them. As we neared them, they raised a white flag, and endeavored to decoy us;
but we were a little too old for them; for instead of landing, we ordered them to send a boat
on board, which they declined. After about fifteen minutes delay, giving them time to remove
a few of their women and children, we let slip a six-pounder, loaded with canister, followed
by a severe fire of musketry; and if ever you saw straight blankets, you would have seen them
there. I fought them at anchor most of the time and we were all very much exposed. I have a
ball which came in close by where I was standing, and passed through the bulkhead of the wheel
room. We fought them for about an hour or more until our wood began to fail, and night coming
on, we left and went on to the prairie. This little fight cost them twenty-three killed, and
of course a great many wounded. We never lost a man, and had but one man wounded, (shot through
the leg.) The next morning before we could get back again, on account of a heavy fog, they
had the whole [of General Atkinson's] army upon them. We found them at it, walked in, and took
a hand ourselves. The first shot from the Warrior laid out three. I can hardly tell you any
thing about it, for I am in great haste, as I am now on my way to the field again. The army
lost eight or nine killed, and seventeen wounded, whom we brought down. One died on deck last
night. We brought down thirty-six prisoners, women and children. I tell you what, Sam, there
is no fun in fighting Indians, particularly at this season, when the grass is so very bright.
Every man, and even my cabin-boy, fought well. We had sixteen regulars, five rifle men, and
twenty of ourselves. Mr. How, of Platt, Mr. James G. Soulard, and one of the Rolettes, were
with us and fought well."

The flippant and vaunting style of this letter is in good keeping with the spirit which prompted
the firing upon a flag of truce. By what circumstance the commander of the Warrior ascertained
that this white flag was intended as a decoy, is left wholly unexplained. As he and his men,
were beyond the reach of the Indians, humanity and the rules of war, required that he should
have allowed himself more than fifteen minutes, to ascertain the true object of the Indians,
in raising the symbol of a capitulation. Black Hawk himself, asserts that he directed his braves
not to fire upon the Warrior, as he intended going on board in order to save the women and
children; that he raised a white flag and called to the captain of the boat, desiring him to
send his canoe on shore, that he might go on board, as he wanted to give himself up. The deplorable
condition to which Black Hawk was at this time reduced, flying for safety to the west side
of the Mississippi, encumbered by his women and children, and his whole party exhausted by
fatigue and hunger, renders it extremely difficult to believe that any decoy was intended by
him. Indeed, nothing can be more certain, than that he was most heartily desirous of ending
the disastrous and fatal contest in which he had become involved, without the slaughter of
any more of his people. If the thirst for blood had been less rapacious on the part of the
Americans, or their respect for a flag of truce something greater, the further destruction
of life would have been spared; and the nation preserved from the charge of having fired upon
a flag, held sacred throughout the world.

After the battle upon the Wisconsin, the whole army, under the command of General Atkinson,
crossed to the north side of that river, at Helena, and on the twenty-ninth of July, commenced
the pursuit of the Indians, by forced marches, over a rugged and mountainous country. On the
morning of the second of August, while ten miles from the Mississippi, it was ascertained that
the enemy were upon the bank of that stream, near the Bad-axe, and in the act of crossing to
the west side. Arrangements were immediately made for an attack. Gen. Dodge's squadron was
placed in front, followed by the infantry, and these by the brigades of Henry, Alexander, and
Posey. The army had proceeded in this order about five miles, when some Indians were discovered
and fired upon. They immediately retreated to the main body, on the bank of the river. To prevent
the possibility of the escape of the enemy, Generals Alexander and Posey, were directed to
form the right wing of the army, and march to the river, above the Indian encampment, and then
to move down along the bank. General Henry formed the left wing, and the United States' infantry
and General Dodge's squadron, occupied the centre. In this order, the army descended a bluff
bank into a river bottom, heavily timbered, and covered with weeds and brush-wood. General
Henry first came upon a portion of the enemy, and commenced a heavy fire upon them, which was
returned. General Dodge's squadron and the United States' troops, soon came into the action,
and with General Henry's men, rushed upon the Indians, killing all in the way, except a few
who succeeded in swimming a slough of the Mississippi, about a hundred and fifty yards wide.
During this time the brigades of Alexander and Posey, in marching down the bank of the river,
fell in with another party of Indians, and killed or routed the whole of them. When the Indians
were driven to the brink of the river, a large number of men, women and children, plunged into
the water to save themselves by swimming; but only a few escaped "our sharpshooters." The battle
lasted about three hours. In the afternoon, of the same day, Generals Atkinson, Dodge and Posey,
descended the Mississippi, to Prairie des Chiens, in the Warrior, and there awaited the arrival
of the mounted volunteers, who reached that place on the fourth. Among the Indians who escaped
the slaughter was Black Hawk. Twelve of those who effected their escape, were captured on the
fourth, by a party of whites, from Cassville, under the command of Captain Price, and most
of those who succeeded in reaching the west side of the Mississippi, were subsequently attacked
by a party of hostile Sioux, and either killed or taken prisoners. The brief, but official
account of this battle is given by the commanding general, in these words.

  Head Quarters, First Artillery Corps, North-western Army
                    Prairie des Chiens, Augt. 25, 1832.

SIR: I have the honor to report to you that I crossed the Ouisconsin on the 27th and 28th ultimo,
with a select body of troops, consisting of the regulars under Col. Taylor, four hundred in
number, part of Henry's, Posey's and Alexander's brigades, amounting in all to 1300 men, and
immediately fell upon the trail of the enemy, and pursued it by a forced march, through a mountainous
and difficult country, till the morning of the 2d inst., when we came up with his main body
on the left bank of the Mississippi, nearly opposite the mouth of the Ioway, which we attacked,
defeated and dispersed, with a loss on his part of about a hundred and fifty men killed, thirty-nine
women and children taken prisoners--the precise number could not be ascertained, as the greater
portion was slain after being forced into the river. Our loss in killed and wounded, which
is stated below, is very small in comparison with the enemy, which may be attributed to the
enemy's being forced from his positions by a rapid charge at the commencement, and throughout
the engagement--the remnant of the enemy, cut up and disheartened, crossed to the opposite
side of the river, and has fled into the interior, with a view, it is supposed, of joining
Keokuk and Wapello's bands of Sacs and Foxes.

The horses of the volunteer troops being exhausted by long marches, and the regular troops
without shoes, it was not thought advisable to continue the pursuit; indeed a stop to the further
effusion of blood seemed to be called for, till it might be ascertained if the enemy would
surrender.

It is ascertained from our prisoners, that the enemy lost in the battle of the Ouisconsin sixty-eight
killed and a very large number wounded; his whole loss does not fall short of three hundred;--after
the battle on the Ouisconsin, those of the enemy's women and children, and some who were dismounted,
attempted to make their escape by descending that river, but judicious measures being taken
by Captain Loomis and Lieut. Street, Indian agent, thirty-two women and children and four men
have been captured, and some fifteen men killed by the detachment under Lieut. Ritner.

The day after the battle on this river, I fell down with the regular troops to this place by
water, and the mounted men will join us to-day. It is now my purpose to direct Keokuk, to demand
a surrender of the remaining principal men of the hostile party, which, from the large number
of women and children we hold prisoners, I have every reason to believe will be complied with.
Should it not, they should be pursued and subdued, a step Maj. Gen. Scott will take upon his
arrival.

I cannot speak too highly of the brave conduct of the regular and volunteer forces engaged
in the last battle and the fatiguing march that preceded it, as soon as the reports of officers
of the brigades and corps are handed in, they shall be submitted with further remarks.

  5 killed, 2 wounded, 6th inft.

The destruction of life in the battle of the Bad-axe, was not confined to the Indian warriors.
Little discrimination seems to have been made between the slaughter of those in arms and the
rest of the tribe. After they had sought refuge in the waters of the Mississippi, and the women,
with their children on their backs, were buffeting the waves, in an attempt to swim to the
opposite shore, numbers of them were shot by our troops. Many painful pictures might be recorded
of the adventures and horrors of that day. One or two cases may be cited. A Sac woman, named
Na-ni-sa, the sister of a warrior of some note among the Indians, found herself in the hottest
of the fight. She succeeded at length in reaching the river, and keeping her infant child,
close in its blanket, by force of her teeth, plunged into the water, seized hold upon the tail
of a horse, whose rider was swimming him to the opposite shore, and was carried safely across
the Mississippi. When our troops charged upon the Indians, in their defiles near the river,
men, women and children were so huddled together, that the slaughter fell alike upon all of
them. A young squaw was standing in the grass, a short distance from the American line, holding
her child, a little girl of four years old, in her arms. In this position, a ball struck the
right arm of the child, just above the elbow, and shattering the bone, passed into the breast
of its young mother, and instantly killed her. She fell upon the child and confined it to the
ground. When the battle was nearly over, and the Indians had been driven from this point, Lieutenant
Anderson of the United States army, hearing the cries of the child, went to the spot, and taking
it from under the dead mother, carried it to the place for surgical aid. The arm was amputated,
and during the operation, the half starved child did not cry, but sat quietly eating a piece
of hard biscuit. It was sent to Prairie des Chiens, and entirely recovered from its wound.

When the fortunes of Black Hawk became desperate, his few straggling allies, from other tribes,
not only deserted him, but joined his enemies. It is to two Winnebagoes, Decorie, and Chaetar,
that the fallen chief is indebted for being taken captive. On the 27th of August, they delivered
Black Hawk and the Prophet to the Indian agent, General Street, at Prairie des Chiens. Upon
their delivery, Decorie, the One-eyed, rose and said:

"My father, I now stand before you. When we parted, I told you I would return soon; but I could
not come any sooner. We have had to go a great distance [to the Dalle, on the Wisconsin, above
the portage.] You see we have done what you sent us to do. These, (pointing to the prisoners)
are the two you told us to get. We have done what you told us to do. We always do what you
tell us, because we know it is for our good. Father, you told us to get these men, and it would
be the cause of much good to the Winnebagoes. We have brought them, but it has been very hard
for us to do so. That one, Black Hawk was a great way off. You told us to bring them to you
alive: we have done so. If you had told us to bring their heads alone, we would have done so,
and it would have been less difficult than what we have done. Father, we deliver these men
into your hands. We would not deliver them even to our brother, the chief of the warriors,
but to you; because we know you, and we believe you are our friend. We want you to keep them
safe; if they are to be hurt we do not wish to see it. Wait until we are gone before it is
done. Father, many little birds have been flying about our ears of late, and we thought they
whispered to us that there was evil intended for us; but now we hope these evil birds will
let our ears alone. We know you are our friend, because you take our part, and that is the
reason we do what you tell us to do. You say you love your red children: we think we love you
as much if not more than you love us. We have confidence in you and you may rely on us. We
have been promised a great deal if we would take these men--that it would do much good to our
people. We now hope to see what will be done for us. We have come in haste; we are tired and
hungry. We now put these men into your hands. We have done all that you told us to do."

The agent, General Street, replied: "My children, you have done well. I told you to bring these
men to me, and you have done so. I am pleased at what you have done. It is for your good, and
for this reason I am pleased. I assured the great chief of the warriors, (General Atkinson)
that if these men were in your country, you would find them and bring them to me, and now I
can say much for your good. I will go down to Rock island with the prisoners, and I wish you
who have brought these men, especially, to go with me, with such other chiefs and warriors
as you may select. My children, the great chief of the warriors, when he left this place, directed
me to deliver these and all other prisoners, to the chief of the warriors at this place, Col.
Taylor, who is here by me. Some of the Winnebagoes, south of the Wisconsin, have befriended
the Saukies, and some of the Indians of my agency have also given them aid. This displeases
the great chief of the warriors, and your great father the President, and was calculated to
do much harm. Your great father, the President at Washington, has sent a great war chief from
the far east, General Scott, with a fresh army of soldiers. He is now at Rock Island. Your
great father the President has sent him and the Governor and chief of Illinois to hold a council
with the Indians. He has sent a speech to you, and wishes the chiefs and warriors of the Winnebagoes
to go to Rock Island, to the council on the tenth of next month. I wish you to be ready in
three days, when I will go with you. I am well pleased that you have taken the Black Hawk,
the Prophet and other prisoners. This will enable me to say much for you to the great chief
of the warriors, and to the president your great father. My children, I shall now deliver the
two men, Black Hawk and the prophet, to the chief of the warriors here. He will take care of
them till we start to Rock Island."

Col. Taylor upon taking charge of the prisoners made a few remarks to their captors, after
which Chaetar, the associate of Decorie, rose and said,

"My father, I am young, and do not know how to make speeches. This is the second time I ever
spoke to you before people. I am no chief; I am no orator; but I have been allowed to speak
to you. If I should not speak as well as others, still you must listen to me. Father, when
you made the speech to the chiefs, Waugh Kon Decorie Carramani, the one-eyed Decorie, and others,
I was there. I heard you. I thought what you said to them, you also said to me. You said if
these two, (pointing to Black Hawk and the prophet) were taken by us and brought to you, there
would never more a black cloud hang over your Winnebagoes. Your words entered into my ear,
my brains and my heart. I left here that same night, and you know that you have not seen me
since until now. I have been a great way; I had much trouble; but when I remembered what you
said, I knew what you said was right. This made me continue and do what you told me to do.
Near the Dalle on the Wisconsin, I took Black Hawk. No one did it but me. I say this in the
ears of all present, and they know it--and I now appeal to the Great Spirit, our grandfather,
and the Earth, our grandmother, for the truth of what I say. Father, I am no chief, but what
I have done is for the benefit of my nation, and I hope to see the good that has been promised
us. That one, Wabokieshiek, the prophet, is my relation--if he is to be hurt, I do not wish
to see it. Father, soldiers sometimes stick the ends of their guns into the backs of Indian
prisoners, when they are going about in the hands of the guard. I hope this will not be done
to this man."

Naopope the second in command, with a few other Indians who escaped from the battle of the
Bad-Axe, were also brought in by the Sioux, who being the ancient enemy of the Sacs and Foxes,
seized upon this opportunity of waging war upon the remnant of Black Hawk's band. They were
placed by General Street, in the custody of Colonel Taylor.

On the seventh of September, the prisoners were placed on board the steam boat Winnebago, and
sent down to Jefferson Barracks, a few miles below St. Louis. The arrival of General Scott
at the scene of action, was unfortunately delayed until after the campaign was closed, in consequence
of the Asiatic cholera having broken out, among the troops under his command, while ascending
the lakes. The disease continued to rage among them, with dreadful mortality, for some time
after their arrival at Rock island. Of course, this campaign added no new laurels to the military
reputation of General Scott; but, by his humane and tireless exertions for the alleviation
of the sufferings of his soldiers, he won for himself more true glory, than the most brilliant
victory, over an Indian enemy, could confer.

While at Rock Island, General Scott instituted some inquiries among the Indians, in regard
to the difficulties between them and the whites. Among others interrogated was Naopope, the
friend and counsellor of Black Hawk, who participated in the campaign, and on account of his
courage and skill as a warrior, directed to a great extent, the movements of the band, from
the period of their recrossing the Mississippi, until the battle of the Bad-Axe. His statement
confirms the declaration of Black Hawk, that in coming over to the east side of the river,
there was no intention of making war upon the frontier settlers; and that they really intended
to surrender to Major Stillman, upon Sycamore creek, on the 14th of May, and actually sent
a white flag, in evidence of their submission, which was fired upon by the American troops.

"I always belonged to Black Hawk's band. Last summer I went to Malden; when I came back, I
found that by the treaty with General Gaines, the Sacs had moved across the Mississippi. I
remained during the winter with the Prophet, on Rock river, thirty-five miles above the mouth.
During the winter the Prophet sent me across the Mississippi, to Black Hawk, with a message,
to tell him and his band to cross back to his village and make corn: that if the Americans
came and told them to remove again, they would shake hands with them. If the Americans had
come and told us to move, we should have shaken hands, and immediately have moved peaceably.
We encamped on Sycamore creek. We met some Pottowatomies and made a feast for them. At that
time I heard there were some Americans [under Maj. Stillman] near us. I prepared a white flag
to go and see them, and sent two or three young men on a hill to see what they were doing.
Before the feast was finished, I heard my young men were killed. This was at sunset. Some of
my young men ran out; two killed, and the Americans were seen rushing on to our camp. My young
men fired a few guns, and the Americans ran off, and my young men chased them about six miles."

Naopope further stated that the Pottowatomies immediately left them, and that none of the Kickapoos
ever joined them. A few of the Winnebagoes did, and brought in scalps at different times; but
so soon as they discovered that the whites were too powerful for the Sacks, they turned round
and fought against them. Some of the other witnesses examined on this occasion, testify, that
when Black Hawk saw the steam boat Warrior approaching them, on the first of August, he said
he pitied the women and children; and, having determined to surrender to the commander of the
boat, raised a white flag which was immediately fired upon. This fact is stated in the letter
of the Captain of the Warrior, and is corroborated by Lieutenant Kingsbury, who had charge
of the troops on board.

Among the prisoners delivered to General Street, was the prophet Wabokieshiek, or the White
Cloud, a stout, shrewd looking Indian about forty years of age. This individual exercised considerable
influence over Black Hawk and his band. He had a village, called after him, upon Rock river,
where he usually resided, and was recognized among the village chiefs. He claimed to be part
Winnebago and part Sac, his father belonging to one and his mother to the other of these tribes.
He wore a full suit of hair, with a white head-dress rising several inches above the top of
his hair--a style of dress suited, it is supposed, to his profession. He seems to have had
sagacity and cunning--two qualities essential to the character of a prophet, and without which
they could not long retain their influence and sacred character. Wabokieshiek has been represented
as the priest of assassination, but the evidence on which this charge is made, seems to be
wanting. He was instrumental in persuading Black Hawk and his party to return to the east side
of the Mississippi in 1832, and went down to the mouth of Rock river to meet them, and encourage
the belief that the Americans would not interfere with them, so long as they refrained from
any offensive operations. He made a speech to the braves and warriors of Black Hawk, in which
he told them they had nothing to fear and much to gain: That the American war chief, would
not molest them so long as they acted peaceably: That the time would come when they would be
ready to pursue a different course; but that they must await such reinforcements as would enable
them to resist the army of the whites. The Prophet was either duped himself, or playing upon
the credulity of Black Hawk and Naopope. He was constantly giving them assurances of assistance
from the other tribes and from their British Father at Malden. There may have been reason for
expecting it from the former, but none from the latter. He entertained strong prejudices against
the whites, and being naturally prone to mischief making, was willing to stir up the Indians
to resistance, without caring for the results that would be likely to follow a border war.
The likeness of him, which is here given, is said to convey a good idea of his style of dress
and the expression of his face.

On the 21st of September, General Scott and Governor Reynolds concluded a treaty with the Winnebagoes,
and the Sacs and Foxes; the provisions of which have been stated. For the faithful performance
of it, on the part of the Indians, it was stipulated that Black Hawk and his two sons, Wabokieshiek
the Prophet, Naopope and five other chiefs of the hostile band, should be retained as hostages
during the pleasure of the President. The remainder of the prisoners, captured during the campaign,
were set at liberty.

In recurring to the causes which led to this war and the spirit and military skill with which
it was conducted, there is nothing on which a citizen of the United States can dwell with satisfaction.
Looking alone to the official documents, that have been published on the subject, it would
appear that the Indians were the aggressors--that they invaded the territory of the United
States, marking their path with outrages upon the unoffending citizens; and that they were
met, encountered, and defeated, under circumstances which shed renown upon the arms and humane
policy of the government. But it is necessary, in doing justice to both parties in this contest,
to destroy this flattering picture.

Some of the causes which operated to render Black Hawk and his band, discontented with the
conduct of the United States, and with their condition upon the west side of the Mississippi,
have been enumerated. Whatever may have been their ulterior views, in returning within the
limits of the state of Illinois, in the spring of 1832, it cannot be supposed that they came
with any immediate hostile intentions. Had they been determined upon war, they would neither
have encumbered themselves with their wives and children, nor have openly recrossed the Mississippi,
near to Fort Armstrong, when they knew there was an officer of the United States army, with
a body of troops, stationed at that point, for the express purpose of preserving peace upon
the frontier. Such movements would have been at variance with the well known military policy
of the Indians. Judging from the success of General Gaines, in removing this same band, in
1831, without blood shed, to the west side of the Mississippi, it has been supposed, that a
pacific conference between the commandant of Fort Armstrong and Black Hawk, in 1832, before
he had commenced his ascent up Rock river, would have resulted in the peaceable return of the
Indians to their own hunting grounds. The condition of things at that time, warrants such a
belief, and the subsequent declarations of the Indians, strengthen the opinion, that had the
experiment been made, it would have been successful. It is true, that the commanding officer
at Fort Armstrong, sent two messages to Black Hawk upon this subject; but the first is represented
by the Indians to have been an order for them to return; and the second, that if they did not,
they would be pursued and forced to recross the Mississippi. These efforts failed, but it does
not follow that a friendly council upon the subject, would not have resulted differently.

Many causes operate in bringing about an Indian war, and in plunging the government of the
United States, prematurely and unnecessarily, into it. There is generally upon the frontiers
a class of persons who have nothing to lose, and much to gain by such a contest. It gives them
employment and circulates money among them. With such pioneer loafers, an Indian war is always
popular. Then there is the "Indian Hater,"[11] a numerous and respectable body of men, to be
found upon the frontier settlements, who, from having suffered in their persons and property
by the barbarities and plunder of the Indians, have come at length to look upon them as no
better than the wild beasts of the forest, and whose many atrocities make it a moral duty,
on the part of the whites, to exterminate by fire and the sword. Again there is the regular
squatter and land speculator, whose interest is always promoted by a war, because it usually
results in driving the Indians further back from the frontier. Intermixed with these classes,
are many quiet and worthy citizens, who with their families, have been carried to the frontiers,
in the ordinary course of events, by the tide of emigration. These may have neither a desire
for war nor a feeling of hostility towards the Indians, but when the tomahawk is raised, they
contribute to swell the alarum, and oftentimes, by their very fears of a war, do much to bring
it about. Finally, it is not to be disguised, that there are many individuals, in the states,
who are prone to look to an Indian war, as a means of gratifying their love for adventure and
excitement; or who, having political aspirations, are disposed to make the military renown,
which may be gained in a campaign, the means of attaining civic honors. It is obvious, if there
be any foundation for these positions, that an Indian war may oftentimes be undertaken without
any just cause, prosecuted without system and terminated in dishonor to our government.

When Black Hawk and his party rashly determined, in the spring of 1832, to recross the Mississippi,
a fine opportunity was presented, for getting up a border war, and the necessary machinery
was speedily put in motion. The old chief, with a few hundred braves and their women and children,
carrying with them their cooking utensils and personal property, had no sooner reached the
east bank of the Mississippi, than the alarm note was sounded upon the frontier, and echoed
from cabin to cabin, until it was spread throughout the state of Illinois. The most dreadful
anticipations of savage cruelty were indulged--the force of Black Hawk was greatly magnified--his
thirst for vengeance upon the whites was only to be appeased by blood--the state was actually
invaded by a powerful and remorseless enemy--and memorials and petitions, for an armed force
to repulse the invaders and protect the frontiers, flowed in upon the Governor, from all quarters.
Such was the excited state of public feeling, such the force of public sentiment, that little
time was left for Executive deliberation. Governor Reynolds issued his proclamation, reiterating
the dangers of the frontier, and calling for a body of the militia to march and protect it.
A call under such circumstances was promptly responded to, and in a short time, a large body
of mounted volunteers, embracing many of the most respectable and influential citizens of Illinois,
were in the vicinity of the invading foe, and ready for co-operation with the regular troops
under General Atkinson. A concentration of these two forces was made at Dixon's ferry, on Rock
river, about thirty miles below the encampment of Black Hawk and his party. Had a conference
now been sought with the Indians, their prompt submission cannot be doubted. Black Hawk, whatever
might have been his previous expectations, had received no addition of strength from other
tribes--he was almost destitute of provisions--had committed no act of hostility against the
whites, and with all his women, children and baggage, was in the vicinity of an army, principally
of mounted volunteers, many times greater than his own band of braves. He would probably have
been glad of any reasonable pretext for retracing his precipitate steps. Unfortunately no effort
for a council was made. A body of impetuous volunteers dashed on, without caution or order,
to Sycamore creek, within three miles of the camp of a part of Black Hawk's party. He instantly
sent a white flag to meet them for the purpose of holding a council, and agreeing to return
to the west side of the Mississippi. Unfortunately, for the cause of humanity, as well as the
good faith of the United States, this flag was held to be but a decoy, and without waiting
to ascertain its true character, the bearers of it were fired upon and one of them killed.
An onset was immediately made by Maj. Stillman upon Black Hawk, who finding there was no alternative
but war, met our troops, and put them to flight in the manner already described. Emboldened
by his brilliant success in this engagement, and finding that he would not be permitted to
capitulate, he sent out his war parties, removed his women and children up Rock river, and
a regular border war was commenced. The murders which his men committed upon the frontier settlers,
naturally increased the alarm throughout the state, additional volunteers rushed to the seat
of war, and the commanding General commenced his military operations for a regular campaign.
In about two months, Black Hawk, having lost many of his men, in the different skirmishes with
the American troops, and not a few of his women and children by actual starvation, found himself
upon the bank of the Mississippi, endeavoring to escape the pursuing enemy, by crossing to
the west side of that stream. While engaged in this act, the steam boat Warrior, having an
armed force on board, ascended the river for the purpose of cutting off his retreat. Once more
Black Hawk raised the white flag, and sought to surrender himself and his whole band, to the
whites. Again his flag was looked upon as a decoy, and in fifteen minutes, a round of canister
shot, from the boat, was fired, with deadly fatality into the midst of his men, women and children.
The following morning, the main army, under General Atkinson, reached the scene of action.
His force must have been six or eight times greater than that of the Indians, and by a judicious
movement, the latter was promptly surrounded on three sides by the pursuing army, while on
the other, the steam boat Warrior, the waters of the Mississippi, and a band of hostile Sioux
on its west bank, precluded all chance of escape in that quarter. A demand upon the Indians,
at this time, to surrender, unconditionally, would undoubtedly have been most cheerfully acceded
to. But it appears not to have been made. It is probable that General Atkinson whose character
for humanity, has always stood high, could not restrain the impetuosity of his troops long
enough to propose a capitulation. They had been deeply excited by the murders perpetrated by
the Black Hawk band--had been harassed by a long and fatiguing march--and perhaps felt, that
the results of the campaign, thus far, had been rather inglorious to their arms. These causes
may have conspired to precipitate them into a battle, which had been better spared than fought,
inasmuch as it resulted, necessarily, in the death of a great many miserable women and children,
who were already on the brink of the grave, from hunger and exhaustion.

A brief recapitulation of a few of the events of this disastrous campaign, has thus been made,
for the purpose of showing, that however hostile Black Hawk and his band may have been, originally,
towards the whites, he did not make the first attack upon them; and that the war might in all
probability have been prevented, or arrested in any stage of its progress, by the exercise
of that forbearance, good faith and sound policy, which should ever be cherished by the United
States.

The official report of General Atkinson to General Macomb, after the battle of the Bad-axe
has been quoted in full. On the 25th of November 1832, the Secretary at War, Mr. Cass, in his
annual report to the President, says, in speaking of this campaign,

     "General Atkinson, with the regular troops and militia under his
     command, pursued the Indians through a country very difficult to be
     penetrated, of which little was known, and where much exertion was
     required to procure regular supplies. These circumstances
     necessarily delayed the operations, and were productive of great
     responsibility to the commanding officer, and of great sufferings
     and privations to all employed in this harassing warfare. The
     Indians, however, were driven from their fastnesses, and fled
     towards the Mississippi, with the intention of seeking refuge in
     the country west of that river. They were immediately followed by
     General Atkinson, with a mounted force, overtaken, and completely
     vanquished. The arrangements of the commanding general, as well in
     the pursuit as in the action, were prompt and judicious, and the
     conduct of the officers and men was exemplary. The campaign
     terminated in the unqualified submission of the hostile party, and
     in the adoption of measures for the permanent security of the
     frontiers, and the result has produced upon the Indians of that
     region, a salutary impression, which it is to be hoped will prevent
     the recurrence of similar scenes."

On the 25th of October 1832, General Macomb transmitted to General Atkinson, the following
letter, from the Secretary at War.

                               Department at War, Oct. 24th. 1832.

     SIR: The return of the President to the seat of government, enables
     me to communicate to you his sentiments in relation to the
     operations and result of the campaign, recently conducted under your
     orders, against the hostile Indians; and it is with great pleasure,
     I have received his instructions to inform you, that he appreciates
     the difficulties you had to encounter; and that he has been highly
     gratified at the termination of your arduous and responsible duties.
     Great privations and embarrassments, necessarily attend such a
     warfare, and particularly  in the difficult country occupied by the
     enemy. The arrangements which led to the defeat of the Indians, were
     adopted with judgment and pursued with decision, and the result was
     honorable to yourself, and to the officers and men acting under your
     orders.

     I will thank you to communicate to the forces that served with you,
     both regulars and militia, the feelings of the President upon this
     occasion. I have the honor to be very respectfully, your obt.
     servant.                                   LEWIS CASS.

     Gen. H. Atkinson, Jefferson Barracks, Missouri.

In the report of the Secretary at War which has just been referred to, there is the following
statement of the causes which led to this contest. "The recent hostilities, commenced by the
Sac and Fox Indians, may be traced to causes, which have been for some time in operation, and
which left little doubt upon the minds of those acquainted with the savage character, that
they were determined to commit some aggression upon the frontier. The confederated tribes of
the Sacs and Foxes have been long distinguished for their daring spirit of adventure and for
their restless and reckless disposition. At the commencement of the eighteenth century, one
of these tribes made a desperate attempt to seize the post of Detroit; and during a period
of forty years, subsequent to that effort, they caused great trouble and embarrassment to the
French colonial government, which was only terminated by a most formidable military expedition,
sent by that enterprizing people into their remote regions west of Green Bay. During the last
war with Great Britain, this confederacy entered zealously into the contest, and was among
the most active and determined of our enemies. After the peace their communication with the
Canadian authorities was preserved; and, in every year, large parties of the most influential
chiefs and warriors visited Upper Canada, and returned laden with presents. That this continued
intercourse kept alive feelings of attachment to a foreign power and weakened the proper and
necessary influence of the United States, is known to every one who has marked the progress
of events and conduct of the Indians upon the north western frontier. The tribes upon the upper
Mississippi, particularly the Sacs and Foxes and Winnebagoes, confident in their position and
in their natural courage, and totally ignorant of the vast disproportion between their power,
and that of the United States, have always been discontented, keeping the frontier in alarm,
and continually committing some outrage upon the persons or property of the inhabitants. All
this is the result of impulse, and is the necessary and almost inevitable consequence of institutions,
which make war the great object of life. It is not probable, that any Indian seriously bent
up on hostilities, ever stops to calculate the force of the white man, and to estimate the
disastrous consequences which we know must be the result. He is impelled onward in his desperate
career, by passions which are fostered and encouraged by the whole frame of society; and he
is, very probably, stimulated by the predictions of some fanatical leader, who promises him
glory, victory and scalps.

"In this state of feeling, and with these incitements to war, the Sacs and Foxes claimed the
right of occupying a part of the country on Rock river, even after it had been sold to citizens
of the United States, and settled by them. In 1829 and in 1830, serious difficulties resulted
from their efforts to establish themselves in that section, and frequent collisions were the
consequence. Representations were made to them, and every effort, short of actual hostilities,
used by the proper officers, to induce them to abandon their unfounded pretensions, and to
confine themselves to their own country on the west side of the Mississippi river. These efforts
were successful, with the well disposed portion of the tribes, but were wholly unavailing with
the band known by the name of the "British party." In 1831, their aggressions were so serious,
and the attitude they assumed, so formidable, that a considerable detachment of the army, and
of the militia of Illinois, was called into the field; and the disaffected Indians, alarmed
by the preparation for their chastisement, agreed to reside and hunt, "upon their own lands
west of the Mississippi river," and that they would not recross this river to the usual place
of their residence, nor to any part of their old hunting grounds east of the Mississippi, without
the express permission of the President of the United States, or the Governor of the state
of Illinois.

"This arrangement had scarcely been concluded, before a flagrant outrage was committed, by
a party of these Indians, upon a band of friendly Menomomies, almost under the guns of Fort
Crawford. Twenty-five persons were wantonly murdered, and many wounded, while encamped in the
Prairie du Chien, and resting in fancied security upon our soil, and under our flag. If an
act like this, had been suffered to pass unnoticed and unpunished, a war between these tribes
would have been the consequence, in which our frontiers would have been involved, and the character
and influence of the government, would have been lost in the opinion of the Indians.

"Apprehensive, from the course of events already stated, and from other circumstances, that
the disaffected band of Sacs and Foxes, would again harass and disturb the settlements upon
our borders, and determined that the murderers of the Menomenies should be surrendered or taken,
the department ordered General Atkinson, on the 7th of March last, to ascend the Mississippi
with the disposable regular troops at Jefferson barracks, and to carry into effect the instructions
issued by your direction. Still further to strengthen the frontiers, orders were given for
the re-occupation of Chicago.

"The demand for the surrender of the Menomenie murderers was entirely disregarded: and the
British party of the Sacs and Foxes recrossed the Mississippi, and assuming a hostile attitude,
established themselves upon Rock river. The subsequent events are well known, and the result
has already been stated in this report."

In the annual report of Maj. General Macomb to Congress, of November 1832, very much the same
positions are taken in regard to the causes which led to this contest with the Indians, that
are contained in the report from the War Department. Its leading object seems to be to place
the United States in the right--the Indians in the wrong.

It is to be regretted that the Honorable Secretary, whose opinions and statements on all subjects
connected with the Indians, carry with them great weight, had not been more explicit, in assigning
the causes which led to the late war, with a portion of the Sacs and Foxes. It is not to be
supposed that the Secretary would designedly omit any thing, which in his opinion, was necessary,
to a fair presentation of this matter; but as the case stands, his statement does not, it is
believed, do justice to the Indians. But the report does not state that under the treaty of
1804, by which these lands were ceded, it is expressly provided that so long as they remain
the property of the United States, the Indians of said tribes shall enjoy the privilege of
"living and hunting upon them;" it does not state that for six or eight years before the government
had sold an acre of land upon Rock river, the white settlers were there, in violation of the
laws, trespassing upon these Indians, and thus creating that very hostility of feeling, which,
is subsequently cited as a reason for the chastisement inflicted upon them by the United States:
it does not state, that in the year 1829, government, for the purpose of creating a pretext
for the removal of the Indians from Rock river, directed a few quarter sections of land, including
the Sac village, to be sold, although the frontier settlements of Illinois had not then reached
within fifty or sixty miles of that place, and millions of acres of land around it, were unoccupied
and unsold: it does not state that instead of requiring the Indians to remove from the quarter
sections thus prematurely sold, to other lands on Rock river, owned by the United States, and
on which, under the treaty, they had a right to hunt and reside, they were commanded to remove
to the west side of the Mississippi: it does not state, that the "serious aggressions" and
"formidable attitude" assumed by the "British party," in 1831, consisted in their attempt to
raise a crop of corn and beans, in throwing down the fences of the whites who were enclosing
their fields, in "pointing deadly weapons" at them and in "stealing their potatoes:" it does
not state that the murder of the Menominie Indians, at Fort Crawford, by a party of the "British
band," was in retaliation, for a similar "flagrant outrage," committed the summer previous,
by the Menominies, upon Peah-mus-ka, a principal chief of the Foxes and nine or ten of his
tribe, who were going up to Prairie des Chiens on business and were within one day's travel
of that place: it does not state that one reason assigned by the "British party" for refusing
to surrender the murderers of the Menominies, was the fact that the government had not made
a similar demand of that tribe for the murderers of the Sacs: it does not state that the "hostile
attitude" assumed by the Sacs and Foxes, in 1832, after recrossing the Mississippi, and their
establishment on Rock river, simply amounted to this; that they came over with their women
and children for the avowed purpose of raising a crop of corn with the Winnebagoes--were temporarily
encamped on that stream--had committed no outrage upon person or property--and were actually
engaged in entertaining some guests with a dog-feast, when the Illinois militia approached
their camp, and killed the bearer of a white flag, which Black Hawk sent to them, in token
of his peaceable disposition. These may be unimportant omissions, in the opinion of the Secretary,
but in looking to the causes which led to this contest, and the spirit in which it was conducted,
they have been deemed of sufficient importance, to receive a passing notice, when referring
to his report.

The opinion has been expressed more than once in the course of this work, that there was in
reality, no necessity for this war. A firm but forbearing course of policy, on the part of
the United States, towards this discontented fragment of the Sacs and Foxes, would, it is believed,
have prevented any serious aggression upon our people or their property. Certain it is, that
a few thousand dollars, superadded to a humane spirit of conciliation, would have effected
the permanent removal of Black Hawk and his band, to the west side of the Mississippi: and,
as the government was not contending with them, in support of its national faith, nor about
to punish them for an insult to its national honour, there could have been no disgrace in purchasing
the settlement of the difficulty, on such terms. It has been stated that in the spring of 1831,
Black Hawk agreed to remove his band to the west side of the Mississippi, and relinquish all
claims to the lands upon Rock river, if the United States would pay him six thousand dollars,
with which to purchase provisions and other necessaries for his people; and that the Indian
agent at St. Louis, was informed of this fact. Moreover, it has been publicly alleged that
before the campaign against Black Hawk, in the summer of 1832, the President and Secretary
at War, were both informed, that the "British Band" of the Sacs and Foxes, could be peaceably
removed to the west side of the Mississippi for six or eight thousand dollars. The secretary
was assured, in the presence of a member of congress, that the inquiry had been made by a person
familiar with the Indians, and the fact of their willingness to remove upon these terms distinctly
ascertained.[12]

Under the treaty of 1804, the Sacs and Foxes ceded to the United States, more than twenty millions
of acres of first rate land, for less than twenty thousand dollars. Black Hawk not only contended
for the invalidity of this treaty, but insisted that the price paid by the United States was
wholly below the value of the land. Under such circumstances, the course of the government
was obvious--to have quieted the complaints of the Indians and secured their peaceable removal
to the west, by a second purchase of their interest to the territory in question. Had it cost
twenty, fifty or one hundred thousand dollars, to effect this object, our country would still
have been the gainer, both by the preservation of the national faith and the national treasure--for
the former was wantonly violated, and the latter uselessly squandered. The contest with Black
Hawk and his party, destroyed the lives of four or five hundred Indian men, women and children--about
two hundred citizens of the United States--and cost the government near two millions of dollars!
Such are the results of a war commenced and waged by a great nation, upon a remnant of poor
ignorant savages;--a war which had its origin in avarice and political ambition, which was
prosecuted in bad faith and closed in dishonor.

Black Hawk, his two sons, Naopope, Wabokiesheik, and the other prisoners, who under the treaty
of 21st September, were to be held as hostages, during the pleasure of the president, having
been sent down the Mississippi, to Jefferson Barracks, under charge of Lieutenant Davis, were
immediately put in irons, a measure of precaution, apparently, as unnecessary as it was cruel.

"We were now confined," says the old chief, "to the barracks, and forced to wear the ball and
chain! This was extremely mortifying, and altogether useless. Was the White Beaver [Gen. Atkinson]
afraid that I would break out of his barracks and run away? Or was he ordered to inflict this
punishment upon me? If I had taken him prisoner upon the field of battle, I would not have
wounded his feelings so much, by such treatment, knowing that a brave war chief would prefer
death to dishonor. But I do not blame the White Beaver for the course he pursued--it is the
custom among white soldiers, and I suppose was a part of his duty.

"The time dragged heavily and gloomily along throughout the winter, although the White Beaver
did every thing in his power to render us comfortable. Having been accustomed throughout a
long life, to roam through the forests--to come and go at liberty--confinement under any such
circumstances, could not be less than torture.

"We passed away the time making pipes, until spring, when we were visited by the agent, trader,
and interpreter, from Rock Island, Keokuk, and several chiefs and braves of our nation, and
my wife and daughter. I was rejoiced to see the two latter, and spent my time very agreeably
with them and my people as long as they remained."

During the winter they were visited by a great number of persons, one of whom remarks, "We
were immediately struck with admiration at the gigantic and symmetrical figures of most of
the warriors, who seemed as they reclined, in native ease and gracefulness, with their half
naked bodies exposed to view, rather like statues from some master hand, than beings of a race
whom we had heard characterized as degenerate and debased. They were clad in leggins and moccasins
of buckskin, and wore blankets, which were thrown around them in the manner of the Roman toga,
so as to leave their right arms bare. The youngest among them were painted on their necks,
with a bright vermilion color, and had their faces transversely streaked, with alternate red
and black stripes. From their faces and eyebrows, they pluck out the hair with the most assiduous
care. They also shave or pull it out from their heads, with the exception of a tuft about three
fingers width, extending from between the forehead and crown to the back of the head; this
they sometimes plait into a queue on the crown, and cut the edges of it down to an inch in
length, and plaster it with the vermilion which keeps it erect, and gives it the appearance
of a cock's comb." The same writer adds, that, "but for the want of that peculiar expression
which emanates from a cultivated intellect," Nasinewiskuk, the eldest son of Black Hawk, could
have "been looked upon as the very personification, of the beau ideal of manly beauty." Among
their many visitors while at this place, was the distinguished author of the "Sketch Book,"
who in a letter, under date of 18th of Dec. 1832, says, "From St. Louis, I went to Fort Jefferson,
about nine miles distant, to see Black Hawk, the Indian warrior and his fellow prisoners--a
forlorn crew--emaciated and dejected--the redoubtable chieftain himself, a meagre old man upwards
of seventy. He has, however, a fine head, a Roman style of face, and a prepossessing countenance."[13]
When Catlin the artist, visited Jefferson Barracks for the purpose of painting the portraits
of these chiefs, and was about to commence the likeness of Naopope, he seized the ball and
chain that were fastened to his leg, and raising them on high, exclaimed with a look of scorn,
"make me so, and show me to the great father." Upon the artist's refusing to paint him as he
wished, he kept varying his countenance with grimaces, to prevent him from catching a likeness.

During the visit of Keokuk to Jefferson Barracks, he made exertions to obtain the release of
the prisoners, pledging himself to the Indian agent at St. Louis, and to General Atkinson,
to be responsible for their good conduct in future. Soon afterwards, however, the General received
orders from the secretary at war to have the prisoners sent to Washington city. It was in the
latter part of April, 1833, that they reached the capitol, under the escort of an officer of
the army. In the first interview between President Jackson and Black Hawk, the latter is represented
to have said, "I am a man and you are another." In the course of their interview, the President
informed him that he and his companions must proceed on the following day to Fortress Monroe,
there to remain, until the conduct of their people at home was such as to justify their being
set at liberty. In reply to this, the Prophet said, "We expected to return immediately to our
people. The war in which we have been involved was occasioned by our attempting to raise provisions
on our own lands, or where we thought we had a right so to do. We have lost many of our people,
as well as the whites. Our tribes and families are now exposed to the attacks of our enemies,
the Sioux, and the Menominies. We hope, therefore, to be permitted to return home to take care
of them." Black Hawk concluded his address to the President, which embraced a history of the
late war, by saying, "We did not expect to conquer the whites, no. They had too many houses,
too many men. I took up the hatchet, for my part, to revenge injuries which my people could
no longer endure. Had I borne them longer without striking, my people would have said, Black
Hawk is a woman. He is too old to be a chief--he is no Sac. These reflections caused me to
raise the war-whoop. I say no more of it; it is known to you. Keokuk once was here; you took
him by the hand, and when he wished to return to his home, you were willing. Black Hawk expects,
that, like Keokuk, we shall be permitted to return too." The President gave them assurances
that their women and children should be protected from the Sioux and the Menominies, and that
so soon as he was satisfied that peace was restored on the frontiers, they should be permitted
to return home.

On the 26th of April, they set off for Fortress Monroe, at Old Point Comfort, where they remained
until the fourth of June, when, an order was received, from the President, by the commanding
officer, for the liberation of the Indian captives. The kind treatment of the prisoners by
Colonel Eustis, then in command at Fortress Monroe, had won greatly upon their regard. When
about to depart, Black Hawk waited upon the Colonel, and said;--

"Brother, I have come on my own part, and in behalf of my companions, to bid you farewell.
Our great father has at length been pleased to permit us to return to our hunting grounds.
We have buried the tomahawk, and the sound of the rifle will hereafter only bring death to
the deer and the buffalo. Brother, you have treated the red men very kindly. Your squaws have
made them presents, and you have given them plenty to eat and drink. The memory of your friendship
will remain till the Great Spirit says it is time for Black Hawk to sing his death-song. Brother,
your houses are as numerous as the leaves upon the trees, and your young warriors, like the
sands upon the shore of the big lake that rolls before us. The red man has but few houses,
and few warriors, but the red man has a heart which throbs as warmly as the heart of his white
brother. The Great Spirit has given us our hunting grounds, and the skin of the deer which
we kill there, is his favorite, for its color is white, and this is the emblem of peace. This
hunting dress and these feathers of the eagle are white. Accept them, my brother; I have given
one like this to the White Otter. Accept of it as a memorial of Black Hawk. When he is far
away this will serve to remind you of him. May the Great Spirit bless you and your children--farewell."

On the fifth of June, under the charge of Major John Garland of the United States army, Black
Hawk and his five companions, took their departure from Fortress Monroe. Before leaving the
Chesapeake, they visited Norfolk and the Navy Yard at Gosport. They were taken on board the
Delaware, 74, and were much delighted with its appearance. Black Hawk expressed a strong desire
to see the chief who commanded it, and to take the man who built it, by the hand.

At Norfolk a large concourse of persons visited them. Wabokieshiek, the prophet, addressed
them from the balcony of their hotel, as follows:

"The Great Spirit sent us here, and now happily we are about to return, to our own Mississippi,
and our own people. It affords us much happiness to rejoin our friends and kindred. We would
shake hands with all our white friends assembled here. Should any of them go to our country
on the Mississippi, we would take pleasure in returning their kindness to us. We will go home
with peaceable dispositions towards our white brethren, and make our conduct hereafter, more
satisfactory to them. We bid you all farewell, as it is the last time we shall see each other."

Black Hawk made a few remarks, and at one o'clock, June the fifth, they started for Baltimore,
which place they reached at eleven o'clock on the following day, and were greeted by crowds
of curious spectators. The renown of Black Hawk had every where preceded him, and all were
anxious to behold the old chief whose name and deeds had excited so much commotion on the frontiers
of the north west. The President happened to be in Baltimore at the same time, and, the "monumental
city" was never, perhaps, honored by the presence of two more distinguished "lions" upon the
same day, than upon this occasion. They both attended the theatre on the evening of the sixth;
and, it is said, that the attention of the house was very equally divided between them. On
the following day an interview took place between them, when the President said to the old chief;--

"When I saw you in Washington, I told you that you had behaved very badly, in raising the tomahawk
against the white people, and killing men, women and children upon the frontier. Your conduct
last year, compelled me to send my warriors against you, and your people were defeated, with
great loss, and your men surrendered, to be kept until I should be satisfied, that you would
not try to do any more injury. I told you, I would enquire whether your people wished you to
return, and, whether if you did return, there would be any danger to the frontier. Gen. Clark
and Gen. Atkinson, whom you know, have informed me that Sheckak, your principal chief, and
the rest of your people are anxious you should return, and Keokuk has asked me to send you
back. Your chiefs have pledged themselves for your good conduct, and I have given directions
that you should be taken to your own country.

"Maj. Garland who is with you will conduct you through some of our towns. You will see the
strength of the white people. You will see that our young men are as numerous, as the leaves
in the woods. What can you do against us? You may kill a few women and children, but such a
force would soon be sent against you, as would destroy your whole tribe. Let the red men hunt
and take care of their families, but I hope they will not again raise their hands against their
white brethren. We do not wish to injure you. We desire your prosperity and improvement. But
if you again plunge your knives into the breasts of our people, I shall send a force, which
will severely punish you for all your cruelties. When you go back, listen to the councils of
Keokuk and the other friendly chiefs. Bury the tomahawk and live in peace with the frontiers.
And I pray the Great Spirit to give you a smooth path and a fair sky to return."

The reply of Black Hawk to this address, was brief, and the Prophet merely said,

"My father,--my ears are open to your words. I am glad to hear them. I am glad to go back to
my people. I want to see my family. I did not behave well last summer. I ought not to have
taken up the tomahawk. But my people have suffered a great deal. When I get back I will remember
your words. I won't go to war again. I will live in peace. I shall hold you by the hand."

The object of the President, in directing the captives to be taken home through some of the
principal cities of the union, was to exhibit to them the extent of the population, wealth,
and means of defence of the United States; in the hope, that such impressions would be made
on their minds, as would induce them to refrain from creating disturbances in future upon the
frontiers. They were accordingly directed to be carried as far north as Boston, and thence
through Albany, Buffalo and Detroit, to their own country.

The captives reached Philadelphia on the 10th of June, and remained at Congress Hall, until
the 14th. During their stay in the city, which was prolonged to four or five days, they visited
the United States' Mint, the Fair Mount Water Works and other objects of curiosity. They had
also an opportunity of witnessing a grand military display in front of their quarters in Congress
Hall. Black Hawk wished to know if these were the same soldiers, who were in his country last
summer. In making reference to his late contest with the United States, he said to those around
him,

"My heart grew bitter against the whites, and my hands strong. I dug up the tomahawk, and led
on my warriors to fight. I fought hard. I was no coward. Much blood was shed. But the white
men were mighty. They were many as the leaves of the forest. I and my people failed. I am sorry
the tomahawk was raised. I have been a prisoner. I see the strength of the white men. They
are many, very many. The Indians are but few. They are not cowards. They are brave, but they
are few. While the Great Spirit above, keeps my heart as it now is, I will be the white man's
friend. I will remain in peace. I will go to my people and speak good of the white man. I will
tell them, they are as the leaves of the forest. Very many--very strong; and that I will fight
no more against them."

On the morning of the 14th, they set off for New York, and reached that city at 5 P.M. and
had an opportunity, at the moment of their arrival at the Battery, of beholding the greatest
assemblage of people they had yet seen, drawn together to witness the ascent of a balloon from
Castle Garden. This novel spectacle, greatly astonished the Indians, and one of them asked
the prophet, if the aeronaut was "going to see the Great Spirit." When the crowd ascertained
that Black Hawk and his party were on the steam boat, the air resounded with shouts of welcome.
Upon their landing, such was the press of the multitude to get a look at the strangers, that
they could not reach their lodgings until placed in carriages, and committed to the charge
of the police officers. They were finally, with much difficulty, taken to the Exchange Hotel,
which was immediately surrounded by thousands of people, who would not retire to their houses,
until "General Black Hawk," had presented himself several times at the window, and graciously
bowed to the eager and admiring multitude. During their whole visit to the city of New York,
they were treated with marked attention. Their rooms were crowded, daily, with ladies and gentlemen,
and they were conducted with ceremony to the theatres, the public gardens, the arsenal, and
other places of interest. Speeches were made to them, and they received many handsome presents.
Among other civilities, John A. Graham, Esq., waited upon them, and made the following address.

"Brothers, open your ears. You are brave men. You have fought like tigers, but in a bad cause.
We have conquered you. We were sorry last year, that you raised the tomahawk against us; but
we believe you did not know us then as you do now. We think that in time to come, you will
be wise and that we shall be friends forever. You see that we are a great people--numerous
as the flowers of the field, as the shells on the sea-shore, or the fish in the sea. We put
one hand on the eastern, and, at the same time, the other on the western ocean. We all act
together. If some time our great men talk long and loud at our council fires, but shed one
drop of white men's blood, our young warriors, as thick as the stars of the night, will leap
on board of our great boats, which fly on the waves, and over the lakes--swift as the eagle
in the air--then penetrate the woods, make the big guns thunder, and the whole heavens red
with the flames of the dwellings of their enemies. Brothers, the President has made you a great
talk. He has but one mouth. That one has sounded the sentiments of all the people. Listen to
what he has said to you. Write it on your memories. It is good--very good.

"Black Hawk, take these jewels, a pair of topaz earrings, beautifully set in gold, for your
wife or daughter, as a token of friendship, keeping always in mind, that women and children
are the favorites of the Great Spirit. These jewels are from an old man, whose head is whitened
with the snows of seventy winters, an old man who has thrown down his bow, put off his sword,
and now stands leaning on his staff, waiting the commands of the Great Spirit. Look around
you, see all this mighty people, then go to your homes, open your arms, to receive your families.
Tell them to bury the hatchet, to make bright the chain of friendship, to love the white men,
and to live in peace with them, as long as the rivers run into the sea, and the sun rises and
sets. If you do so, you will be happy. You will then ensure the prosperity of unborn generations
of your tribes, who will go hand in hand with the sons of the white men, and all shall be blessed
by the Great Spirit. Peace and happiness by the blessing of the Great Spirit attend you. Farewell."

Black Hawk accepted the present and said in reply.

"Brother, we like your talk. We will be friends. We like the white people. They are very kind
to us. We shall not forget it. Your counsel is good. We shall attend to it. Your valuable present
shall go to my squaw. We shall always be friends."

While at New York, Major Garland came to the determination not to take the captives to Boston,
but to ascend the North river, and proceed directly to the west. This created much disappointment,
among the citizens of that city, who were generally anxious to behold the "great agitator"
of the north western frontier.

In pursuance of this new arrangement, on the 22d of June, the party left New York, in a steam
boat for Albany, where they arrived on the following day. At this city, they were met by a
crowd of spectators, drawn together by their anxiety to see Black Hawk, so numerous, that it
was found necessary to disguise the Indians, in order to enable them to reach their lodgings.
They remained in Albany until the morning of the 25th, when they departed for Buffalo, which
place they reached on the twenty-eighth. During their stay in Buffalo which lasted for three
days, they had an interesting interview with some of the Seneca Indians, who are residing on
their reservation near that place. They were addressed by Karlundawana, a worthy Seneca chief,
who after expressing the pleasure of his people to meet the Sacs and Foxes, and referring to
the condition of the Indians generally, respectfully counselled Black Hawk and his party, to
return home in a peaceable mind; to take up the tomahawk no more against the white people;
but to cultivate the earth, and be happy. Black Hawk replied, "Our aged brother of the Senecas,
who has spoken to us, has spoken the words of a good and a wise man. We are strangers to each
other, though we have the same color, and the same Great Spirit made us all, and gave us this
country together. Brothers we have seen how great a people the whites are. They are very rich
and very strong. It is folly for us to fight with them. We shall go home with much knowledge.
For myself I shall advise my people to be quiet, and live like good men. The advice which you
gave us, brother, is very good, and we tell you now we mean to walk the straight path in future,
and to content ourselves with what we have, and with cultivating our lands."

From Buffalo the captives were taken by water to Detroit, where their reception is said to
have been much less enthusiastic than in the other cities through which they had passed. It
was stated in the newspapers of the day, that they were burnt in effigy in that place. Black
Hawk, in visiting the the former residence of Governor Cass, remarked, "This is the old council
ground. I have had much good counsel here; but my trail led to the opposite shore, and my ears
were closed." Their visit to Detroit being over, they proceeded to Green Bay, and thence descended
the Wisconsin to the Mississippi and down that river to Fort Armstrong, on Rock Island, which
place they reached about the first of August. In passing by the site of the old Sac village,
Black Hawk was deeply affected, and expressed much regret for the causes which compelled him
to emigrate beyond the Mississippi. The return of the Prophet was also attended with melancholy
associations. His village over which he had long presided, was entirely broken up--his wigwam
in ashes--his family dispersed, and, he, a suppliant for a home in the village of some other chief.

Fort Armstrong, was chosen by Major Garland as the most appropriate spot for the ceremonies
of the liberation of Black Hawk and his party; as its central position, would enable him to
assemble, at a short notice, many Indians from the surrounding villages. This was the favorite
island of the Indians; in former years abundant in fruits and flowers; and, from time immemorial
the fancied abode of a good Spirit, which watched over their village, and protected their hunting
grounds. No spot could have been selected, calculated to awaken so many painful associations
in the mind of Black Hawk, as Rock Island. For half a century it had been the witness of his
power and influence; it was now to become the scene of his disgrace, and reluctant submission
to a rival.

Immediately after Major Garland's arrival at Fort Armstrong, he sent out runners for the purpose
of assembling the neighboring Indians. The messenger despatched for Keokuk and his chiefs,
found them encamped about twenty miles below the island, having just returned from a buffalo
hunt, and being on their way to fort Armstrong, in expectation of meeting the returning captives.
The runner returned that night, and reported to Major Garland, that on the morrow, Keokuk with
a party of braves would reach Rock Island. About noon, on the following day, the sound of the
Indian drum, and the shouts and wild songs of his people, announced the approach of the princely
Keokuk. He ascended the Mississippi by water, and led the van with two large canoes, lashed
side by side, handsomely decorated, with a canopy erected over them, beneath which sat the
chief and his three wives, with the American flag waving over them. More than twenty canoes
followed the chieftain, each containing from four to eight of his warriors, whose shouts and
songs, swept over the transparent waters of the Mississippi, and were echoed from shore to
shore. This fleet of canoes, was rowed slowly up the stream, until it passed the camp of the
captives; it then returned and the party landed on the bank of the river, opposite to the camp
of Black Hawk. Here Keokuk and his party spent several hours in arranging their dress, painting
their faces and equipping themselves with their implements of war. This duty of the toilet
being finished, they returned to their canoes, resumed their songs, and proceeded directly
across the river. Keokuk, very elegantly dressed, decorated with his medals and fully armed,
was the first to land, and turning to his followers, said, "The Great Spirit has sent our brother
back. Let us shake hands with him in friendship." He then proceeded slowly, followed by his
warriors, towards Black Hawk, who was seated, with his party, in front of his temporary lodge,
leaning upon his staff, and deeply affected by the occasion. Keokuk kindly extended his hand
to him, which the old man took with some cordiality. Having saluted the rest of the captives,
he took a seat, his companions following his example. For some time all was silence--no one
presuming to utter a word until the chief had spoken. At last, Keokuk inquired of Black Hawk
how long he had been upon the road; and, remarked that he had been expecting his arrival, and
was coming up the river to meet him, when met by the messenger of Major Garland. The pipe was
now introduced and passed round among both parties, and an interchange of friendly civilities
ensued. After an hour of alternate smoking and talking, Keokuk arose and shook hands with Black
Hawk, saying he should return to-morrow; and then recrossed the river in silence. A considerable
part of that night was spent by the chief and his party in singing and dancing.

The grand council, for the final liberation of the captives, was held, with all due solemnity,
upon the ensuing day. It presented the novel spectacle of a chief, compelled by a third power,
to acknowledge the authority of a rival, and formally descend from the rank which he had long
sustained among his people. Fort Armstrong presented a commodious room, for the ceremonies
of the day, and it was fitted up for the occasion. About ten o'clock in the forenoon, Keokuk
and one hundred followers, recrossed the river, and proceeded in martial array to the garrison.
They were conducted into the council room, and shown the seats which they were to occupy. Keokuk
was seated with Pashepahow (the Stabber) on one side, Wapellar (the little Prince) on the other.
The former a chief of the Sacs, the latter of the Foxes. The remainder of his band took their
seats in the rear, and maintained throughout the ceremony, profound silence.

It was not long before Black Hawk and his associates, made their appearance. As they entered
the room, Keokuk and the two chiefs by his side, arose and greeted them. They were seated directly
opposite to Keokuk. Black Hawk, and his son, Nasinewiskuk, who seems to have been warmly attached
to his father, appeared to be much dejected. They had the day previous made objections to this
council, as unnecessary, and painful to their feelings. They now came into it with deep feelings
of mortification. For a time profound silence reigned throughout the assembly. Major Garland
at length arose and addressed the council. He was pleased to find so much good feeling existing
among the Sacs and Foxes towards Black Hawk and his party; and he felt confident from what
he had observed, since their arrival, that they would hereafter live in peace: He had but little
further to add, as the President's speech, addressed to Black Hawk and his party, in Baltimore,
contained the views of their great Father on the matters before them; and, this speech he should
cause to be again interpreted to them.

Keokuk followed Major Garland, and after having shaken hands with those around him said,

"I have listened to the talk of our great Father. It is true we pledged our honor with those
of our young braves, for the liberation of our friends. We thought much of it--our councils
were long--their wives and children were in our thoughts--when we talked of them our hearts
were full. Their wives and children came to see us, which made us feel like women; but we were
men. The words which we sent to our great Father were good: he spoke like the father of children.
The Great Spirit made his heart big in council. We receive our brothers in friendship--our
hearts are good towards them. They once listened to bad counsel; now their ears are closed:
I give my hand to them; when they shake it, they shake the hands of all. I will shake hands
with them, and then I am done."

Major Garland rose a second time, and stated, that he wished it to be distinctly understood
by all persons present, in the council, that their great Father, the President, would hereafter
receive and acknowledge Keokuk, as the principal chief of the Sac and Fox nation; that he wished
and expected Black Hawk to listen and conform to his counsels; if any unkind feeling now existed,
it must that day be buried, and, that the band of Black Hawk must be henceforth merged in that
of Keokuk. The interpreter so reported the remarks of Major Garland, that Black Hawk understood
the President to say that he must conform to the counsels of Keokuk; and, the old chief, losing
all command of his feelings, became deeply and instantly excited. The spirit which had sustained
him in earlier and better days, burst forth with uncontrollable violence. He sprung upon his
feet, but so deeply excited as to be almost unable to utter a word. With the most indignant
expression of countenance, and with a vehemence of manner characteristic of the savage when
roused to action, he exclaimed,

"I am a man--an old man--I will not conform to the counsels of any one. I will act for myself--no
one shall govern me. I am old--my hair is gray--I once gave counsels to my young men--Am I
to conform to others? I shall soon go to the Great Spirit, when I shall be at rest. What I
said to our great Father at Washington, I say again--I will always listen to him. I am done."

The speech of Black Hawk--the last struggle of a fallen chieftain, caused a momentary excitement
throughout the council. When it had subsided, the interpreter was directed to explain to him,
that the President had only requested him to listen to the counsels of Keokuk. He made no reply,
but drawing his blanket around him, sat in moody silence. Keokuk approached him, and in a low
but kind tone of voice said, "Why do you speak so before the white men? I will speak for you;
you trembled--you did not mean what you said." Black Hawk gloomily assented, when Keokuk arose
and remarked to the council,

"Our brother who has again come to us, has spoken, but he spoke in wrath--his tongue was forked--he
spoke not like a man, a Sac. He knew his words were bad: he trembled like the oak whose roots
have been wasted away by many rains. He is old--what he said let us forget. He says he did
not mean it--he wishes it forgotten. I have spoken for him. What I have said are his own words--not
mine. Let us say he spoke in council to-day--that his words were good. I have spoken."

Colonel Davenport of the United States army, then in command of Fort Armstrong, next arose,
and taking Black Hawk by the hand, remarked that he was glad to meet him, that once he was
his enemy, but now he met him as a friend; that he was there by the command of the President,
and should always be glad to see him; and, would at all times be ready to give him any advice
which he might need: that during his absence he had held frequent talks with the Sacs and Foxes,
who were anxious for his return, and he felt authorized to say, that the nation entertained
for him and his party, the most friendly feeling. Black Hawk listened with much apparent interest
to the remarks of Colonel Davenport.[14]

Major Garland now arose and told Black Hawk he was at liberty to go where he pleased;--that
the people of the United States, as well as himself, were pleased with the uniform good conduct
of all the captives while among them--that they were convinced their hearts were good, but
they had listened to bad counsels: Having now seen the power of the white men, and taken their
great father by the hand, who had restored them to their families, he hoped there would be
no further difficulties; but that peace and harmony would long exist between them.

Black Hawk, rose in reply, cool and collected, and remarked, that having reflected upon what
he had said, it was his wish that if his speech had been put upon paper, a line might be drawn
over it--he did not mean it.

Wapellar, the chief of the Foxes, rose up to say that he had nothing to say. "I am not in the
habit of talking--I think--I have been thinking all day--Keokuk has spoken: am glad to see
my brothers: I will shake hands with them. I am done." The chiefs all arose, a general shaking
of hands, followed by an interchange of civilities, ensued, and the council finally adjourned.

In the evening, Maj. Garland invited the principal chiefs, together with Black Hawk, to his
quarters, as it would afford a good opportunity to ascertain explicitly, the feeling which
existed among them towards their fallen foe. About seven o'clock they arrived. They took their
seats in silence, passed the pipe for all to take a whiff, and in return, quaffed a glass of
champagne, which seemed to have a peculiar relish. Pashepahow, shook hands with all present,
and commenced:--

"We met this morning: I am glad to meet again. That wine is very good; I never drank any before;
I have thought much of our meeting to-day: it was one that told us we were brothers:--that
we were Sacs. We had just returned from a buffalo hunt, we thought it was time for our brothers
to be here, as our father at St. Louis told us this was the moon. We started before the rising
sun to meet you; we have met, and taken our brothers by the hand in friendship. They always
mistrusted our counsels, and went from the trail of the red men, where there was no hunting
grounds nor friends; they returned and found the dogs howling around their wigwams, and wives
looking for their husbands and children. They said we counselled like women, but they have
found our counsels were good. They have been through the country of our great Father. They
have been to the wigwams of the white men, they received them in kindness, and made glad their
hearts. We thank them: say to them that Keokuk and Pashepahow thank them. Our brother has promised
to listen to the counsels of Keokuk. What he said in council to-day, was like the Mississippi
fog--the sun has shone and the day is clear--let us forget it--he did not mean it. His heart
is good, but his ears have been open to bad counsels. He has taken our great Father by the
hand, whose words are good. He listened to them and has closed his ears to the voice that comes
across the great waters. He now knows that he ought to listen to Keokuk. He counselled with
us and our young braves, who listened to his talk. We told our great Father that all would
be peace. He opened his dark prison and let him see the sun once more, gave him to his wife
and children, who were without a lodge. Our great Father made straight his path to his home.
I once took the great chief of the Osages prisoner. I heard the cries of his women and children;
I took him out by the rising sun, and put him upon the trail to his village; "there" said I,
"is the trail to your village; go and tell your people, that I, Pashepahow, the chief of the
Sacs, sent you." We thank our great Father--our hearts are good towards him; I will see him
before I lay down in peace: may the Great Spirit be in his councils. What our brother said
to-day let us forget; I am done."

Keokuk, after going through the usual ceremonies, said, "We feel proud that you have invited
us here this evening, to drink a glass with you; the wine which we have drank, we never tasted
before; it is the wine which the white men make, who know how to make anything: I will take
another glass, as I have much to say; we feel proud that we can drink such wine: to-day we
shook hands with our brothers, who you brought to us; we were glad to see them; we have often
thought of our brothers; many of our nation said they would never return: their wives and children
often came to our wigwams, which made us feel sad: what Pashepahow has said is true; I talked
to our young men, who had the hearts of men; I told them that the Great Spirit was in our councils,
they promised to live in peace: those who listened to bad counsels, and followed our brothers,
have said their ears are closed, they will live in peace. I sent their words to our great Father,
whose ears were open, whose heart was made sad by the conduct of our brothers; he has sent
them to their wigwams. We thank him: say to him Keokuk thanks him. Our brothers have seen the
great villages of the white men: they travelled a long road and found the Americans like grass;
I will tell our young men to listen to what they shall tell them. Many years ago I went through
the villages of our great Father--he had many--they were like the great prairies; but he has
gone; another is our father; he is a great war chief; I want to see him; I shall be proud to
take him by the hand; I have heard much of him, his head is gray, I must see him: tell him
that as soon as the snow is off the prairie, I shall come. What I have said I wish spoken to
him, before it is put upon paper, so that he shall hear it, as I have said it: tell him that
Keokuk spoke it: What our brother said in council to-day, let us forget; he told me to speak;
I spoke his words; I have spoken."

Black Hawk then said, in a calm and dejected manner,

"I feel that I am an old man; once I could speak, but now I have but little to say; to-day
we met many of our brothers; we were glad to see them. I have listened to what my brothers
have said, their hearts are good; they have been like Sacs, since I left them; they have taken
care of my wife and children, who had no wigwam; I thank them for it, the Great Spirit knows
that I thank them; before the sun gets behind the hills to-morrow, I shall see them; I want
to see them; when I left them, I expected soon to return; I told our great father when in Washington,
that I would listen to the counsels of Keokuk. I shall soon be far away, I shall have no village,
no band; I shall live alone. What I said in council to-day, I wish forgotten. If it has been
put upon paper, I wish a mark to be drawn over it. I did not mean it. Now we are alone let
us say, we will forget it. Say to our great father and Governor Cass, that I will listen to
them. Many years ago I met Governor Cass in councils, far across the prairies to the rising
sun. His counsels were good. My ears were closed; I listened to the great father across the
waters. My father listened to him whose band was large.--My band was once large. Now I have
no band. I and my son and all the party, thank our great father for what he has done. He is
old, I am old; we shall soon go to the great Spirit, where we shall rest. He sent us through
his great villages. We saw many of the white men, who treated us with kindness. We thank them.
We thank you and Mr. Sprague for coming with us. Your road was long and crooked. We never saw
so many white men before. When you were with us, we felt as though we had some friends among
them. We felt safe. You knew them all. When you come upon the Mississippi again, you shall
come to my wigwam. I have none now. On your road home, you will pass where my village once
was. No one lives there now; all are gone. I give you my hand; we may never meet again; I shall
long remember you: The Great Spirit will be with you, and your wives and children. Before the
sun rises, I shall go to my family. My son will be here to see you before we go. I will shake
hands with my brothers here, then I am done."

Early on the following morning, the Indians crossed to the west side of the Mississippi, and
returned to their villages.

In the autumn of 1837, deputations from several Indian tribes, residing upon the waters of
the upper Mississippi, were invited to Washington city, by direction of the President of the
United States. Among those represented were the united Sac and Fox tribe, and their ancient
enemy the Sioux, between whom hostilities were then raging. For the purpose of effecting a
peace between them, and also making a purchase of land of the Sioux, several councils were
held under the direction of the Secretary at War, but without accomplishing the object in either
case. Black Hawk, was connected with the delegation from the Sacs and Foxes, but not in the
character of a delegate or chief. Keokuk, apprehensive, that if left at home, the old man might
create some new difficulty, had prudently taken him along. He treated him, uniformly, with
great respect, and invited him to sit with them in the councils.

After leaving Washington the delegation visited the principal eastern cities, and Black Hawk
again attracted much attention. Public curiosity was still alive to see the renowned but fallen
chieftain of the famous Black Hawk war. In Boston, which place he did not visit on his former
tour, he was waited upon by a great concourse of citizens, and in common with the rest of the
delegation, was publicly presented with some military weapons by the governor of the state,
and made a brief speech upon the occasion.

Before the return of the deputation to the west, they remained a few hours in Cincinnati. Keokuk
was sick and received but few visitors. "Which is Black Hawk," was the eager inquiry of almost
every individual who succeeded in threading his way through the crowd, to the cabin of the
steam boat. The old man manifested no interest in the passing scene. He was not inclined to
conversation, but sat moody and silent, with an expression of countenance strongly indicative
of wounded pride and disappointed ambition. He seemed to feel deeply the degradation of his
situation. Shorn of power among his people, compelled to acknowledge the authority of his rival,
and bending beneath the infirmities of age, it is not singular that he should shrink from the
prying gaze of curiosity, and sigh for the deep seclusion of his wild hunting grounds.

In height Black Hawk is about five feet ten inches, with broad shoulders, but limbs not very
muscular. His nose is sharp and slightly aquiline, and his eyes are of a dark hazel color.
The most striking peculiarity in his personal appearance is the head, which is singularly formed,
and has been pronounced, by some observers, the envy of phrenologists. His countenance is mild
and benevolent, having little if any of that dark and ferocious expression, not uncommon among
the Indians; and which, during the late border war, was imagined to be eminently characteristic
of Black Hawk. In tracing his history, few, if any incidents can be found, which bear out the
charge of savage cruelty that has sometimes been preferred against him. On the contrary, he
seems to have an amiable disposition. He himself repels, with indignation, the charge of his
ever having murdered women and children; and, declares the accusation made against him, on
this point, to be wholly false. The character of Black Hawk for honesty in his dealings, and
for general integrity, stands fair. In his domestic relations he appears to be kind and affectionate,
and in one particular, is an exception to the chiefs and warriors of his tribe. He has never
had but one wife. After his return from the campaign on the lakes, during the war with England,
his first act was to visit his family. "I then started," says he, "to visit my wife and children.
I found them well and my boys were growing finely. It is not customary for us to say much about
our women, as they generally perform their part cheerfully, and never interfere with business
belonging to the men. This is the only wife I ever had, or will ever have. She is a good woman
and teaches my boys to be brave." It is said, however, and upon pretty good authority, that
on a certain occasion, Black Hawk's vow of exclusive devotion to one wife, had well nigh been
broken. While visiting a respectable frontier settler, many years since, he became pleased
with the comely daughter of his host; and having seriously contemplated the matter, decided
in favor of the expediency of adding the pale faced beauty, to the domestic circle of his wigwam.
He accordingly expressed his wishes to the father of the young lady, and proposed to give him
a horse, in exchange for his daughter, but to his surprise the offer was declined. Some days
afterwards he returned and tendered two fine horses, but still the father refused to make the
arrangement. The old chief's love for the young lady, growing stronger, in proportion to the
difficulty of gaining her father's assent, he, subsequently, offered five or six horses for
her. But even this munificent price was rejected by the mercenary father. Black Hawk now gave
up the negociation, not a little surprised, at the high value which the white men place upon
their daughters.

It is questionable whether Black Hawk possesses any marked military talents, although during
his contest with the United States, it was common to represent him as an able warrior, who
by the eloquence and fluency of his harangues, commanded the unlimited confidence of his band.
He has, most probably, been overrated both for his eloquence and his skill in the battle field.
He is no doubt a man of courage, and seems, from early life, to have had a strong predisposition
for war. Many of his measures as a leader, have been more influenced by a sense of what was
right in the abstract, than expedient in practice. This circumstance has often placed him in
situations, inimical to the permanent prosperity of his people.

Black Hawk never made any claims to the office of a peace chief. Even as a war chief, he was
not recognized by all the tribe to which he belonged. A fragment of the Sacs and Foxes, however,
followed his banner for more than twenty years, and acknowledged him in that capacity: and,
over them, he certainly exercised, from their confidence in his judgment, his warlike talent,
or some other cause, no small amount of influence. His age and kindness of disposition, probably,
strengthened their attachment to him. In the campaign of 1832, although terminating in the
defeat of Black Hawk, and the almost entire annihilation of his band, his military reputation
did not suffer much, if the circumstances under which he was placed, be recollected. During
the operations of that period, General Atkinson estimated the warriors of Black Hawk at seven
or eight hundred, but the better opinion is that it did not, at any time, exceed five hundred;
and several persons, who had favorable opportunities for judging, place the estimate still
lower. The commander of the United States troops, had with him, in the pursuit of Black Hawk,
twenty seven hundred men, all of them well armed and most of them well mounted. This was independent
of the militia in the different military posts and fortified stations. The entire number of
the American forces, engaged in the campaign, is supposed to have approached to three thousand,
five hundred. Black Hawk was encumbered with the wives and children, the household property
and travelling equipage of his whole band; and from the time of his recrossing the Mississippi
to the battle of the Bad-axe, was constantly in want of provisions. Indeed, in the month of
July, many of his party actually starved to death. Under such circumstances, the wonder is
not, that he was finally defeated and captured, but that it should have required a campaign
of three months in which to accomplish that object. The defeat of Stillman and the attack upon
the fort at Buffalo Grove, may be claimed by Black Hawk and his band, to have been as honorable
to their arms, as were the victories of the Wisconsin and the Bad-axe to those of the United
States.

But whatever may be the ultimate opinion in regard to him, either as a warrior or a man, his
career for good and for evil, is now ended. The war-banner has passed from his hand--his seat
in the council-house is vacant--the fire of his lodge is nearly extinguished: the autumn of
life is upon him--and, in a little while the autumn leaves will rustle over the lone grave
of Black Hawk.

Since the three first editions of this work were published, the death of Black Hawk has occurred;
and a few additional particulars of his life have been collected. These, it is proposed to
embody in a new chapter.

In the course of the preceding pages, the difficulty of procuring full, and always exact information,
in regard to the lives of a people having neither records nor historians, has been alluded
to. This difficulty will be encountered by any one who may attempt to chronicle the annals
of the aborigines in their aggregate condition, or to portray their individual history. In
the compilation of this volume, much pains were taken to obtain all the prominent events in
the life of Black Hawk, and, it is supposed, as much success attended the effort, as is usual
in similar cases. Since its publication, however, it appears that all his military movements
have not been narrated, and we proceed to supply the omission.

At page 82 of this volume, it is stated that Black Hawk was only in two engagements in the
late war with Great Britain, and that the last of these was the assault upon Fort Stephenson,
in August 1813, then under the command of Major Groghan. It is true that he and his band were
with the British army in the attack upon this post, but his connection with that army did not
cease until after the capture of Fort Erie. The authority for this fact is to be found in the
"Book of the Indians," page 145. The author of that work, in narrating the incidents of Black
Hawk's return to the north-west, in 1833, after his imprisonment at Fortress Monroe, says:
"Having arrived at Buffalo, on Friday the 28th of June, they (the party returning with the
old warrior) remained there until Sunday morning. The day after their arrival, they rode over
to Black Rock, where they viewed the union of the grand canal with the lake at that place.
From this point they had a full view of the Canada shore, and Black Hawk immediately pointed
out Fort Erie, and seemed well acquainted with the adjacent country; he having been there in
the time of the last war with England, in the British service; and at the time 'when the Americans
walked into Fort Erie,' as he expressed the capture of it." Of the extent of his participation
in the events attendant upon this capture, there is no satisfactory information.

Black Hawk was likewise in the battle of the Thames, a fact not previously stated in this work,
and which is now given on the authority of a writer in the Baltimore American, to whose respectability
the editor of that paper bears testimony. We have, indeed, no reason to doubt the accuracy
of this statement, which will be read with the more interest, from the circumstance that it
embraces Black Hawk's account of the death of Tecumthe in regard to which much has been written
and published. It is not proposed, on the present occasion, to compare the relation given by
Black Hawk, of the fall of Tecumthe, with the testimony of others who have appeared as historians
of this event, but shall content ourselves with simply quoting the article to which reference
has been made. The writer professes to have been intimately acquainted with Black Hawk, and
in the brief sketch which he has presented of the life of this warrior, we find corroborating
evidence of the truth of many of the traits of character, which, in the course of this volume,
has been assigned to him both as a man and a warrior. The article is in these words:

"MESSRS. EDITORS--Hearing of the death of the celebrated Sauk chieftain, BLACK HAWK, I am induced
to make you the following communication, which may be interesting to some of your readers.

"During a residence of several years in what is now the Territory of Iowa, I had many opportunities
of seeing and conversing with this noted warrior, and often look back with feelings of great
pleasure to the many tokens of good will and friendship that he has frequently bestowed upon
me. His lodge was always open to a stranger, and he was ever ready to share that with him which
he might most want, either his furs and blankets for a couch, or his corn and venison for a
repast. He always spoke in terms of high regard of the whites, saying, that in war he fought
like a brave man, but in peace he wished to forget that his hand had ever been raised against
them. His career as a warrior commenced at a very early age; when he was but fourteen years
old, his father, Pawheese, led a war party against the Osages, in which expedition he accompanied
him. They succeeded in reaching the village of Osages, which they attacked, and after a very
severe encounter, they routed their enemies and burnt their town. In this battle Black Hawk's
father was killed, but he revenged his death by killing and scalping the Osage who had slain
him. He was fond of recounting his earlier exploits, and often boasted of his being at the
right hand of Tecumthe, when the latter was killed at the battle of the Thames. His account
of the death of this distinguished warrior, was related to me by himself, during an evening
that I spent in his lodge some winters ago. In the course of our talk, I asked him if he was
with Tecumthe when he was killed. He replied--

"'I was, and I will now tell you all about it.--Tecumthe, Shaubinne, and Caldwell, two Potawattimie
chiefs, and myself, were seated on a log near our camp fire, filling our pipes for a smoke,
on the morning of the battle, when word came from the British general, that he wished to speak
with Tecumthe. He went immediately, and after staying some time rejoined us, taking his seat
without saying a word, when Caldwell, who was one of his favorites, observed to him, 'my father,
what are we to do? Shall we fight the Americans?' 'Yes, my son,' replied Tecumthe, 'We shall
go into their very smoke--but you are now wanted by the General. Go, my son, I never expect
to see you again.' Shortly after this, (continued Black Hawk,) the Indian spies came in, and
gave word of the near approach of the Americans. I asked him if he had ever fought against
the whites after the death of Tecumthe. He said not--that he returned home to his village on
the Mississippi, at the mouth of Rock River, and there he remained until driven away by the
whites, in the year 1832. The wish to hold possession of this village, was the cause of the
war which he waged against the whites during that year. He told me that he never wished to
fight; that he was made to do so; that the whites killed his warriors when they went with a
white flag to beg a parley, and that after this was done, he thought they intended to kill
him at all events, and therefore he would die like a warrior.

"In speaking of his defeat, he said it was what he expected; that he did not mind it; but what
hurt him more than any thing else, was our government degrading him in the eyes of his own
people, and setting another chief (KEOKUK) over him. This degradation he appeared to feel very
sensibly, still he continued to possess all his native pride. One instance that came under
my observation, I recollect well, in which it was strongly displayed. He happened to be in
a small town in Iowa, on the same day in which a party of dragoons, under Captain ---- arrived:
and in paying a visit to a friend with whom he always partook of a meal, whenever he stopped
at the village, he met with the Captain, who had been invited to dine. Black Hawk remained,
also expecting the usual invitation to stay and eat with them: but when the dinner was ready,
the host took him aside, and told him the Captain, or rather the white man's chief, was to
dine with him that day, and he must wait until they had finished. The old chief's eye glistened
with anger as he answered him, raising the fore-finger of one hand to his breast, to represent
the officer, 'I know the white man is a chief, but I,' elevating the finger of the other hand
far above his head, 'was a chief, and led my warriors to the fight, long before his mother
knew him. Your meat,--my dogs should not eat it!' Saying this, he gathered the folds of his
blanket about him, and stalked off, looking as proudly as if he still walked over ground that
he could call 'my own.'

"Black Hawk possessed, to a great degree, one fine trait which it is not usual for us to concede
to the Indian--kindness and affection for his wife. He never had but one, and with her he lived
for upwards of forty years; they had several children, three of whom still survive, two sons
and a daughter. The eldest son is now one of the most promising young braves of the nation,
and bids fair to be one of its most noble men. The daughter is still quite young, and is considered
to be the most beautiful maiden belonging to her tribe.

"He has now departed on his long journey, to join those of his people who have gone before
him to their happy hunting grounds, far beyond the setting sun. May the Great Spirit grant
him a clear sunshine, and a smooth path."

For the particulars, given below, of the last days and death of Black Hawk, we are indebted
to a highly respectable gentleman, W. Henry Starr, Esq. of Burlington, Iowa Territory. His
communication, under date of March 21st, 1839, is given entire, that the interest of the narrative
may be preserved.

"Your letter of the 2nd of January came to hand in due course of mail, in which you make some
enquiries concerning the old chief of the Sac and Fox tribes--the venerable BLACK HAWK. I should
have replied to it sooner, could I have done so satisfactorily either to you or myself. I knew
much by report of the old chief, and something from personal acquaintance; but my knowledge
was not so accurate as to be serviceable to a faithful biographer. I have, therefore, taken
sometime to make the necessary enquiries, and satisfy myself of their accuracy.

"After Black Hawk's last return from the eastern states, he passed the winter of 1837-8 in
the county of Lee, in the south-eastern portion of this territory, on a small stream called
Devil-creek. The white settlements extended for forty miles west of him, and the tribe to which
he belonged, with the exception of a few old braves, and his family, resided on the frontier.
From his tribe he was isolated in position and feeling. His family consisted of a wife, two
sons, Nasheaskuk and Samesett, (as they are pronounced here,) a daughter and her husband. They
passed their time principally in hunting deer, wild turkies, and the prairie hen, which are
abundant in that quarter of the territory. For hunting, Black Hawk is said to have displayed
no fondness; but chose to spend his time in improving his place of residence, and exercising
his ingenuity with mechanic tools. In the spring of 1838, they removed to the frontier, and
settled upon the Des Moines river, about eighty or ninety miles from its mouth, near to a trading
post, and in the immediate vicinity of the villages of the other chiefs of the tribe. Here
he had a very comfortable bark cabin, which he furnished in imitation of the whites, with chairs,
a table, a mirror, and mattrasses. His dress was that of the other chiefs, with the exception
of a broad-brimmed black hat, which he usually wore. In the summer he cultivated a few acres
of land in corn, melons, and various kinds of vegetables. He was frequently visited by the
whites, and I have often heard his hospitality highly commended.

"On the 4th of July last, he was present at Fort Madison, in Lee county, by special invitation,
and was the most conspicuous guest of the citizens assembled in commemoration of that day.
Among the toasts called forth by the occasion was the following:

"'Our illustrious guest, Black Hawk.--May his declining years be as calm and serene as his
previous life has been boisterous and full of warlike incidents. His attachment and present
friendship to his white brethren, fully entitle him to a seat at our festive board.'

"So soon as this sentiment was drank, Black Hawk arose and delivered the following speech,
which was taken down at the time by two interpreters, and by them furnished for publication.

"'It has pleased the Great Spirit that I am here to-day--I have eaten with my white friends.
The earth is our mother--we are now on it--with the Great Spirit above us--It is good. I hope
we are all friends here. A few winters ago I was fighting against you--I did wrong, perhaps;
but that is past--it is buried--let it be forgotten.

"'Rock river was a beautiful country--I liked my towns, my cornfields, and the home of my people.
I fought for it. It is now yours--keep it as we did--it will produce you good crops.

"'I thank the Great Spirit that I am now friendly with my white brethren--we are here together--we
have eaten together--we are friends--it is his wish and mine. I thank you for your friendship.

"'I was once a great warrior--I am now poor. Keokuk has been the cause of my present situation--but
do not attach blame to him. I am now old. I have looked upon the Mississippi since I have been
a child. I love the Great River. I have dwelt upon its banks from the time I was an infant.
I look upon it now. I shake hands with you, and as it is my wish, I hope you are my friends.'

"In the course of the day he was prevailed upon to drink several times, and became somewhat
intoxicated, an uncommon circumstance, as he was generally temperate.

"In the autumn of 1838, he was at the house of an Indian trader, in the vicinity of Burlington,
when I became acquainted and frequently conversed with him, in broken English, and through
the medium of gestures and pantomime. A deep seated melancholy was apparent in his countenance
and conversation. He endeavored to make me comprehend, on one occasion, his former greatness;
and represented that he was once master of the country, east, north, and south of us--that
he had been a very successful warrior,--called himself, smiting his breast, 'big Captain Black
Hawk,' 'nesso Kaskaskias,' (killed the Kaskaskias,) 'nesso Sioux a heap,' (killed a great number
of Sioux.) He then adverted to the ingratitude of his tribe, in permitting Keokuk to supersede
him, who, he averred, excelled him in nothing but drinking whiskey.

"Toward Keokuk he felt the most unrelenting hatred. Keokuk was, however, beyond his influence,
being recognized as chief of the tribe, by the government of the United States. He unquestionably
possesses talents of the first order, excels as an orator, but his authority will probably
be short-lived on account of his dissipation, and his profligacy in spending the money paid
him for the benefit of his tribe; and which he squanders upon himself and a few favorites,
through whose influence he seeks to maintain his authority.

"You enquire if Black Hawk was at the battle of the Thames? On one occasion I mentioned Tecumthe
to him, and he expressed the greatest joy that I had heard of him: and pointing away to the
east, and making a feint, as if aiming a gun, said, 'Chemokaman (white man) nesso,' (kill.)
From which I had no doubt of his being personally acquainted with Tecumthe; and I have been
since informed, on good authority, that he was in the battle of the Thames and in several other
engagements with that distinguished chief.

"Soon after this interview with Black Hawk, he set out for the frontier, where a payment was
soon to be made to the tribe, of a portion of their annuity.

"The weather was both hot and wet, and it is supposed, that, on this journey, he imbibed the
seeds of the disease which soon after terminated his existence. This journey was in September.
Early in October, the commissioner for adjusting claims with the Sac and Fox tribes, was to
meet them at Rock Island, and most of the Indians were there on the first of that month. Black
Hawk was taken sick and was unable to accompany them. A violent bilious fever had seized upon
him, and on the 3d of October, after an illness of seven days, he died. His only medical attendant
was one of the tribe, who knew something of vegetable antidotes, and was called doctor. His
wife, who was devotedly attached to him, mourned deeply during his illness. She seemed to have
had a presentiment of his approaching death, and said, some days before it occurred, 'he is
getting old--he must die--Monotah calls him home.'

"After his death, he was dressed in the uniform presented to him at Washington, by the President
or Secretary at War, and placed upon a rude bier, consisting of two poles with bark laid across,
on which he was carried by four of his braves to the place of interment, followed by his family
and about fifty of the tribe, (the chiefs being all absent.) They seemed deeply affected, and
mourned in their usual way, shaking hands, and muttering in guttural tones, prayers to Monotah
(their deity) for his safe passage to the land prepared for the reception of all Indians. The
grave was six feet deep and of the usual length, situated upon a little eminence about fifty
yards from his wigwam. The body was placed in the middle of the grave, in a sitting posture,
upon a seat, constructed for the purpose. On his left side the cane given him, as I am informed,
by Mr. Henry Clay, was placed upright, with his right hand resting upon it. Many of the old
warrior's trophies were placed in the grave, and some Indian garments, together with his favorite
weapons. The grave was then covered with plank, and a mound of earth, several feet in height,
was thrown up over it, and the whole enclosed with pickets twelve feet in height. At the head
of the grave a flag staff was placed, bearing our national banner; and at the foot there stands
a post, on which is inscribed, in Indian characters, his age.

"I do not know the exact age of Black Hawk, but understood from him, that he was seventy-two.
His virtues commanded the respect of all the whites who knew him. He possessed much magnanimity
of soul, and under all the mortifications to which he has been subjected, and the insults that
have been heaped upon him by his tribe, and especially by the haughty Keokuk, he maintained,
until the last years of his life, a uniform cheerfulness and resignation of mind, which bespoke
a conscious superiority."

       *       *       *       *       *

With this sketch of the last days of Black Hawk, our narrative of his life is closed. After
an eventful and restless career of "three score and ten years," this celebrated Sac has been
"gathered to his fathers." His name cannot be forgotten, for his deeds are a part of the history
of this country. If not distinguished for a high order of talent, or renowned for great warlike
achievements, he has not often been surpassed in the history of his race, for those less dazzling
virtues, humanity, courage, and love of country. The love of country is not confined to civilized
life, but swells the heart and nerves the arm of the untutored man of the woods. "I LIKED MY
TOWNS, MY CORNFIELDS, AND THE HOME OF MY PEOPLE;--I FOUGHT FOR IT," should be inscribed over
the humble grave of Black Hawk.

NOTE.--Since writing that portion of the foregoing narrative which treats of the causes of
the late war with the Sacs and Foxes, the following article, from the able pen of judge Hall,
has met our observation. It was published in the Western Monthly Magazine in 1833, one year
after the termination of that conflict. The writer was then a resident of Illinois, and intimately
acquainted with the relations existing between the whites and Indians. His remarks are valuable.
They embrace a graphic description of the region inhabited by the Sacs and Foxes, and fully
sustain the position which we have taken in this volume, that the "Black Hawk war" was the
result of unprovoked agressions made by the American people upon the Indians.

     "I have just returned from a delightful voyage. I have explored a
     portion of the exquisitely beautiful shores of the upper
     Mississippi; and am ready to confess that until now, I had little
     idea of the extent, the grandeur, or the resources of the west. The
     world cannot produce such another country as this great valley of
     ours. Yet to understand its value, one must ascend the Mississippi
     and the Illinois, and see the noble prairies of the two states
     which are destined to eclipse all others. I cannot convey to you in
     adequate language, my admiration of this attractive region. The
     traveller who visits the western country, and fancies he has
     acquired any knowledge of it--I say any, by simply tracing the
     meanders of the Ohio, or spending weeks, or years, if you please,
     at Cincinnati or Louisville, is very much mistaken. There is much
     to admire in western Pennsylvania and Virginia; Kentucky and Ohio
     are full of attraction; but the man who is really an admirer of
     nature, and would witness the most splendid exhibitions of the
     creative power, must go to Illinois and Missouri.

     "I visited this region for the first time four years ago, while the
     Sacs and Foxes were at peace with the whites, and before Black Hawk
     had got to be a great man. They were friendly and well-disposed,
     and the white people residing near them, would almost as soon have
     distrusted or disturbed each other, as those peaceful red men. I
     took great interest in noticing their dwellings, and remarking
     their deportment, as it was the first occasion I had ever enjoyed
     of seeing the savage in his own wild home. I had embarked on board
     a steamboat at St. Louis, intending to take a pleasant excursion
     to the falls of St. Anthony. The weather was very delightful, only
     a little too warm; and the river was unfortunately so low, that on
     arriving at the Des Moines rapids, we found it difficult to
     ascend them, and above that point, our progress was continually
     impeded by the difficulty of the navigation. This circumstance,
     though vexatious to such of the passengers as had business ahead,
     or families at home, was not disagreeable to one who, like myself,
     travelled only for amusement, as it afforded opportunities of
     exploring the romantic shores. We spent a day at the Lower Rapids,
     and I have seldom seen a more attractive country. The land is high
     on both sides, and rises gradually in beautiful swells. I saw
     hundreds of acres covered with the native buckeye, the most
     beautiful tree of the forest--if, indeed, any can be entitled to
     that distinction among so great a variety of noble and majestic
     trees. Beneath, was a rich undergrowth of wild gooseberry bushes.
     Add to these the beautiful creeper, and the wild honeysuckle, which
     were occasionally seen, and it is impossible to imagine a
     vegetation more splendidly luxuriant and ornamental. The whole
     country is based on rock, and the springs which burst out from the
     hill sides are clear as crystal and delightfully cold. The shores
     of the river are plentifully strewed with crystalizations and
     petrifactions. We picked up some fine specimens of cornelian, and
     saw a vast number of geodes of every size, from one inch in
     diameter to fifteen.

     "It was Sunday. Have you ever experienced the singular and pleasing
     associations connected with a sabbath passed in the wilderness? I
     have often enjoyed these feelings, but never felt them with such
     force as on this day. It was calm and sultry. The brilliant
     sunbeams were brightly reflected from the broad bosom of the
     Mississippi, and the deep green outline of the forest was
     splendidly illumined, while the deep shadows underneath the foliage
     afforded an attractive appearance of coolness and seclusion. The
     passengers and crew were scattered about singly or in small
     parties, so that when I wandered but a small distance from the
     vessel, and seated myself on a hill which commanded a view of the
     river and its banks, I found myself perfectly alone. Not a living
     object was visible, not a sound was heard, not a leaf or a limb
     stirred. How different from the streets of a city upon a sabbath
     morn, when crowds of well-dressed persons are seen moving in every
     direction; when the cheerful bells are sounding, and the beautiful
     smiling children are hurrying in troops to Sunday school! Here I
     was in solitude. I saw not the laborer resting from toil, nor the
     smile of infancy, nor the christian bowing before his God; but
     Nature proclaimed a sabbath by the silence that reigned abroad, and
     the splendor with which she had adorned her works.

     "It is natural that these recollections of my first visit to the
     frontier should mingle with the observations made in my recent tour
     through the same scenes; I shall therefore not attempt to separate
     the remarks made on either occasion, but give some of the results
     of both voyages.

     "I can scarcely describe the sensations with which I first saw the
     solitary lodge of an Indian hunter, on the shore of the
     Mississippi. In my childhood I had read with thrilling interest,
     the tales of border warfare; but I had not learned to hate an
     Indian with mortal hatred. I verily believe they have souls. People
     may think differently in certain places, which shall be nameless,
     but I cannot be persuaded to the contrary. You cannot imagine any
     thing more frail than an Indian wigwam--a mere shelter of poles and
     mats, so small, so apparently inadequate to any purpose of
     security or comfort, that it is hardly possible to believe it to be
     intended for the residence of human beings. In such habitations
     reside the Indian warrior, whose name is a terror to his enemies;
     and the dark maiden, whose story supplies the poet with rich
     materials, with which to embellish the page of fiction. In such
     wretched hovels reside the aboriginal lords of the soil.

     "I have seen in this region, evidences of persecution perpetrated
     by our people upon this unhappy race, such as the American people
     would scarcely believe; and I am satisfied that if the events of
     the late war could be traced to their true source, every real
     philanthropist in the nation would blush for his country.

            *       *       *       *       *

     "I could relate many anecdotes, to show the friendly feelings
     entertained towards our government and people by the Sacs--feelings
     which, whether of fear or of kindness, have rendered them wholly
     submissive, and which nothing but the most unprovoked aggression on
     our side, could have kindled into hostility. I will only, at this
     time, repeat one, which occurred during my first voyage, reserving
     others for a future letter.

     "One day, when the boat stopped to take in wood, some of us
     strolled up to the house of a Mr. D., a respectable farmer from
     Pennsylvania. He had been living here several years, at a spot
     distant from any settlements, and without a single neighbor. Upon
     our inquiring whether he felt no alarm in residing thus alone in
     the vicinity of the Indians, he replied that his family had
     formerly experienced much uneasiness, but that they had long since
     become satisfied that there was no ground for apprehension. He was
     convinced that the Sacs, their nearest neighbors, so far from being
     disposed to injure the whites, were cautious and timid of giving
     offence. In support of this opinion, he related the following
     anecdote.

     "His house stands on a high bank of the Mississippi, and the family
     were one day much alarmed by discovering a large number of Indians
     passing up the river in canoes. They passed along in a most
     disorderly manner, some paddling their little vessels, and others
     strolling along the shore, but the majority evidently intoxicated.
     It was the latter circumstance which caused alarm. The Indians had
     been to St. Louis to receive their annuities, and had procured a
     sufficient supply of whisky to render them unsafe visitors. They
     continued, however, straggling along in larger or smaller parties
     all day, without stopping. At night, one of them, a young warrior
     of prepossessing appearance, came to the house, and in the most
     respectful manner, asked permission to sleep upon the floor of the
     cabin. Mr. D., although by no means pleased with his guest, knew
     not how to refuse. The Indian warrior was invited to supper. A
     plentiful meal, such as composed the ordinary repast of the family,
     was placed before him, and having satisfied his hunger, he wrapped
     himself in his blanket, threw himself on the floor before the fire,
     and went to sleep. In the course of the night, Mr. D. happening to
     go out, discovered some Indians lying in the bushes not far from
     the house; without disturbing them, he proceeded in a different
     direction, where he found another party; they were strewed, in
     short, entirely around his dwelling. The fact of being thus
     surrounded, the concealment, and the silence of the Indians, all
     conspired to awaken suspicion, and he passed the night in no small
     degree of uneasiness. He rose early in the morning; his Indian
     guest also started up, gathered his blanket around him, and took
     leave; first, however, explaining to Mr. D. that he belonged to a
     party of Sacs who were returning from St. Louis, and that many of
     them being intoxicated, it had been thought proper to station a
     guard round Mr. D.'s house, to protect him and his property from
     injury. He added, that if any depredation should be discovered to
     have been committed by the Indians, the chiefs would pay Mr. D. the
     full amount. Such an example of the care taken by the chiefs of
     this tribe to avoid giving umbrage to the whites, affords the
     highest testimony, either of their friendship for our people, or
     their respect for our power.

     "The Sac and Fox tribe inhabited, at that time, a beautiful tract
     of country in Illinois, upon the borders of Rock river. These two
     tribes are usually mentioned in conjunction; because the Foxes,
     many years ago, having been nearly exterminated in a war with some
     of their neighbors, the remnant of the nation, too feeble to exist
     as a separate tribe, sought refuge in the Sac villages, and have
     remained ever since incorporated with the latter people. They are a
     fine looking race of people, and are well disposed towards the
     whites. They have long been divided, however, into two parties, one
     of which is friendly towards our government, while the other,
     called the British band, is under the influence of the British
     traders. It has always been the policy of the latter, to keep the
     Indians upon the western frontier in a state of disaffection
     towards the American people, and by these means, to secure to
     themselves an undue proportion of the fur trade. So long as it
     should remain difficult upon our part to gain access to the tribes,
     and our intercourse with them be liable to interruption, jealousy,
     and distrust, so long would the British trader possess an advantage
     over us in relation to this traffic. The British fur companies,
     whose agents are numerous, intelligent, and enterprising, have
     always acted upon this policy, and the English officers in Canada,
     both civil and military, have given it their sanction. Almost all
     the atrocities which have been committed on our frontiers by the
     Indians, within the last fifty years, have been directly or
     indirectly incited by the incendiary agents of that mercenary
     government. The British band of the Sacs and Foxes have been in
     the habit of visiting Malden annually, and receiving valuable
     presents--presents, which being made to a disaffected portion of a
     tribe residing not only within the United States, but within the
     limits of a state, could be viewed in no other light than as
     bribes,--the wages of disaffection. Black Hawk, though not a chief,
     is one of the most influential individuals of the British band."

       *       *       *       *       *

In a late number of the American Museum, we find the following article. It bears intrinsic
evidence of coming from the same pen, and presents in a striking point of view the rapid extension
of our settlements, and the consequent recession of the Indians.

     Most of our readers have become familiarly acquainted with the
     name of the redoubted Black Hawk, whose adventures are detailed in
     this volume and whose fame has been spread from Maine to Florida.
     There was a time when he shared the eager attention of the public
     with Fanny Kemble and the cholera, and was one of the lions of the
     day; and as regularly talked about as the weather, the last new
     novel, or the candidates for the presidency. The war in Illinois,
     though of brief duration, and not marked by any stirring events,
     came suddenly upon us after a long series of peaceful years upon
     the northwestern border. The savages, weary of fruitless conflicts,
     or quelled by the superior numbers of a gigantic and growing foe,
     seemed to have submitted to their fate, and the pioneer had ceased
     to number the war-whoop among the inquietudes of the border life.
     The plains of Illinois and Missouri were rapidly becoming peopled
     by civilized men. A race less hardy than the backwoodsmen were
     tempted by the calm to migrate to those delightful solitudes, that
     bloomed with more than Arcadian fascinations of fruitfulness and
     beauty. The smoke of the settler's cabin began to ascend from the
     margin of every stream in that wide region, and the cattle strayed
     through rich pastures, of which the buffalo, the elk, and the deer,
     had long enjoyed a monopoly--an unchartered monopoly--wondering, no
     doubt, at their good luck in having their lives cast in such
     pleasant places.

     It was the writer's lot to ramble over that beautiful country while
     these interesting scenes were presented; while the wilderness still
     glowed in its pristine luxuriance: while the prairie-grass and the
     wild flowers still covered the plain, and the deer continued to
     frequent his ancient haunts, and while the habitations of the new
     settlers were so widely and so thinly scattered, that the nearest
     neighbors could scarcely have exchanged the courtesy of an annual
     visit without the aid of the seven-leagued boots of ancient story.
     But though in solitude, they lived without fear. There were none to
     molest nor make them afraid. If they had few friends, they had no
     enemies. If the Indian halted at the settler's door, it was to
     solicit hospitality, not to offer violence. But more frequently he
     stalked silently by, timid of giving offence to the white man, whom
     he doubtless regarded as an intruder upon his own ancient heritage,
     but whose possession he had been taught to respect, because he had
     ever found it guarded by a strong and swift arm, that had never
     failed to repay aggression with ten-fold vengeance. Suddenly,
     however, a change came over this cheering scene. The misconduct of
     a few white men disturbed the harmony of a wide region. The Indians
     were oppressed and insulted to the last point of forbearance, and a
     small but restless band, regarded as insubordinate and troublesome
     even by their own nation, seized upon the occasion to rush to war.

     It is wonderful to look back upon this eventful history. The
     country over which Black Hawk, with a handful of followers, badly
     armed, and destitute of stores or munitions of war, roamed for
     hundreds of miles, driving off the scattered inhabitants, is now
     covered with flourishing settlements, with substantial houses, and
     large farms--not with the cabins and clearings of bordermen--but
     with the comfortable dwellings and the well-tilled fields of
     independent farmers. Organized counties and all the subordination
     of social life are there; and there are the noisy school-house, the
     decent church, the mill, the country store, the fat ox, and the
     sleek plough-horse. The yankee is there with his notions and his
     patent-rights, and the travelling agent with his subscription book;
     there are merchandise from India and from England, and, in short,
     all the luxuries of life, from Bulwer's last novel down to
     Brandreth's pills. And all this has been done in six years--in less
     than half the time of Jacob's courtship. In 1832 the Saukie
     warriors ranged over that fertile region, which is now (1838)
     covered with an industrious population; while the Territories of
     Wisconsin and Iowa, and vast settlements in Missouri, have since
     grown up, beyond the region which was then the frontier and the
     seat of war.

APPENDIX.

SKETCHES OF THE SIOUX.

The Sioux or Dacotas, are a numerous, powerful and warlike nation of Indians, who have been
appropriately called the Arabs of the west. Between them and the Sacs and Foxes, there has
existed, from the settlement of the two latter tribes on the waters of the Mississippi, a hostility
of feeling that has kept them embroiled in a constant warfare. The efforts of government to
break down their prejudices and make peace between them, have failed in accomplishing that
benevolent end. It is not, however, against the Sacs and Foxes alone, that their arms are turned.
From time immemorial they have been at war with the Chippeways, and are also constantly making
hostile incursions upon other neighboring tribes. They usually fight on horseback, and being
very superior horsemen, they are generally more than a match for their antagonists. In Schoolcraft's
Narrative, we find the following account of their numbers, habits and peculiarities of character.

"The numerical strength of the Sioux nation was stated by the late General Pike at 21,675,
three thousand eight hundred of whom are warriors. This is the most powerful Indian tribe in
North America. It consists of seven bands, namely the Minokantongs, the Yengetongs, the Sissitongs,
the Wahpetongs, the Titongs, the Mendewacantongs and the Washpecontongs. These are independent
bands under their own chiefs, but united in a confederacy for the protection of their territories;
and send deputies to a general council of the chiefs and warriors, whenever the concerns of
their nation require it. If one of the tribes is attacked, the others are expected to assist
in the repulsion of the enemy. They inhabit all the country, between the Mississippi and Missouri
rivers, from north latitude about 46° to the junction of these rivers near St. Louis, with
trifling exceptions in favor of some scattered bands of Foxes, Sacs and Kickapoos. Their country
also extends south of the Missouri, where the principal part of the Titongs reside, and east
of the Mississippi to the territories of the Chippeways--the Winnebagoes and the Menominies.
The greatest chief of the nation at present (1820) is Talangamane, or the Red Wing.

"The Minocantongs, or people of the waters, are located at St. Peters, and along the banks
of the Mississippi towards Prairie du Chien. They reside in four principal villages.

"The Yengetongs and the Sessitongs inhabit the upper parts of the river St. Peters, and are
sometimes called the Sioux of the plains. Their traffic is principally in Buffalo robes. The
Wahpetongs, or people of the leaves are the most erratic in their dispositions of all the Sioux;
they inhabit the St. Peters between the Prairie de Francois and the White Rock, during a part
of the year, and generally go out to hunt above the falls of St. Anthony towards the sources
of the river De Corbeau, and upon the plains which give origin to the Crow, Sac and Elk rivers.

"The Titongs inhabit both banks of the Missouri, and rove in quest of game over an immense
extent of country. They are said to be related to the Mahas, and some other bands south of
the Missouri.

"The Mendewacantongs, or people of the Medicine Lake, the Washpecontongs, or people of the
Leaves, who have run away, and some other scattered bands, whose names are unknown, inhabit
the country generally, from St. Peters south to the mouth of the Missouri, and are chiefly
located upon the sources of the rivers Ocano, Iowa, and Desmoines.

"The Sioux are generally represented as a brave, generous and spirited people, with proud notions
of their origin as a tribe, and their superiority as hunters and warriors, and with a predominant
passion for war. They speak the Narcotah language, which is peculiar to themselves, and appears
to have little affinity with any other Indian tongue. It is not so soft and sonorous as the
Algonquin which abounds in labials, but more so than the Winnebago, which is the most harsh
and guttural language in America. The Narcotah sounds to an English ear, like the Chinese,
and both in this, and in other respects, the Sioux are thought to present many points of coincidence.
It is certain that their manners and customs differ essentially from those of any other tribe,
and their physiognomy, as well as their language, and opinions, mark them a distinct race of
people. Their sacrifices and their supplications to the unknown God--their feasts after any
signal deliverance from danger--their meat, and their burnt offerings--the preparation of incense,
and certain customs of their females, offer too striking a coincidence, with the manners of
the Asiatic tribes, before the commencement of the Christian era, to escape observation, while
their paintings and hieroglyphics bear so much analogy to those of the Asteeks of Mexico, as
to render it probable that the latter are of Naudowessian origin."

"From my knowledge of the Sioux nation," observes Lieutenant Pike, "I do not hesitate to pronounce
them the most warlike and independent nation of Indians, within the boundaries of the United
States, their every passion being subservient to that of war. Their guttural pronunciation,
high cheek bones, their visages, and distinct manners, together with their own traditions,
supported by the testimony of neighboring nations, put it in my mind beyond a shadow of doubt,
that they have emigrated from the north west point of America, to which they had come across
the narrow streights, which in that quarter divide the two continents; and are absolutely descendants
of a Tartarean tribe."

The following anecdote of a Sioux chief, and of a council held by Governor Cass, some years
since, for the purpose of making peace between the Sioux and Chippeways, is drawn from a letter
from that officer, to the war department.[16]

"Some years since, mutually weary of hostilities, the chiefs of both nations met, and agreed
upon a truce. But the Sioux disregarding the solemn compact they had formed, and actuated by
some sudden impulse attacked and murdered a number of Chippeways. The old Chippeway chief was
present at the time, and his life was saved by the intrepidity and self-devotion of a Sioux
chief. This man intreated, remonstrated, threatened. He adjured his countrymen, by every motive,
to abstain from any violation of their faith: and finding his remonstrances useless, he attached
himself to the Chippeway chief, and avowed his determination to save him or perish. Awed by
such intrepidity, the Sioux finally agreed that he should ransom the Chippewa. This he did
at the expense of all the property he possessed. The Sioux chief now accompanied him on his
journey, until he considered him safe from any of the parties of the Sioux, who might be disposed
to pursue him.

"Believing it equally inconsistent with humanity and sound policy, that these border contests
should be suffered to continue; and feeling that the Indians have a full portion of moral and
physical evils, without adding to them the calamities of a war, which had no definite object,
Governor Cass being at Sandy lake, offered his mediation to the Chippeway chiefs, to which
they readily acceded. In consequence, a deputation of ten of their men descended the Mississippi
with him.

"The Chippeways landed occasionally, to examine whether any of the Sioux had recently visited
that quarter. In one of these excursions, there was found, suspended to a tree, in an exposed
situation, a piece of birch-bark, made flat, by being fastened between two sticks, about eighteen
inches long by fifteen broad. This bark contained the answer of the Sioux nation, to overtures
which the Chippeways had made, on Governor Cass' offer of mediation:--which overtures had been
found and taken off by a party of the Sioux. So revengeful and sanguinary had the contest been
between these tribes, that no personal communication could take place. Neither the sanctity
of the office, nor the importance of the message, could protect the ambassador of either party
from the vengeance of the other.

"The preliminaries to a peace being thus settled, the Sioux and Chippeways met in joint council--smoked
the pipe of peace together, and then in their own figurative language, 'buried the tomahawk
so deep, that it could never be dug up again.'"

Another anecdote is related by Mr. Schoolcraft which we quote as illustrative of the character,
in some degree, of this singular and warlike race."

"Le Petit Corbeau, a chief of a small band of Sioux, located upon the banks of the Mississippi,
towards the confines of the Chippeway territory, going out one morning to examine his beaver
trap, found a Sauteur in the act of stealing it. He had approached without exciting alarm,
and while the Sauteur was engaged in taking the trap from the water, he stood maturely surveying
him with a loaded rifle in his hands. As the two nations were at war, and the offence was in
itself one of the most heinous nature, he would have been justified in killing him on the spot,
and the thief looked for nothing else, on finding himself detected. But the Sioux chief walking
up to him discovered a nobleness of disposition which would have done honor to the most enlightened
of men. 'Take no alarm,' said he, 'at my approach; I only come to present to you the trap of
which I see you stand in need. You are entirely welcome to it. Take my gun also, as I perceive
you have none of your own, and depart with it to the land of your countrymen, but linger not
here, lest some of my young men, who are panting for the blood of their enemies, should discover
your footsteps in our country, and fall upon you.' So saying he delivered him his gun and accoutrements,
and returned unarmed to the village of which he is so deservedly the chief."

COLONIZATION OF THE INDIANS.

The plan, now in progress of execution, for the removal of all the Indians, within the limits
of the United States, to a region of country west of Missouri and Arkansas, will of course,
when carried out, greatly modify our relations with them. New laws must be enacted by Congress,
and new treaties formed between the Indians and the United States.

From the organization of the federal government to the present time, our relations with the
Indians have been the subject of frequent legislation, and the statute book bears many evidences
of benevolent action towards this ill-fated race. If the laws enacted by Congress for the protection
and civilization of the aborigines of this country, had been regularly and rigidly enforced,
and a more impartial interpretation of the treaties made with them, had been observed, their
condition would have been far better than it now is--they would have passed from the hunter
to the pastoral state, and have grown in numbers, virtue and intelligence. But these laws and
these treaties, have been year after year violated by our own people, and the result has been
a constant deterioration of the Indians. This is especially true of those laws intended to
prevent our citizens from hunting on the Indian lands, residing in their country, and trading
with them without a license from the United States. These have generally been a dead letter
upon the national statute book, and the encroachments of the lawless frontiers-men, the trader,
the land speculator, and the vender of spirituous liquors, have impoverished degraded, and
vitiated, more or less, every tribe within the limits of the United States. It is to this intercourse,
with these classes of persons, that the bad faith, the savage barbarities, and border-wars,
of which so much complaint is made against the Indians, are to be mainly attributed. The rapacity
of our people, for their peltries and their land, the feeble execution of laws made for their
protection, and the loose morality which has governed our general intercourse with them, have
wasted their numbers, debased their character, and tarnished the honor of that nation, which,
from the very organization of its government, has claimed to be their benevolent protector.

The plan of removing the Indians beyond the limits of the United States is not new. If not
original with Mr. Jefferson, it was commended by him, and has been approved, we believe, by
each successive administration since his day. It looked of course to a peaceable not a forcible
removal of them. Whether the details of the original plan corresponded with those of the law,
under which this removal is going on, we do not know.

The substance of the present plan may be gathered from the following provisions:

1st. To secure the lands on which they are placed to the several tribes by patent, with only
such restrictions as are necessary to prevent white men from purchasing them, or encroaching
upon them.

2d. To establish a territorial government, all the offices of which, (except those of the governor
and secretary,) are to be filled with Indians, wherever competent natives can be obtained.

3d. To provide for a general council of delegates, chosen by and from the tribes, with legislative
powers; their enactments not to be valid till they have been approved by the President of the
United States.

4th. To have a delegate, always a native, remain at Washington, during the sessions of Congress,
to attend to the affairs of the territory, who shall be allowed the pay and emoluments of a
member of Congress.

5th. To encourage, by liberal annual payments of money provided for in treaties, the establishment
of schools and colleges; in which competent native teachers are always to be preferred when
they can be had.

The power and influence of the United States are to be directed in protecting them from the
whites; in preserving peace among the different tribes, and in stimulating them, by rewards
and emoluments, in acquiring the habits of civilized life. The efforts of the benevolent to
carry christianity among them, if made in conformity with the regulations of the territory,
are to be cherished. These are the leading features of the new system of Indian regulations,
established by government for the civilization of the Indians. The territory set apart for
this object, lies west of the states of Arkansas and Missouri, running north from the Red river
about six hundred miles, and west from the western boundaries of these states about two hundred
miles. The number of Indians within the territory of the United States is estimated to approach
to near half a million of souls.

It must be obvious to every one familiar with the Indian character, and with the history of
our past relations with this people, that the success of this plan, will depend, in a very
great degree, upon the manner in which its details shall be executed by the government. A failure
will inevitably ensue, if white men are permitted to come in contact with the Indians. The
strong arm of the military power of the United States, will be requisite to stay the encroachments
of our people, whose love of adventure and whose thirst for gain, will carry them among the
Indians, unless arrested by more cogent considerations than a sense of duty, or the prohibitions
of the statute book.

Instead of attempting to supply them with goods by licensing traders to reside among them,
they should be encouraged to sell their furs and peltries and to make their purchases in the
United States. On the former system they are liable to constant imposition, and the very articles
which the traders carry among them, are worthless in kind and poor in quality; but if the Indians
traded with us, within the limits of the United States, they would have the competition arising
from a number of buyers and sellers, they would obtain better prices for their furs and procure
more valuable articles, upon fairer terms, in exchange. They would also be benefitted by observing
our manners and customs, adopting our style of dress, learning the value of property, and gaining
some knowledge of agriculture and the use of mechanical tools, and implements of husbandry.
But the most important advantage to be gained by their trading within the United States, would
be in their protection from imposition. It has been truly and forcibly remarked,

"Humanity shudders at the recital of the nefarious acts practised by the white traders upon
the Indians. Yet not half of them are known or dreamed of by the American people. We refer
again, to Mr. Tanner's Narrative, which every man who has a vote on this subject ought to read.
Here we find the traders sometimes taking by force, from an Indian, the produce of a whole
year's hunt, without making him any return, sometimes pilfering a portion while buying the
remainder, and still oftener wresting from the poor wretches, while in a state of intoxication,
a valuable property, for an inadequate remuneration. In one place, our author tells of an Indian
woman, his adopted mother, who, "in the course of a single day, sold one hundred and twenty
beaver skins, with a large quantity of buffalo robes, dressed and smoked skins, and other articles,
for rum." He pathetically adds, "of all our large load of peltries, the produce of so many
days of toil, so many long and difficult journeys, one blanket and three kegs of rum, only
remained, besides the poor and almost worn out clothing on our bodies." The sending of missionaries,
to labor by the side of the miscreants who thus swindle and debauch the ignorant savage, is
a mockery of the office, and a waste of the time of these valuable men. If the Indians traded
within our states, with our regular traders, the same laws and the same public sentiment which
protects us, would protect them."

This is no exaggerated picture. Fraud, oppression and violence, have characterized our intercourse
with the Indians, and it is in vain to hope for any amelioration of their savage condition,
so long as an intercourse of this kind is permitted. In the very nature of things, the plan
of civilizing the Indians, by forming a confederacy of them, beyond the limits of the United
States, will prove unsuccessful, unless they are surrounded by a cordon of military posts,
and the whites are stayed, by physical force, from entering their territories for any purpose
whatever.

It is to this intercourse that the Indian wars, which have so frequently caused the blood of
the white and the red man to flow in torrents, upon our frontier, are mainly to be attributed.
It has been asserted, even by those who claim to be the grave historians of this unfortunate
people, that these wars are almost without exception, the result of that cruelty and insatiable
thirst for blood which belong to the Indian character. One of these writers, the Rev. Timothy
Flint, in his "Indian Wars of the West," says, "We affirm an undoubting belief, from no unfrequent,
nor inconsiderable means of observation, that aggression has commenced, in the account current
of mutual crime, as a hundred to one, on the part of the Indians." We do not question the sincerity
of this belief, but we do question, entirely, the correctness of the conclusion to which the
writer brings his mind: we affirm without hesitation, that it is a conclusion that cannot be
sustained by testimony. If the individual making it, had looked less superficially at the case,
and had gone to the primary causes that have produced the bloody collisions between his countrymen
and the Indians, he could never have made so great a mistake as the one he has committed in
the paragraph quoted above. If kindness, good faith and honesty of dealing, had marked our
social, political and commercial intercourse with the Indians, few, if any of these bloody
wars would have occurred; and these people, instead of being debased by our intercourse with
them, would have been improved and elevated in the scale of civilization. The history of the
early settlement of Pennsylvania and its illustrious founder, affords the strongest testimony
on this point. The justice, benevolence and kindness which marked the conduct of Penn towards
the Indians, shielded his infant colony from aggression, and won for him personally, a generous
affection, that would have been creditable to any race of people.

Upon this point it has been well and forcibly remarked by a philanthropic writer,[17] of our
country, that,

"The American Indian is sometimes regarded as a being who is prone to all that is revolting
and cruel. He is cherished in excited imaginations, as a demoniac phantasm, delighting in bloodshed,
without a spark of generous sentiment or native benevolence. The philosophy of man should teach
us, that the Indian is nothing less than a human being, in whom the animal tendencies predominate
over the spiritual. His morals and intellect having received neither culture nor developement,
he possesses on the one hand, the infirmities of humanity; while on the other the divine spark
in his heart, if not blown into a genial warmth, has not been extinguished by an artificial
polish. His affections are strong, because they are confined to a few objects; his enmities
are deep and permanent, because they are nursed in secret, without a religion to control them.
Friendship is with him a sacred sentiment. He undertakes long and toilsome journeys to do justice
to its object; he exposes himself, for its sake, to every species of privation; he fights for
it; and often dies in its defence. He appoints no fecial messenger to proclaim, by an empty
formality, the commencement of war. Whilst the European seeks advantages in the subtle finesse
of negociation, the American pursues them according to the instincts of a less refined nature,
and the dictates of a less sublimated policy. He seeks his enemy before he expects him, and
thus renders him his prey."

No better evidence need be adduced of his capacity for a lively and lasting friendship, than
the history of Pennsylvania, during the life time of the founder. It is refreshing and delightful
to see one fair page, in the dark volume of injustice and crime, which American annals, on
this subject present. While this page reflects upon the past an accumulated odium, it furnishes
lessons for the guide and edification of the future. Let me invite the philanthropist to this
affecting story.

A chief object of Penn, in the settlement of his province, was neither land, gold nor dominion,
but "the glory of God, by the civilization of the poor Indian." Upon his arrival in Pennsylvania,
the pledge contained in his charter was redeemed by a friendly compact with the "poor Indian"
which was never to be violated, and by a uniform and scrupulous devotion to his rights and
interests. Oldmixon and Clarkson inform us, that he expended "thousands of pounds" for the
physical and social improvement of these untutored and houseless tenants of the woods. His
estate became impaired by the munificence of his bounty. In return for benevolence so generous
and pure, the Indians showed a reality of affection and an ardor of gratitude, which they had
on no previous occasion professed. The colony was exempted from those calamities of war and
desolation, which form so prominent a picture in the early annals of American settlements.
During a period of forty years, the settlers and natives lived harmoniously together, neither
party complaining of a single act of violence or the infliction of an injury unredressed. The
memory of Penn lived green and fresh in their esteem, gratitude, and reverence, a century after.

The tribe thus subdued by the pacific and philanthropic principles of Penn, have been untruly
described as a cowardly and broken down race. They were a branch of the great family of Indians,
who, for so many years, carried on a fierce and bloody strife with the Alligewi on the Mississippi,
and waged a determined hostility with the Mengwe. At one period they were the undisputed masters
of the large tract of country, now known as the territory of the middle states. On the arrival
of the English, their number in Pennsylvania was computed at thirty or forty thousand souls.
Their history spoke only of conquest. They were a brave, proud and warlike race, who gloried
in the preservation of a character for valor, descended from the remotest times. The confederacy
of the Six Nations, by whom they were finally vanquished, was not formed until 1712, and their
defeat, as evidenced by their peculiar subjugation occurred within a few months antecedent
to the demise of the proprietary. The same people annihilated the colony of Des Vries, in 1632,
formed a conspiracy to exterminate the Swedes, under Printz, in 1646; and were the authors
of the subsequent murders which afflicted the settlements, before the accession of the English
colonists.

"Such an example furnishes some insight into the elements of Indian character. Little doubt
can exist, if the subject were fairly examined, that most of those sanguinary wars, of which
history speaks with a shudder, would be found to have arisen less from the blood-thirsty Indian,
than from the aggressions of the gold-thirsty and land-thirsty defamer."

INDIAN DANCING CEREMONIES.

In a historical memoir of the Indians, published in the North American Review and attributed
to the able pen of our present minister to France, there is a description of a war-dance, from
which the following extract is made.

"An Indian War Dance is an important occurrence in the passing events of a village. The whole
population is assembled, and a feast provided for all. The warriors are painted and prepared
as for battle. A post is firmly planted in the ground, and the singers, the drummers and other
musicians, are seated within the circle formed by the dancers and spectators. The music and
the dancers begin. The warriors exert themselves, with great energy. Every muscle is in action:
and there is the most perfect concord between the music and their movements. They brandish
their weapons, and with such apparent fury, that fatal accidents seem unavoidable. Presently
a warrior leaves the circle, and with his tomahawk or casse-tete, strikes the post. The music
and dancing cease, and profound silence ensues. He then recounts, with a loud voice, his military
achievements. He describes the battles he has fought--the prisoners he has captured--the scalps
he has taken. He points to his wounds, and produces his trophies. He accompanies his narrative
with the actual representation of his exploits; and the mimic engagement, the advance and the
retreat, are all exhibited to his nation as they really occurred. There is no exaggeration,
no misrepresentation. It would be infamous for a warrior to boast of deeds he never performed.
If the attempt were made, some one would approach and throw dirt in his face saying, "I do
this to cover your shame; for the first time you see an enemy, you will tremble." But such
an indignity is rarely necessary: and, as the war parties generally, contain many individuals,
the character and conduct of every warrior are well known. Shouts of applause accompany the
narration, proportioned in duration and intensity to the interest it excites. His station in
the circle is then resumed by the actor, and the dance proceeds, till it is interrupted in
a similar manner.

"In the poem of Ontwa, a scene like this is so well described, that we cannot resist the temptation
to transfer it to our pages. Of all who have attempted to embody in song, the "living manners"
of the Indians, the anonymous author of that poem has been the most successful. His characters,
and traditions and descriptions, have the spirit and bearing of life; and the whole work, is
not less true to nature than to poetry.

  A hundred warriors now advance,
  All dressed and painted for the dance;
  And sounding club and hollow skin
  A slow and measured time begin:
  With rigid limb and sliding foot,
  And murmurs low the time to suit;
  Forever varying with the sound,
  The circling band moves round and round.
  Now slowly rise the swelling notes
  When every crest more lively floats;
  Now tossed on high with gesture proud,
  Then lowly mid the circle bow'd;
  While clanging arms grow louder still,
  And every voice becomes more shrill;
  Till fierce and strong the clamor grows,
  And the wild war whoop bids it close.
  Then starts Skunktonga forth, whose band
  Came from far Huron's storm-beat strand,
  And thus recounts his battle feats,
  While his dark club the measure beats."

Major Long of the U.S. army, in his Expedition up the Missouri, gives an account of a council
which he held, at Council Bluff, with a party of one hundred Ottoes, seventy Missouries, and
fifty or sixty Soways. The Otto nation is known by the name of Wah-toh-ta-na. Their principal
village is situated on the river Platte, about forty miles above its junction with the Missouri.
At the period of this visit, these Indians had held little if any intercourse with the whites.
After the council was over, they performed a dance, in honor of their visitors, the description
of which will convey to the reader a very vivid picture of this ceremony. We give it, in Major
Long's own words. Several sets of dancers succeeded, each terminating as the first. In the
intervals of the dances, a warrior would step forward, and strike a flag-staff they had erected,
with a stick, whip, or other weapon, and recount his martial deeds. This ceremony is termed
striking the post, and whatever is then said, may be relied upon as rigid truth, being delivered
in the presence of many a jealous warrior and witness, who could easily detect, and would immediately
disgrace the striker for exaggeration or falsehood. This is called the beggar's dance--during
which, some presents are always expected by the performers; as tobacco, whiskey, or trinkets.
But on this occasion, as none of these articles were immediately offered, the amusement was
not, at first, distinguished by much activity.

"The master of the ceremonies continually called aloud to them to exert themselves, but still
they were somewhat dull and backward. Iëtan now stepped forward, and lashed a post with his
whip, declaring that he would punish those that did not dance. This threat, from one whom they
had vested with authority for this occasion, had a manifest effect upon his auditors, who were
presently highly wrought up, by the sight of two or three little mounds of tobacco twist, which
were now laid before them, and appeared to infuse new life.

"After lashing the post, and making his threat, Iëtan went on to narrate his martial exploits.
He had stolen horses seven or eight times from the Kanzas; he had first struck the bodies of
three of that nation slain in battle. He had stolen horses from the Iëtan nation, and had struck
one of their dead. He had stolen horses from the Pawnees, and struck the body of one Pawnee
Loup. He had stolen horses several times from the Omawhahs, and once from the Puncas. He had
struck the bodies of two Sioux. On a war party, in company with the Pawnees, he had attacked
the Spaniards, and penetrated into one of their camps; the Spaniards--excepting a man and a
boy--fled, himself being at a distance before his party; he was shot at and missed by the man,
whom he immediately shot down and struck. 'This, my father,' said he, 'is the only material
act of my life that I am ashamed of.'

"After several rounds of dancing, and of striking at the post, by the warriors, Mi-a-ke-ta,
or The Little Soldier, a war-worn veteran, took his turn to strike the post. He leaped actively
about, and strained his voice to its utmost pitch, whilst he portrayed some of the scenes of
blood in which he had acted. He had struck dead bodies of individuals of all the Red nations
around; Osages, Konzas, Pawnee Loups, Pawnee Republicans, Grand Pawnees, Puncas, Omawhaws,
Sioux, Padoucas, La Plain, or Bald heads, Iëtans, Sacs, Foxes, and Ioways. He had struck eight
of one nation, seven of another, &c.

"He was proceeding with his account, when Iëtan ran up to him, put his hand upon his mouth,
and respectfully led him to his seat. This act was no trifling compliment to the well-known
brave; it indicated, that he had so many glorious achievements to speak of, that he would occupy
so much time, as to prevent others from speaking; and, moreover, put to shame the other warriors,
by the contrast of his actions with theirs.

"Their physical action in dancing is principally confined to leaping a small distance from
the ground, with both feet, the body being slightly inclined, and, upon alighting, an additional
slight but sudden inclination of the body is made, so as to appear like a succession of jerks;
or the feet are raised alternately, the motion of the body being the same. Such are the movements
in which the whole party correspond; but, in the figures--as they are termed in our assembly
rooms--each individual performs a separate part, and each part is a significant pantomimic
narrative. In all their variety of action, they are careful to observe the musical cadences.
In this dance, Iëtan represented one who was in the act of stealing horses; he carried a whip
in his hand as did a considerable number of the Indians, and around his neck were thrown several
leathern thongs, for bridles and halters, the ends of which trailed upon the ground behind
him. After many preparatory manoeuvres, he stooped down, and with his knife, represented the
act of cutting the hopples of horses. He then rode his tomahawk, as children ride their broomsticks,
making use of his whip, as to indicate the necessity of rapid movement, lest his foes should
overtake him. Wa-sa-ha-jing-ga, or Little Black Bear, after a variety of gestures, threw several
arrows in succession, over his own head--thereby indicating his familiarity with the flight
of such missiles. He, at the same time, covered his eyes with his hand, to indicate that he
was blind to danger. Others represented their manoeuvres in battles, seeking their enemy, discharging
at him their guns or arrows, &c. &c.

"Most of the dancers were the principal warriors of the nation--men who had not condescended
to amuse themselves or others, in this manner, for years before. But they now appeared in honor
of the occasion, and to conciliate, in their best manner, the good will of the representative
of the government of the Big Knives. Amongst these veteran warriors, Iëtan, or Sha-mon-e-kus-see,
Ha-she-a (the Broken Arm), commonly called Cut Nose, and Wa-sa-ha-zing-ga (or Little Black
Bear), three youthful leaders, in particular, attracted our attention. In consequence of having
been appointed soldiers on this occasion, to preserve order, they were painted entirely black.
The countenance of the first indicated much wit, and had, in its expression, something of the
character of that of Voltaire. He frequently excited the mirth of those about him, by his remarks
and gestures. Ha-she-a, (called Cut Nose, in consequence of having lost the tip of his nose,
in a quarrel with Iëtan,) wore a handsome robe of white wolf skin, with an appendage behind
him, called a crow. This singular decoration is a large cushion, made of the skin of a crow,
stuffed with any light material, and variously ornamented. It has two decorated sticks, projecting
from it upward, and a pendent one beneath; this apparatus is secured upon the buttocks by a
girdle passing round the body. The other actors in the scene were decorated with paints of
several colors, fantastically disposed upon their persons. Several were painted with white
clay, which had the appearance of being grooved in many places. This grooved appearance is
given by drawing the finger-nails over the part, so as to remove the pigment from thence in
parallel lines. These lines are either rectilinear, undulated, or zigzag; sometimes passing
over the forehead transversely, or vertically; sometimes in the same direction, or obliquely
over the whole visage, or upon the breast, arms, &c. Many were painted with red clay, in which
the same lines appeared. A number of them had the representation of a black hand, with outspread
fingers, on different parts of the body, strongly contrasting with the principal color with
which the body was overspread; the hand was depicted in different positions upon the face,
breast, and back. The face of others was colored, one half black, and one half white, or red
and white, &c. Many colored their hair with red clay, but the eye-lids and base of the ears
were generally tinged with vermilion.

"At the conclusion of the ceremony, whiskey--which they always expect on similar occasions--was
produced, and a small portion was given to each. The principal Chiefs of the different nations
who had remained passive spectators of the scene, now directed their people to return to their
camp. The word of the Chiefs was obeyed, excepting by a few of the Ioways, who appeared to
be determined to keep their places, notwithstanding the reiterated command of the Chiefs. Iëtan
now sprang towards them, with an expression of much ferocity in his countenance, and it is
probable a tragic scene would have been displayed, had not the chiefs requested him to use
gentle means; and thus he succeeded; after which, the Chiefs withdrew."

CHAPTER II.

SALE OF WHISKEY TO THE INDIANS.

In tracing out the causes which led to the late war with the Sac and Fox Indians of Rock river,
reference was made to the violations of the laws of Congress in the introduction of whiskey
among them by the white traders. The opinion, moreover, was expressed that the licensed traders
of the United States, among these tribes, were in the habit of selling this article to them,
and under circumstances which must have brought home the fact to the knowledge of our Indian
agents. Black Hawk with other chiefs of the band to which he belonged, earnestly remonstrated
against the introduction of whiskey among his people, because of its debasing effect upon their
morals, and the danger of its provoking them to acts of aggression upon the whites, while in
a state of intoxication. One of the facts, set forth in the memorial which the white settlers
on Rock river, presented to Governor Reynolds, in 1831, and upon which he declared the state
to be actually invaded by the Sac and Fox Indians, and ordered out the militia to repel it,
was the destruction, by Black Hawk, of a barrel of whiskey, which the owner was retailing to
the Indians. The violation of the laws of Congress and of express treaty provisions, in the
sale of ardent spirits to the Indians, winked at, as they undoubtedly were, by the public agents,
mainly contributed to bring about a war, which resulted in the destruction of a great part
of the band of Black Hawk. That the allegations, in regard to the sale of intoxicating liquors,
to the Indians, by the regularly licensed traders of the United States, may not be supposed
to rest upon gratuitous assumptions, the following letter, is quoted, which places the matter
beyond all question.

                                     St. Peters, July 25, 1832

       GEN. JOSEPH M. STREET,        }
     Indian Agent, Prairie du Chien. }

     SIR--I arrived at this place yesterday from the sources of
     the Mississippi, having visited the Chippewa bands and
     trading-posts in that quarter. Much complaint is made respecting
     the conduct of the persons licensed by you last year, who located
     themselves at the Granite Rocks, and on the St. Croix. No doubt can
     exist that each of them took in, and used in their trade, a
     considerable quantity of whiskey. And I am now enabled to say, that
     they each located themselves at points within the limits of my
     agency, where there are no trading-posts established. My lowest
     trading-post on the Mississippi, is the Pierced Prairie, eighteen
     miles below the mouth of the De Corbeau. It embraces one mile
     square upon which traders are required to be located. On the St.
     Croix, the posts established and confirmed by the Department are
     Snake River and Yellow River, and embrace each, as the permanent
     place of location, one mile square. I report these facts for your
     information, and not to enable you to grant licenses for these
     posts, as the instructions of the Department give to each agent the
     exclusive control of the subject of granting licenses for the
     respective agencies.

     Much solicitude is felt by me to exclude ardent spirits wholly from
     the Chippewas and Ottowas, the latter of whom have, by a recent
     order, been placed under my charge. I am fully satisfied that
     ardent spirits are not necessary to the successful prosecution of
     the trade, that they are deeply pernicious to the Indians, and that
     both their use and abuse is derogatory to the character of a wise
     and sober government. Their exclusion in every shape, and every
     quantity, is an object of primary moment; and it is an object which
     I feel it a duty to persevere in the attainment of, however traders
     may bluster. I feel a reasonable confidence in stating, that no
     whiskey has been used in my agency during the last two years,
     except the limited quantity taken by special permission of the
     Secretary of War, for the trade of the Hudson's Bay lines; and
     saving also the quantity clandestinely introduced from Prairie du
     Chien and St. Peters.

     I know, sir, that an appeal to you on this subject cannot be lost,
     and that your feelings and judgment fully approve of temperance
     measures. But it requires active, persevering, unyielding efforts.
     And in all such efforts, judiciously urged, I am satisfied that the
     government will sustain the agents in a dignified discharge of
     their duties. Let us proceed in the accomplishment of this object
     with firmness, and with a determination never to relinquish it,
     until ardent spirits are entirely excluded from the Indian country.

                                          I am sir,
                                            Very respectfully,
                                              Your obedient servant,
                                                HENRY R. SCHOOLCRAFT.

     P.S. Capt. Jouett, commanding at this post, has recently seized
     sixteen kegs of high-wines. His prompt, decisive, and correct
     conduct in this, and other transactions relating to Indian affairs,
     merits the approbation of government.

     The Petite Corbeau has requested that no trader may be located at
     the mouth of the St. Croix.

The following picture of the present condition of the Winnebagoes, given in the St. Louis Bulletin,
shows the deplorable results of the intercourse of the whites with the Indians--the baneful
effects of spirituous liquors upon their morals and habits. The Winnebagoes were neighbors
of the Sacs and Foxes, and long intimately associated with them. Twenty years ago, all of these
tribes, raised annually more corn, beans and other vegetables, than were needed for their own
consumption. Now they are miserable, squalid beggars, without the means of subsistence. The
faithlessness of the Government, the perfidy and avarice of its agents and citizens, have brought
this race of people to the horrible condition, in which they are represented in the statement
that follows.

     An agent of the Temperance Society, in a journal of a late tour to
     the region of the Upper Mississippi, presents a picture, melancholy
     indeed, of the present condition of the Indian tribes in that
     quarter, which must deeply rouse the commiseration of every
     benevolent man. From our own personal observation one year since,
     we would corroborate the assertion, that were the world ransacked
     for a subject in which should be concentrated and personified
     injustice, oppression, drunkenness, squalid filth, and degradation,
     one would point to the straggling Indian on the banks of the Upper
     Mississippi for the aptest exemplification.

     There were some two or three hundred of these
     stragglers--Winnebagoes, chiefly, about Prairie du Chien--men,
     women, and children, many of whom had scarcely the fragments of a
     filthy blanket to hide their nakedness or screen them from the
     cold--strolling and straggling about in squads of from two to a
     half dozen each, begging for whiskey, or cold potatoes, or crusts
     of bread. One old female, doubtless turned of threescore and ten,
     half naked, was gathering up from the dirt and ashes about the
     boiler of the steam boat, a few pieces of dried apples that had
     been dropped and trodden under foot, which, with her toothless
     gums, she attempted to masticate with all the eagerness of a
     starving swine. Little children, from one to four years old, were
     crawling about in a state of nudity, and almost of starvation,
     while their own mothers and fathers, were staggering, and fighting,
     and swearing. It is a fact, that while these poor creatures
     cannot articulate a word of any thing else in English, the most
     awfully profane expressions will drop from their lips in English,
     as fluently as if it had been their vernacular tongue. When the
     whites first settled in that neighborhood, the Indians raised corn
     and other provisions enough, not only for their own use, but also
     for the fur-traders and settlers.

     Now they are altogether dependent for even the scanty subsistence
     by which they are dragging out the remnant of a miserable life,
     upon the whites. And what has been the cause of so great a change
     in a few years in the circumstances and habits of a whole people!
     The answer is plain to every one at all acquainted with Indian
     history. It is the perfidy and avarice of the whites, and
     WHISKEY, WHISKEY has been the all potent agent by which
     it has been effected. By selling and giving them whiskey till they
     become drunk, they are soon filched of the little annuities
     received from government; and then treated the rest of the year
     like so many dogs.--As an illustration of the feeling towards them,
     a merchant at Prairie du Chien expressed the very humane wish, that
     there might soon be another Indian war to kill them all off.

interesting matter about the aborigines of this country, and from which we have copied several
of the speeches made upon the liberation of Black Hawk.

[14] Black Hawk seems to have entertained a warm friendship for Colonel Davenport. On another
occasion, speaking of this council, he said, "I here met my old friend, a great war chief,
[Colonel William Davenport] whom I had known for eighteen years. He is a good and a brave chief.
He always treated me well, and gave me good advice. He made a speech to me on this occasion,
very different from that of the other chief. It sounded like coming from a brave." He adds,
"If our great father were to make such men our agents, he would much better subserve the interests
of our people, as well as his own, than in any other way; and had the war chief alluded to,
been our agent, we never should have had the difficulties with the whites which we have had."

Those who have the pleasure of a personal acquaintance with Colonel Davenport will join in
Black Hawk's spontaneous tribute to his character as a brave, and a gentleman of humane and
noble feelings.
