PREFACE

IN the daily life of the ordinary man, a life crowded with diverse interests and increasingly
complex demands, some few moments of a busy week or month or year are accorded to an interest
in art. Whatever may be his vocation, the man feels instinctively that in his total scheme
of life books, pictures, music have somewhere a place. In his own business or profession he
is an expert, a man of special training; and intelligently he does not aspire to a complete
understanding of a subject which lies beyond his province. In the same spirit in which he is
a master of his own craft, he is content to leave expert knowledge of art to the expert, to
the artist and to the connoisseur. For his part as a layman he remains frankly and happily
on the outside. But he feels none the less that art has an interest and a meaning even for
him. Though he does not practice any art himself, he knows that he enjoys fine things, a beautiful
room, noble buildings, books and plays, statues, pictures, music; and he believes that in his
own fashion he is able to appreciate art, I venture to think that he is right.

There is a case for the outsider in reference to art. And I have tried here to state it. This
book is an attempt to suggest the possible meaning of art to the ordinary man, to indicate
methods of approach to art, and to trace the way of appreciation. It is essentially a personal
record, an account of my own adventures with the problem. The book does not pretend to finality;
the results are true for me as far as I have gone. They may or may not be true for another.
If they become true for another man, he is the one for whom the book was written. I do not
apologize because the shelter here put together, in which I have found a certain comfort, is
not a palace. Rude as the structure may be, any man is welcomed to it who may find solace there
in an hour of need.

THE IMPULSE TO EXPRESSION

TOWARD evening a traveler through a wild country finds himself still in the open, with no hope
of reaching a village that night. The wind is growing chill; clouds are gathering in the west,
threatening rain. There rises in him a feeling of the need of shelter; and he looks about him
to see what material is ready to his hand. Scattered stones will serve for supports and low
walls; there are fallen branches for the roof; twigs and leaves can be woven into a thatch.
Already the general design has shaped itself in his mind. He sets to work, modifying the details
of his plan to suit the resources of his material. At last, after hours of hard thought and
eager toil, spurred on by his sense of his great need, the hut is ready; and fee takes refuge
in it as the storm breaks.

The entire significance of the man's work is shelter. The beginning of it lay in his need of
shelter. The impulse to action rose out of his consciousness of his need. His imagination conceived
the plan whereby the need might be met, and the plan gave shape to his material. The actual
result of his labor was a hut, but the hut itself was not the end for which he strove. The
hut was but the means. The all-inclusive import of his work--the stimulus which impelled him
to act, the purpose for which he toiled, and the end which he accomplished--is shelter.

A man of special sensitiveness to the appeal of color and form finds himself also in the open.
He is weary with the way, which shows but broken glimpses of the road. His spirit, heavy with
the "burden of the mystery," is torn by conflict and confusion. As he looks across the stony
places to the gnarled and weather-tortured trees beyond, and up to the clouds piling black
above him, there is revealed to him a sudden harmony among the discords; an inner principle,
apprehended by his imagination, compels the fragments of the seeming chaos into a regnant order.
These natural forms become for him the expression external to himself of the struggle of his
own spirit and its final resolution. The desire rises in him to express by his own act the
order he has newly perceived, the harmony of his spirit with the spirit of nature. As life
comes to him dominantly in terms of color and form, it is with color and form that he works
to expression so as to satisfy his need. The design is already projected in his imagination,
and to realize concretely his ideal he draws upon the material of nature about him. The picture
which he paints is not the purpose of his effort. The picture is but the means. His end is
to express the great new harmony in which his spirit finds shelter.

Both men, the traveler and the painter, are wayfarers. Both are seeking shelter from stress
and storm, and both construct their means. In one case the product is more obviously and immediately
practical, and the informing purpose tends to become obscured in the actual serviceableness
of the result. The hut answers a need that is primarily physical; the need in the other case
is spiritual. But it is a matter of degree. In essence and import the achievement of the two
men is the same. The originating impulse, a sense of need; the processes involved, the combination
of material elements to a definite end; the result attained, shelter which answers the need,--they
are identical. Both men are artists. Both hut and picture are works of art.

So art is not remote from common life after all. In its highest manifestations art is life
at its best; painting, sculpture, poetry, music are the distillment and refinement of experience.
Architecture and the subsidiary arts of decoration adorn necessity and add delight to use.
But whatever the flower and final fruit, art strikes its roots deep down into human need, and
draws its impulse and its sustenance from the very sources of life itself. In the wide range
from the hut in the wilderness to a Gothic cathedral, from the rude scratches recorded on the
cave walls of prehistoric man to the sublimities of the Sistine Chapel, there is no break in
the continuity of effort and aspiration. Potentially every man is an artist. Between the artist,
so-called, and the ordinary man there is no gulf fixed which cannot be passed. Such are the
terms of our mechanical civilization to-day that art has become specialized and the practice
of it is limited to a few; in consequence artists have become a kind of class. But essentially
the possibilities of art lie within the scope of any man, given the right conditions. So too
the separation of the "useful arts" from the "fine arts" is unjust to art and perversive of
right appreciation. Whatever the form in which it may manifest itself, from the lowest to the
highest, the art spirit is one, and it may quicken in any man who sets mind and heart to the
work of his hand. That man is an artist who fashions a new thing that he may express himself
in response to his need.

Art is creation. It is the combination of already existing material elements into new forms
which become thus the realization of a preconceived idea. Both hut and picture rose in the
imagination of their makers before they took shape as things. The material of each was given
already in nature; but the form, as the maker fashioned it, was new. Commonly we think of art
as the expression and communication of emotion. A picture, a statue, a symphony we recognize
as the symbol of what the artist has felt in some passage of his experience and the means by
which he conveys his feeling to us. Art is the expression of emotion, but all art springs out
of need. The sense of need which impels expression through the medium of creation is itself
an emotion. The hut which the traveler built for himself in the wilderness--shaping it according
to the design which his imagination suggested, having reference to his need and to the character
of his materials--was a work of creation; the need which prompted it presented itself to him
as emotion. The picture which the other wayfarer painted of the storm-swept landscape, a harmony
which his imagination compelled out of discords, was a work of creation; the emotion which
inspired the work was attended by need, the need of expression. The material and practical
utility of the hut obscures the emotional character of its origin; the emotional import of
the picture outweighs consideration of its utility to the painter as the means by which his
need of expression is satisfied. The satisfaction of physical needs which results in the creation
of utilities and the satisfaction of spiritual needs which results in the forms of expression
we commonly call works of art differ one from the other in their effect on the total man only
in degree. All works of use whose conception and making have required an act of creation are
art; all art--even in its supreme manifestations--embraces elements of use. The measure in
which a work is art is established by the intensity and scope of its maker's emotion and by
his power to body forth his feeling in harmonious forms which in turn recreate the emotion
in the spirit of those whom his work reaches.

In its essence and widest compass art is the making of a new thing in response to a sense of
need. The very need itself creates, working through man as its agent. This truth is illustrated
vividly by the miracles of modern invention. The hand of man unaided was not able to cope with
his expanding opportunities; the giant steam and the magician electricity came at his call
to work their wonders. The plow and scythe of the New England colonist on his little farm were
metamorphosed into the colossal steam-driven shapes, in which machinery seems transmuted into
intelligence, as he moved to the conquest of the acres of the West which summoned him to dominion.
First the need was felt; the contrivance was created in response. A man of business sees before
him in imagination the end to be reached, and applying his ideal to practical conditions, he
makes every detail converge to the result desired. All rebellious circumstances, all forces
that pull the other way, he bends to his compelling will, and by the shaping power of his genius
he accomplishes his aim. His business is his medium of self-expression; his success is the
realization of his ideal. A painter does no more than this, though he works with a different
material. The landscape which is realized ultimately upon his canvas is the landscape seen
in his imagination. He draws his colors and forms from nature around; but he selects his details,
adapting them to his end. All accidents and incidents are purged away. Out of the apparent
confusion of life rises the evident order of art. And in the completed work the artist's idea
stands forth salient and victorious.

That consciousness of need which compels creation is the origin of art. The owner of a dwelling
who first felt the need of securing his door so that he alone might possess the secret and
trick of access devised a lock and key, rude enough, as we can fancy. As the maker of the first
lock and key he was an artist. All those who followed where he had led, repeating his device
without modification, were but artisans. In the measure that any man changed the design, however,
adapting it more closely to his peculiar needs and so making it anew, to that extent he was
an artist also. The man who does a thing for the first time it is done is an artist; a man
who does a thing better is an artist. The painter who copies his object imitatively, finding
nothing, creating nothing, is an artisan, however skillful he may be. He is an artist in the
degree in which he brings to his subject something of his own, and fashioning it, however crudely,
to express the idea he has conceived of the object, so creates.

The difference between work which is art and work which is not art is just this element of
the originating impulse and creative act. The difference, though often seemingly slight and
not always immediately perceived, is all-important. It distinguishes the artist from the artisan;
a free spirit from a slave; a thinking, feeling man from a soulless machine. It makes the difference
between life rich and significant, and mere existence; between the mastery of fate and the
passive acceptance of things as they are.

If a mind and heart are behind it to control and guide it to expression, even the machine may
be an instrument in the making of a work of art. It is not the work itself, but the motive
which prompted the making of it, that determines its character as art. Art is not the way a
thing is done, but the reason why it is done. A chair, though turned on a lathe, may be a work
of art, if the maker has truly expressed himself in his work. A picture, though "hand-painted,"
may be wholly mechanical in spirit. To set about "making a picture" is to begin at the wrong
end. The impulse to art flows from within outwards. Art is bound up with life itself; like
nature, it is organic and must grow. The form cannot be laid on from the outside; it is born
and must develop in response to vital need. In so far as our acts are consciously the expression
of ourselves they are prompted by the art spirit.

All our acts are reducible to one of two kinds: either they are acts of creation, effecting
a new result, or they are acts of repetition. Acts of repetition tend rapidly to become habits;
and they may be performed without attention or positive volition. Thus, as I am dressing in
the morning I may be planning the work for the day; while my mind is given over to thought,
I lose the sense of my material surroundings, my muscles work automatically, the motor-currents
flowing through the well-worn grooves, and by force of habit the acts execute themselves. Obviously,
acts of repetition, or habits, make up the larger part of our daily lives.

Acts of creation, on the other hand, are performed by an effort of the will in response to
the consciousness of a need. To meet the new need we are obliged to make new combinations.
I assume that the traveler constructed his hut for the first time, shaping it to the special
new conditions; that the harmony which the painter discerned in the tumult around him he experienced
for the first time, and the picture which he paints, shaped with reference to his need and
fulfilling it, is a new thing. In the work produced by this act of creation, the feeling which
has prompted it finds expression. In the making of the hut, in the painting of the picture,
the impelling need is satisfied.

Although acts of repetition constitute the bulk of life, creation is of its very essence and
determines its quality. The significance and joy of life are less in being than in becoming.
Growth is expression, and in turn expression is made possible by growth. In our conscious experience
the sense of becoming is one of our supreme satisfactions. Growth is the purpose and the recompense
of our being here, the end for which we strive and the reward of all the effort and the struggle.
In the exercise of brain or hand, to feel the work take form, develop, and become something,--that
is happiness. And the joy is in the creating rather than in the thing created; the completed
work is behind us, and we move forward to new creation. A painter's best picture is the blank
canvas before him; an author's greatest book is the one he is just setting himself to write.
The desire for change for the sake of change which we all feel at times, a vague restlessness
of mind and body, is only the impulse to growth which has not found its direction. Outside
of us we love to see the manifestation of growth. We tend and cherish the little plant in the
window; we watch with delight the unfolding of each new leaf and the upward reach into blossom.
The spring, bursting triumphant from the silent, winter-stricken earth, is nature's parable
of expression, her symbol perennially renewed of the joy of growth.

The impulse to expression is cosmic and eternal. But even in the homeliness and familiarity
of our life from day to day the need of expression is there, whether we are entirely aware
of it or not; and we are seeking the realization and fulfillment of ourselves through the utterance
of what we are. A few find their expression in forms which with distinct limitation of the
term we call works of art. Most men find it in their daily occupations, their profession or
their business. The president of one of the great Western railroads remarked once in conversation
that he would rather build a thousand miles of railroad than live in the most sumptuous palace
on Fifth Avenue. Railroad building was his medium of expression; it was his art. Some express
themselves in shaping their material environment, in the decoration and ordering of their houses.
A young woman said, "My ambition is to keep my house well." Again, for her, housekeeping is
her art. Some find the realization of themselves in the friends they draw around them. Love
is but the utterance of what we essentially are; and the response to it in the loved one makes
the utterance articulate and complete. Expression rises out of our deepest need, and the need
impels expression.

The assertion that art is thus involved with need seems for the moment to run counter to the
usual conception, which regards art as a product of leisure, a luxury, and the result not of
labor but of play. Art in its higher forms becomes more and more purely the expression of emotion,
the un-trammeled record of the artist's spiritual experience. It is only when physical necessities
have been met or ignored that the spirit of man has free range. But the maker who adds decoration
to his bowl after he has moulded it is just as truly fulfilling a need--the need of self-expression--as
he fulfilled a need when he fashioned the bowl in the first instance in order that he might
slake his thirst. Art is not superadded to life,--something different in kind. All through
its ascent from its rudimentary forms to its highest, from hut to cathedral, art is coordinate
with the development of life, continuous and without breach or sudden end; it is the expression
step by step of ever fuller and ever deeper experience.

Creation, therefore, follows upon the consciousness of need, whether the need be physical,
as with the traveler, or spiritual, as with the painter; from physical to spiritual we pass
by a series of gradations. At their extremes they are easy to distinguish, one from the other;
but along the way there is no break in the continuity. The current formula for art, that art
is the utterance of man's joy in his work, is not quite accurate. In the act of creation the
maker finds the expression of himself. The man who decorates a bowl in response to his own
creative impulse is expressing himself. The painter who thrills to the wonder and significance
of nature is impelled to expression; and his delight is not fully realized and complete until
he has uttered it. Such art is love expressed, and the artist's work is his "hymn of the praise
of things." But the joy for both the potter and the painter, the joy which is so bound up with
art as to partake of its very essence, is the joy which attends self-expression and the satisfaction
of the need.

A work of art is a work of creation brought into being as the expression of emotion. The traveler
creates not the wood and stone but shelter, by means of the hut; the painter creates not the
landscape but the beauty of it; the musician creates not the musical tones, but by means of
a harmony of tones he creates an emotional experience. The impulse to art rises out of the
earliest springs of consciousness and vibrates through all life. Art does not disdain to manifest
itself in the little acts of expression of simple daily living; with all its splendid past
and vital present it is ever seeking new and greater forms whose end is not yet. I spoke of
the work of the traveler through the wilderness as art; the term was applied also to railroad-building
and to housekeeping. The truth to be illustrated by these examples is that the primary impulse
to artistic expression does not differ in essence from the impulse to creation of any kind.
The nature of the thing created, as art, depends upon the emotional value of the result, the
degree in which it expresses immediately the emotion of its creator, and the power it possesses
to rouse the emotion in others. To show that all art is creation and that all creation tends
toward art is not to obscure useful distinctions, but rather to restore art to its rightful
place in the life of man.

In the big sense, then, art is bounded only by life itself. It is not a cult; it is not an
activity practiced by the few and a mystery to be understood only by those who are initiated
into its secrets. One difficulty in the way of the popular understanding of art is due to the
fact that the term art is currently limited to its highest manifestations; we withhold the
title of artist from a good carpenter or cabinet-maker who takes a pride in his work and expresses
his creative desire by shaping his work to his own idea, and we bestow the name upon any juggler
in paint: with the result that many people who are not painters or musicians feel themselves
on that account excluded from all appreciation. If we go behind the various manifestations
of art to discover just what art is in itself and to determine wherein it is able to link itself
with common experience, we find that art is the response to a need. And that need may waken
in any man. Every man may be an artist in his degree; and every man in his degree can appreciate
art. A work of art is the expression of its maker's experience, the expression in such terms
that the experience can be communicated to another. The processes of execution involved in
fashioning a work, its technique, may be as incomprehensible and perplexed and difficult as
its executants choose to make them. Technique is not the same as art. The only mystery of art
is the mystery of all life itself. Accept life with its fundamental mysteries, with its wonders
and glories, and we have the clue to art. But we miss the central fact of the whole matter
if we do not perceive that art is only a means. It is by expression that we grow and so fulfill
ourselves. The work itself which art calls into being is not the end. It fails of its purpose,
remaining void and vain, if it does not perform its function. The hut which does not furnish
shelter is labor lost. The significance of the painter's effort does not stop with the canvas
and pigment which he manipulates into form and meaning. The artist sees beyond the actual material
thing which he is fashioning; his purpose in creation is expression. By means of his picture
he expresses himself and so finds the satisfaction of his deepest need. The beginning and the
end of art is life.

But the artist's work of expression is not ultimately complete until the message is received,
and expression becomes communication as his utterance calls out a response in the spirit of
a fellow-man. Art exists not only for the artist's sake but for the appreciator too. As art
has its origin in emotion and is the expression of it, so for the appreciator the individual
work has a meaning and is art in so far as it becomes for him the expression of what he has
himself felt but could not phrase; and it is art too in the measure in which it is the revelation
of larger possibilities of feeling and creates in him a new emotional experience. The impulse
to expression is common to all; the difference is one of degree. And the message of art is
for all, according as they are attuned to the response. Art is creation. For the artist it
is creation by expression; for the appreciator it is creation by evocation. These two principles
complete the cycle; abstractly and very briefly they are the whole story of art.

To be responsive to the needs of life and its emotional appeal is the first condition of artistic
creation. By new combinations of material elements to bring emotion to expression in concrete
harmonious forms, themselves charged with emotion and communicating it, is to fashion a work
of art. To feel in material, whether in the forms of nature or in works of art, a meaning for
the spirit is the condition of appreciation.

II

THE ATTITUDE OF RESPONSE

IT is a gray afternoon in late November. The day is gone; evening is not yet come. Though too
dark to read or write longer, it is not dark enough for drawn shades and the lamp. As I sit
in the gathering dusk, my will hovering between work done and work to do, I surrender to the
mood of the moment. The day is accomplished, but it is not yet a remembrance, for it is still
too near for me to define the details that made up its hours. Consciousness, not sharp enough
for thought, floats away into diffused and obscure emotion. The sense is upon me and around
me that I am vaguely, unreasoningly, yet pleasantly, unhappy. Out of the dimness a trick of
memory recalls to me the lines,--

     "Tears! tears! tears!
     In the night, in solitude, tears,
     On the white shore dripping, dripping, suck'd in by the sand,
     Tears, not a star shining, all dark and desolate,
     Moist tears from the eyes of a muffled head;
     O who is that ghost? that form in the dark, with tears?
     What shapeless lump is that, bent, crouch'd there on the sand?
     Streaming tears, sobbing tears, throes, choked with wild cries;
     O storm, embodied, rising, careering with swift steps along the
          beach!
     O wild and dismal night storm, with wind--O belching and
          desperate!
     O shade so sedate and decorous by day, with calm countenance
          and regulated pace,
     But away at night as you fly, none looking--O then the
          unloosened ocean
     Of tears! tears! tears!"

Now I know. My mood was the mood of tears. The poet, too, has felt what I was feeling. And
as a poet he has been able to bring his emotion to expression. By the magic of phrase and the
mystery of image he has, out of the moving of his spirit, fashioned a concrete reality. By
means of his expression, because of it, his emotion becomes realized, and so reaches its fulfillment.
And for me, what before was vague has been made definite. The poet's lines have wakened in
me a response; I have felt what he has phrased; and now they become my expression too. As my
mood takes form, I become conscious of its meaning. I can distill its significance for the
spirit, and in the emotion made definite and realizable as consciousness I feel and know that
I am living. Doubly, completely, the poem is a work of art. And my response to it, the absorption
of it into my own experience, is appreciation.

I appreciate the poem as I make the experience which the poet has here phrased my own, and
at the instant of reading I live out in myself what he has lived and here expressed. I read
the words, and intellectually I take in their signification, but the poem is not realized in
me until it wakens in me the feeling which the words are framed to convey. The images which
an artist employs have the power to rouse emotion in us, so that they come to stand for the
emotion itself. We care for nature and it is beautiful to us as its forms become objectively
the intimate expression for us of what we feel.

     "O to realize space!
     The plenteousness of all, that there are no bounds,
     To emerge and be of the sky, of the sun and moon and flying
          clouds, as one with them."

In his contact with the external world the artist identifies himself with his object. If he
is painting a tree he in a measure becomes the tree; he values it at all because it expresses
for him concretely what he feels in its presence. The object and his spirit fuse; and through
the fusion they together grow into a new and larger unity. What his work expresses is not the
object for its own sake but this larger unity of his identity with it. To appreciate the artist's
work, therefore, we must in our turn merge ourselves in his emotion, and becoming one with
it, so extend our personality into larger life.

To make the artist's emotion our own, to identify ourselves with the object which he presents
to us, we must pass beyond the material form in which the work is embodied, letting the spirit
and meaning of it speak to our spirit. In itself an individual picture or statue or symphony
is an objective, material thing, received into consciousness along the channel of the senses;
but its origin and its end alike are in emotion. The material form, whether in nature or in
works of art, is only the means by which the emotion is communicated. A landscape in nature
is composed of meadow and hills, blue sky and tumbling clouds; these are the facts of the landscape.
But they are not fixed and inert. The imagination of the beholder combines these elements into
a harmony of color and mass; his spirit flows into consonance with the harmony his imagination
has compelled out of nature, becoming one with it. To regard the world not as facts and things,
but as everywhere the stimulus of feeling, feeling which becomes our own experience, is the
condition of appreciation.

To the awakening mind of a child, life is full of wonder, and each unfolding day reveals new
marvels of excitement and surprise. As yet untrammeled by any sense of the limitations of material,
his quick imagination peoples his world with creatures of his fancy, which to him are more
real than the things he is able actually to see and touch. For him the external world is fluid
and plastic, to be moulded into forms at will in obedience to his creative desire. In the tiny
bundle of rags which mother-love clasps tight to her heart, a little girl sees only the loveliest
of babies; and a small boy with his stick of lath and newspaper cap and plume is a mightier
than Napoleon. The cruder the toy, the greater is the pleasure in the game; for the imagination
delights in the exercise of itself. A wax doll, sent from Paris, with flaxen hair and eyes
that open and shut, is laid away, when the mere novelty of it is exhausted, in theatric chest,
and the little girl is fondling again her first baby of rag and string. A real steel sword
and tin helmet are soon cast aside, and the boy is back again among the toys of his own making.
That impulse to creation which all men feel, the impulse which makes the artist, is especially
active in a child; his games are his art. With a child material is not an end but a means.
Things are for him but the skeleton of life, to be clothed upon by the flesh and blood reality
of his own fashioning. His feeling is in excess of his knowledge. He has a faculty of perception
other than the intellectual. It is imagination.

The child is the first artist. Out of the material around him he creates a world of his own.
The prototypes of the forms which he devises exist in life, but it is the thing which he himself
makes that interests him, not its original in nature. His play is his expression. He creates;
and he is able to merge himself in the thing created. In his play he loses all consciousness
of self. He and the toy become one, caught up in the larger unity of the game. According as
he identifies himself with the thing outside of him, the child is the first appreciator.

Then comes a change.

Imagination surrenders to the intellect; emotion gives place to knowledge.

Gradually the material world shuts in about us until it becomes for us a hard, inert thing,
and no longer a living, changing presence, instinct with infinite possibilities of experience
and feeling. Now custom lies upon us

          "with a weight,
     Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!"

It happens, unfortunately for our enjoyment of life, that we get used to things. Little by
little we come to accept them, to take them for granted, and they cease to mean anything to
us. Habit, which is our most helpful ally in lending our daily life its practical efficiency,
is the foe of emotion and appreciation. Habit allows us to perform without conscious effort
the innumerable little acts of each day's necessity which we could not possibly accomplish
if every single act required a fresh exercise of will. But just because its action is unconscious
and unregarded, habit blunts the edge of our sensibilities. "Thus let but a Rising of the Sun,"
says Carlyle, "let but a creation of the World happen twice, and it ceases to be marvelous,
to be noteworthy, or noticeable."

"Except ye become as little children!" Unless the world is new-created every day, unless we
can thrill to the beauty of nature with its fair surfaces and harmonies of vibrant sounds,
or quicken to the throb of human life with its occupations and its play of energies, its burdens
and its joys, unless we find an answer to our needs, and gladness, in sunlight or storms, in
the sunset and evening and solitude under the stars, in fields and hills or in thronging city
streets, in conflict and struggle or in the face of a friend, unless each new day is a gift
and new opportunity, then we cannot interpret the meaning of life nor read the riddle of art.
For we cannot truly appreciate art except as we learn to appreciate life. Until then art has
no message for us; it is a sealed book, and we shall not open the book nor loose the seals
thereof. The meaning of life is for the spirit, and art is its minister. To share in the communion
we must become as children. As a child uses the common things of life to his own ends, transfiguring
them by force of his creative desire, and fashioning thus a wonderful world of his own by the
exercise of his shaping imagination, a world of limitless incident and high adventure, so we
must penetrate the visible and tangible actuality around us, the envelope of seemingly inert
matter cast in forms of rigid definition, and we must open ourselves to the influence of nature.
That influence--nature's power to inspire, quicken, and dilate--flowing through the channel
of the senses, plays upon our spirit. The indwelling significance of things is apprehended
by the imagination, and is won for us in the measure that we feel.

As we respond to the emotional appeal of the great universe external to ourselves we come to
realize that the material world which we see and touch is not final.

The "life of things" is their significance for the spirit. By spirit I mean the sum of our
conscious being, that complete entity within us which we recognize as the self. The material
world, external, visible, tangible, may be regarded as the actual world. The real world is
the world of spiritual forces and relations, apprehended by the imagination and received with
feeling. Life, in the sense of our conscious experience of the world, is the moving of the
spirit in emotion.

The measure of life for the individual, therefore, is the degree of intensity with which he
feels. Experience is not meted out by weeks and months; it is to be sounded by the depth and
poignancy of instant emotion. Variety and multitude of incident may crowd through insentient
years and leave no record of their progress along the waste places of their march. Or a day
may be a lifetime. In such moments of intensest experience time and space fall away and are
not. The outermost bounds of things recede; they vanish altogether: and we are made free of
the universe. At such moments we are truly living; then we really are.

As the meaning of art is not the material thing which it calls into form, but what the work
expresses of life, so in order to appreciate art it is necessary to appreciate life, which
is the inspiration of art and its fulfillment. To appreciate life is to send out our being
into experience and to feel,--to realize in terms of emotion our identity with the great universe
outside of us, this world of color and form and sound and movement, this web of illimitable
activities and energies, shot through with currents of endlessly varied and modulated feeling.
"My son," says the father in Hindu lore, pointing to an animal, a tree, a rock, "my son, thou
art that!" The universe is one. Of it we are each an essential part, distinct as individuals,
yet fusing with it in our sense of our vital kinship with all other parts and with the whole.
I am sauntering through the Public Garden on a fragrant hushed evening in June; touched by
the lingering afterglow, the twilight has not yet deepened into night. Grouped about a bench,
children are moving softly in the last flicker of play, while the mother nods above them. On
the next bench a wanderer is stretched at full length, his face hidden in his crooked-up arm.
I note a couple seated, silent, with shoulder touching shoulder. I meet a young man and woman
walking hand in hand; they do not see me as I pass. Beyond, other figures are soundless shadows,
gathering out of the enveloping dusk. It is all so intimate and friendly. The air, the flowers,
the bit of water through the trees reflecting the lights of the little bridge, are a caress.
And it is all for me! I am a child at his tired play, I am the sleeping tramp, I am the young
fellow with his girl. It is not the sentiment of the thing, received intellectually, that makes
it mine. My being goes out into these other lives and becomes one with them. I feel them in
myself. It is not thought that constitutes appreciation; it is emotion.

Another glimpse, caught this time through a car window. Now it is a winter twilight. The flurry
of snow has passed. The earth is penetrated with blue light, suffused by it, merged in it,
ever blue. Vague forms, still and shadowy, of hills and trees, soppy with light, are blue within
the blue. The brief expanse of bay is deeply luminous and within the pervasive tempering light
resolves itself into the cool and solemn reaches of the sky which bends down and touches it.
Once more my spirit meets and mingles with the spirit of the landscape. By the harmony of nature's
forms and twilight tones I am brought into a larger harmony within myself and with the world
around.

All experience offers to us at any moment just such possibilities of living. The infinite and
ever-changing expressiveness of nature at every instant of day and night is ours to read if
we will but look upon it with the inner vision. The works of men in cities and cultivated fields,
if we will see beyond the actual material, may quicken our emotions until we enact in ourselves
their story of struggle, of hopes and ambitions partly realized, of defeat or final triumph.
The faces seen in a passing crowd bear each the record of life lived, of lives like ours of
joys or disappointments, lives of great aims or no aims at all, of unwritten heroisms, of hidden
tragedies bravely borne, lives sordid and mean or generous and bright. The panorama of the
world unrolls itself for us. It is ours to experience and live out in our own being according
as we are able to feel. Just as the impulse to expression is common to all men, and all are
artists potentially, differing in the depth of their insight into life and in the degree of
emotion they have to express, so appreciation lies within the scope of all, and the measure
of it to us as individuals is determined by our individual capability of response.

Life means to each one of us what we are able to receive of it in "wise passiveness," and then
are able by the constructive force of our individuality to shape into coherence and completeness.
As the landscape which an artist paints is the landscape visioned in imagination, though composed
of forms given in nature, so life furnishes us the elements of experience, and out of these
elements we construct a meaning, each for himself. To one man an object or incident is commonplace
and blank; to another it may be charged with significance and big with possibilities of fuller
living. "In every object." says Carlyle, "there is inexhaustible meaning; the eye sees in it
what it brings means of seeing." To see is not merely to receive an image upon the retina.
The stimulation of the visual organ becomes sight properly only as the record is conveyed to
the consciousness. When I am reading a description of a sunset, there is an image upon my retina
of a white page and black marks of different forms grouped in various combinations. But what
I see is the sunset. Momentarily to rest the eye upon a landscape is not really to see it,
for our mind may be quite otherwhere. We see the landscape only as it becomes part of our conscious
experience. The beauty of it is in us. A novelist conceives certain characters and assembles
them in action and reaction, but it is we who in effect create the story as we read. We take
up a novel, perhaps, which we read five years ago; we find in it now new significances and
appeals. The book is the same; it is we who have changed. We bring to it the added power of
feeling of those five years of living. Art works not by information but by evocation. Appreciation
is not reception but response. The artist must compel us to feel what he has felt,--not something
else. But the scope of his message, with its overtones and subtler implications, is limited
by the rate of vibration to which we are attuned.

And again Whitman says, "A great poem is no finish to a man or woman, but rather a beginning."
The final significance of both life and art is not won by the exercise of the intellect, but
unfolds itself to us in the measure that we feel.

To illustrate the nature of appreciation and the power from which appreciation derives, the
power to project ourselves into the world external to us, I spoke of the joy of living peculiar
to the child and to the childlike in heart. But that is not quite the whole of the story. A
child by force of his imagination and capacity of feeling is able to pass beyond the limits
of material, and he lives in a world of exhaustless play and happiness; for him objects are
but means and not an end. To transcend thus the bounds of matter imposed by the senses and
to live by the power of emotion is the first condition of appreciation. The second condition
of appreciation is to feel and know it, to become conscious of ourselves in our relation to
the object. To live is the purpose of life; to be aware that we are living is its fulfillment
and the reward of appreciation.

Experience has a double value. There is the instant of experience itself, and then the reaction
on it. A child is unconscious in his play; he is able to forget himself in it completely. At
that moment he is most happy. The instant of supreme joy is the instant of ecstasy, when we
lose all consciousness of ourselves as separate and distinct individualities. We are one with
the whole. But experience does not yield us its fullest and permanent significance until, having
abandoned ourselves to the moment, we then react upon it and become aware of what the moment
means. A group of children are at play. Without thought of themselves they are projected into
their sport; with their whole being merged in it, they are intensely living. A passer on the
street stands and watches them. For the moment, in spirit he becomes a child with them. In
himself he feels the absorption and vivid reality to them of what they are doing. But he feels
also what they do not feel, and that is, what it means to be a child. Where they are unconscious
he is conscious; and therefore he is able, as they are not, to distill the significance of
their play. This recognition makes possible the extension of his own life; for the man adds
to himself the child. The reproach is sometimes brought against Walt Whitman that the very
people he writes about do not read him. The explanation is simple and illustrates the difference
between the unconscious and the conscious reception of life. The "average man" who is the hero
of Whitman's chants is not aware of himself as such. He goes about his business, content to
do his work; and that makes up his experience. It is not the average man himself, but the poet
standing outside and looking on with imaginative sympathy, who feels what it means to be an
average man. It is the poet who must "teach the average man the glory of his daily walk and
trade." It is not enough to be happy as children are happy,--unconsciously. We must be happy
and know it too.

The attitude of appreciation is the attitude of response,--the projection of ourselves into
new and fuller ranges of feeling, with the resultant extension of our personality and a larger
grasp on life. We do not need to go far afield for experience; it is here and now. To-day is
the only day, and every day is the best day. "The readiness is all." But mere contact with
the surface of life is not enough. Living does not consist in barely meeting the necessities
of our material existence; to live is to feel vibrantly throughout our being the inner significance
of things, their appeal and welcome to the spirit. This fair world of color and form and texture
is but a show world, after all,--this world which looms so near that we can see it, touch it,
which comes to us out of the abysms of time and recedes into infinitudes of space whither the
imagination cannot follow it. The true and vital meaning of it resides within and discovers
itself to us finally as emotion. Some of this meaning art reveals to us, and in that measure
it helps us to find ourselves. But art is only the means. The starting-point of the appreciation
of art, and its goal, is the appreciation of life. The reward of living is the added ability
to live. And life yields its fullest opportunities, its deepest tragedies, its highest joys,
all its infinite scope of feeling, to those who enter by the gate of appreciation.

III

TECHNIQUE AND THE LAYMAN

A PEASANT is striding across a field in the twilight shadow of a hill. Beyond, where the fold
of the hill dips down into the field, another peasant is driving a team of oxen at a plow.
The distant figures are aglow with golden mellow light, the last light of day, which deepens
the gloom of the shadowing hillside. The sower's cap is pulled tight about his head, hiding
under its shade the unseeing eyes. The mouth is brutal and grim. The heavy jaw flows down into
the thick, resistive neck. The right arm swings powerfully out, scattering the grain. The left
is pressed to his body; the big, stubborn hand clutches close the pouch of seed. Action heroic,
elemental; the dumb bearing of the universal burden. In the flex of the shoulder, the crook
of the outstretched arm, the conquering onward stride, is expressed all the force of that word
of the Lord to the first toiler, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread."

Three men are standing before Millet's canvas.

One recognizes the subject of the picture. With the pleasure of recognition he notes what the
artist has here represented, and he is interested in the situation. This is a peasant, and
he is sowing his grain. So the onlooker stands and watches the peasant in his movement, and
he thinks about the sower, recalling any sower he may have read of or seen or known, his own
sower rather than the one that Millet has seen and would show to him. This man's pleasure in
the picture has its place.

The second of the three men is attracted by the qualities of execution which the work displays,
and he is delighted by what he calls the "actual beauty" of the painting. With eyes close to
the canvas he notes the way Millet has handled his materials, his drawing, his color, his surfaces
and edges, all the knack of the brush-work, recognizing in his examination of the workmanship
of the picture that though Millet was a very great artist, he was not a great painter, that
the reach of his ideas was not equaled by his technical skill. Then as the beholder stands
back from the canvas to take in the ensemble, his eye is pleased by the color-harmony, it rests
lovingly upon the balance of the composition, and follows with satisfaction the rhythmic flow
of line. His enjoyment is both intellectual and sensuous. And that too has its place.

The third spectator, with no thought of the facts around which the picture is built, not observing
the technical execution as such, unconscious at the moment also of its merely sensuous charm,
feels within himself, "I am that peasant!" In his own spirit is enacted the agelong world-drama
of toil. He sees beyond the bare subject of the picture; the medium with all its power of sensuous
appeal and satisfaction becomes transparent. The beholder enters into the very being of the
laborer; and as he identifies himself with this other life outside of him, becoming one with
it in spirit and feeling, he adds just so much to his own experience. In his reception of the
meaning of Millet's painting of the "Sower" he lives more deeply and abundantly.

It is the last of these three men who stands in the attitude of full and true appreciation.
The first of the three uses the picture simply as a point of departure; his thought travels
away from the canvas, and he builds up the entire experience out of his own knowledge and store
of associations. The second man comes a little nearer to appreciation, but even he falls short
of full realization, for he stops at the actual material work itself. His interest in the technical
execution and his pleasure in the sensuous qualities of the medium do not carry him through
the canvas and into the emotion which it was the artist's purpose to convey. Only he truly
appreciates the painting of the "Sower" who feels something of what Millet felt, partaking
of the artist's experience as expressed by means of the picture, and making it vitally his own.

But before the appreciator can have brought himself to the point of perception where he is
able to respond directly to the significance of art and to make the artist's emotion a part
of his own emotional experience, he must needs have traveled a long and rather devious way.
Appreciation is not limited to the exercise of the intellect, as in the recognition of the
subject of a work of art and in the interest which the technically minded spectator takes in
the artist's skill. It does not end with the gratification of the senses, as with the delight
in harmonious color and rhythmic line and ordered mass. Yet the intellect and the senses, though
they are finally but the channel through which the artist's meaning flows to reach and rouse
the feelings, nevertheless play their part in appreciation. Between the spirit of the artist
and the spirit of the appreciator stands the individual work of art as the means of expression
and communication. In the work itself emotion is embodied in material form. The material which
art employs for expression constitutes its language. Certain principles govern the composition
of the work, certain processes are involved in the making of it, and the result possesses certain
qualities and powers. The processes which enter into the actual fashioning of the work are
both intellectual and physical, requiring the exercise of the artist's mind in the planning
of the work and in the directing of his hand; so far as the appreciator concerns himself with
them, they address themselves to his intellect. The finished work in its material aspect possesses
qualities which are perceived by the senses and which have a power of sensuous delight. Upon
these processes and these qualities depends in part the total character of a work of art, and
they must be reckoned with in appreciation.

In his approach to any work of art, therefore, the layman is confronted first of all with the
problem of the language which the work employs. Architecture uses as its language the structural
capabilities of its material, as wood or stone, bringing all together into coherent and serviceable
form. Poetry is phrased in words. Painting employs as its medium color and line and mass. At
the outset, in the case of any art, we have some knowledge of the signification of its terms.
Here is a painting of a sower. Out of previous experience of the world we easily recognize
the subject of the picture. But whence comes the majesty of this rude peasant, the dignity
august of this rough and toil-burdened laborer, his power to move us? In addition to the common
signification of its terms, then, language seems to have a further expressiveness, a new meaning
imparted to it by the way in which the artist uses it. In a poem we know the meaning of the
words, but the poetry of it, which we feel rather than know, is the creation of the poet, wrought
out of the familiar words by his cunning manipulation of them.

A drama in twelve lines. These are words of common daily usage, every one,--for the most part
aggressively so. But the romance which they effuse, the glamour which envelops the commonplace
incident as with an aura, is due to the poet's strategic selection of his terms, the one right
word out of many words that offered, and his subtle combination of his terms into melody and
rhythm. The wonder of the poet's craft is like the musician's,--

     "That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a
          star."

A building rises before us; we recognize it as a building, and again easily we infer the purpose
which it serves, that it is a temple or a dwelling. And then the beauty of it, a power to affect
us beyond the mere feet that it is a building, lays hold upon us, an influence emanating from
it which we do not altogether explain to ourselves. Simply in its presence we feel that we
are pleased. The fact, the material which the artist uses, exists out there in nature. But
the beauty of the building, the majesty and power of the picture, the charm of the poem,--this
is the art of the artist; and he wins his effects by the way in which he handles his materials,
by his technique. Some knowledge of technique, therefore,--not the artist's knowledge of it,
but the ability to read the language of art as the artist intends it to be read,--is necessary
to appreciation.

The hut which the traveler through a wild country put together to provide himself shelter against
storm and the night was in essence a work of art. The purpose of his effort was not the hut
itself but shelter, to accomplish which he used the hut as his means. The emotion of which
the work was the expression, in this case the traveler's consciousness of his need, embodied
itself in a concrete form and made use of material. The hut which he conceived in response
to his need became for him the subject or motive of his work. For the actual expression of
his design he took advantage of the qualities of his material, its capabilities to combine
thus and so; these inherent qualities were his medium. The material wood and stone which he
employed were the vehicle of his design. The way in which he handled his vehicle toward the
construction of the hut, availing himself of the qualities and capabilities of his material,
might be called his technique.

The sight of some landscape wakens in the beholder a vivid and definite emotion; he is moved
by it to some form of expression. If he is a painter he will express his emotion by means of
a picture, which involves in the making of it certain elements and certain processes. The picture
will present selected facts in the landscape; the landscape, then, as constructed according
to the design the painter has conceived of it, becomes the motive or subject of his picture.
The particular aspects of the landscape which the picture records are its color and its form.
These qualities of color and form are the painter's medium. An etching of the scene would use
not color but line to express the artist's emotion in its presence; so line is the medium of
etching. But "qualities" of objects are an abstraction unless they are embodied in material.
In order, therefore, to give his medium actual embodiment the painter uses pigment, as oil-color
or water-color or tempera, laid upon a surface, as canvas, wood, paper, plaster; this material
pigment is his vehicle. The etcher employs inked scratches upon his plate of zinc or copper,
bitten by acid or scratched directly by the needle; these marks of ink are the vehicle of etching.
To the way in which the artist uses his medium for practical expression and to his methods
in the actual handling of his vehicle is applied the term technique. The general conception
of his picture, its total design, the choice of motive, the selection of details, the main
scheme of composition,--these belong to the great strategy of his art. The application of these
principles in practice and their material working out upon his canvas are an affair of tactics
and fall within the province of technique.

The ultimate significance of a work of art is its content of emotion, the essential controlling
idea, which inspires the work and gives it concrete form. In its actual embodiment, the expressive
power of the work resides in the medium. The medium of any art, then, as color and mass in
painting, line in drawing and etching, form in sculpture, sound in music, is its means of expression
and constitutes its language. Now the signification of language derives from convention. Line,
for example, which may be so sensitive and so expressive, is only an abstraction and does not
exist in nature. What the draughtsman renders as line is objectively in fact the boundary of
forms. A head, with all its subtleties of color and light and shade, may be represented by
a pencil or charcoal drawing, black upon a white surface. It is not the head which is black
and white, but the drawing. Our acceptance of the drawing as an adequate representation of
the head rests upon convention. Writing is an elementary kind of drawing; the letters of the
alphabet were originally pictures or symbols. So to-day written or printed letters are arbitrary
symbols of sounds, and grouped together in arbitrary combinations they form words, which are
symbols of ideas. The word sum stood to the old Romans for the idea "I am;" to English-speaking
people the word signifies a "total" and also a problem in arithmetic. A painting of a landscape
does not attempt to imitate the scene; it uses colors and forms as symbols which serve for
expression. The meaning attaching to these symbols derives from common acceptance and usage,
Japanese painting, rendering the abstract spirit of movement of a wave, for example, rather
than the concrete details of its surface appearance, differs fundamentally from the painting
of the western world; it is none the less pregnant with meaning for those who know the convention.
To understand language, therefore, we must understand the convention and accept its terms.
The value of language as a means of expression and communication depends upon the knowledge,
common to the user and to the person addressed, of the signification of its terms. Its effectiveness
is determined by the way in which it is employed, involving the choice of terms, as the true
line for the false or meaningless one, the right value or note of color out of many that would
almost do, the exact and specific word rather than the vague and feeble; involving also the
combination of terms into articulate forms. These ways and methods in the use of language are
the concern of technique. Technique, therefore, plays an important part in the creation and
the ultimate fortunes of the artist's work.

Just here arises a problem for the layman in his approach to art. The man who says, "I don't
know anything about art, but I know what I like," is a familiar figure in our midst; of such,
for the most part, the "public" of art is constituted. What he really means is, "I don't know
anything about technique, but art interests me. I read books, I go to concerts and the theatre,
I look at pictures; and in a way they have something for me." If we make this distinction between
art and technique, the matter becomes simplified. The layman does not himself paint pictures
or write books or compose music; his contact with art is with the purpose of appreciation.
Life holds some meaning for him, as he is engaged in living, and there his chief interest lies.
So art too has a message addressed to him, for art starts with life and in the end comes back
to it. If art is not the expression of vital feeling, in its turn communicating the feeling
to the appreciator so that he makes it a real part of his experience of life, then the thing
called art is only an exercise in dexterity for the maker and a pastime for the receiver; it
is not art. But art is not quite the same as life at first hand; it is rather the distillment
of it. In order to render the significance of life as he has perceived and felt it, the artist
selects and modifies his facts; and his work depends for its expressiveness upon the material
form in which the emotion is embodied. The handling of material to the end of making it expressive
is an affair of technique. The layman may ask himself, then, To what extent is a knowledge
of technique necessary for appreciation? And how may he win that knowledge?

On his road to appreciation the layman is beset with difficulties. Most of the talk about art
which he hears is either the translation of picture or sonata into terms of literary sentiment
or it is a discussion of the way the thing is done. He knows at least that painting is not
the same as literature and that music has its own province; he recognizes that the meaning
of pictures is not literary but pictorial, the meaning of music is musical. But the emphasis
laid upon the manner of execution confuses and disturbs him. At the outset he frankly admits
that he has no knowledge of technical processes as such. Yet each art must be read in its own
language, and each has its special technical problems. He realizes that to master the technique
of any single art is a career. And yet there are many arts, all of which may have some message
for him in their own kind. If he must be able to paint in order to enjoy pictures rightly,
if he cannot listen intelligently at a concert without being able himself to compose or at
least to perform, his case for the appreciation of art seems hopeless.

If the layman turns to his artist friends for enlightenment and a little sympathy, it is possible
he may encounter a rebuff. Artists sometimes speak contemptuously of the public. "A painter,"
they say, "paints for painters, not for the people; outsiders know nothing about painting."
True, outsiders know nothing about painting, but perhaps they know a little about life. If
art is more than intellectual subtlety and manual skill, if art is the expression of something
the artist has felt and lived, then the outsider has after all some standard for his estimate
of art and a basis for his enjoyment. He is able to determine the value of the work to himself
according as it expresses what he already knows about life or reveals to him fuller possibilities
of experience which he can make his own. He does not pretend to judge painting; but he feels
that he has some right to appreciate art. In reducing all art to a matter of technique artists
themselves are not quite consistent. My friends Jones, a painter, and Smith, a composer, do
not withhold their opinion of this or that novel and poem and play, and they discourse easily
on the performances of Mr. James and Mr. Swinburne and Mr. Shaw; but I have no right to talk
about the meaning to me of Jones's picture or Smith's sonata, for my business is with words,
and therefore I cannot have any concern with painting or with music. To be sure, literature
uses as its vehicle the means of communication of daily life, namely, words. But the art in
literature, the interpretation of life which it gives us, as distinct from mere entertainment,
is no more generally appreciated than the art in painting. A man's technical accomplishment
may be best understood and valued by his fellow-workmen in the same craft; and often the estimate
set by artists on their own work is referred to the qualities of its technical execution. As
a classic instance, Raphael sent some of his drawings to Albert Dürer to "show him his hand."
So a painter paints for the painters. But the artist gives back a new fullness and meaning
to life and addresses all who live. That man is fortunate who does not allow his progress toward
appreciation to be impeded by this confusion of technique with art.

The emphasis which workers in any art place upon their powers of execution is for themselves
a false valuation of technique, and it tends to obscure the layman's vision of essentials.
Technique is not, as it would seem, the whole of art, but only a necessary part. A work of
art in its creation involves two elements,--the idea and the execution. The idea is the emotional
content of the work; the execution is the practical expressing of the idea by means of the
medium and the vehicle. The idea of Millet's "Sower" is the emotion attending his conception
of the laborer rendered in visual terms; the execution of the picture is exhibited in the composition,
the color, the drawing, and the actual brush-work. So, too, the artist himself is constituted
by two qualifications, which must exist together: first, the power of the subject over the
artist; and second, the artist's power over his subject. The first of these without the second
results simply in emotion which does not come to expression as art. The second without the
first produces sham art; the semblance of art may be fashioned by technical skill, but the
life which inspires art is wanting. The artist, then, may be regarded in a dual aspect. He
is first a temperament and a mind, capable of feeling intensely and able to integrate his emotions
into unified coherent form; in this aspect he is essentially the artist. Secondly, for the
expression of his idea he brings to bear on the execution of his work his command of the medium,
his intellectual adroitness and his manual skill; in this aspect he is the technician. Every
artist has a special kind of means with which he works, requiring knowledge and dexterity;
but it may be assumed that in addition to his ability to express himself he has something to
say. We may test a man's merit as a painter by his ability to paint. As an artist his greatness
is to be judged with reference to the greatness of his ideas; and in his capacity as artist
his technical skill derives its value from the measure in which it is adequate to their expression.
In the case of an accomplished pianist or violinist we take his proficiency of technique for
granted, and we ask, What, with all this power of expression at his command, has he to say?
In his rendering of the composer's work what has he of his own to contribute by way of interpretation?
Conceding at once to Mr. Sargent his supreme competence as a painter, his consummate mastery
of all his means, we ask, What has he seen in this man or this woman before him worthy of the
exercise of such skill? In terms of the personality he is interpreting, what has he to tell
us of the beauty and scope of life and to communicate to us of larger emotional experience?
The worth of technique is determined, not by its excellence as such, but by its efficiency
for expression.

It is difficult for an outsider to understand why painters, writers, sculptors, and the rest,
who are called artists in distinction from the ordinary workman, should make so much of their
skill. Any man who works freely and with joy takes pride in his performance. And instinctively
we have a great respect for a good workman. Skill is not confined to those who are engaged
in what is conventionally regarded as art. Indeed, the distinction implied in favor of "art"
is unjust to the wide range of activities of familiar daily life into which the true art spirit
may enter. A bootblack who polishes his shoes as well as he can, not merely because he is to
be paid for it, though too he has a right to his pay, but because that is his work, his means
of expression, even he works in the spirit of an artist. Extraordinary skill is often developed
by those who are quite outside the pale of art. In a circus or music-hall entertainment we
may see a man throw himself from a trapeze swinging high in air, and after executing a double
somersault varied by complex lateral gyrations, catch the extended arms of his partner, who
is hanging by his knees on another flying bar. Or a man leaning backwards over a chair shoots
at a distance of fifty paces a lump of sugar from between the foreheads of two devoted assistants.
Such skill presupposes intelligence. Of the years of training and practice, of the sacrifice
and the power of will, that have gone to the accomplishment of this result, the looker-on can
form but little conception. These men are not considered artists. Yet a painter who uses his
picture to exhibit a skill no more wonderful than theirs would be grieved to be accounted an
acrobat or a juggler. Only such skill as is employed in the service of expression is to be
reckoned with as an element in art; and in art it is of value not for its own sake but as it
serves its purpose. The true artist subordinates his technique to expression, justly making
it a means and not the end. He cares for the significance of his idea more than for his sleight
of hand; he effaces his skill for his art.

A recognition of the skill exhibited in the fashioning of a work of art, however, if seen in
its right relation to the total scope of the work, is a legitimate source of pleasure. Knowledge
of any subject brings its satisfactions. To understand with discerning insight the workings
of any process, whether it be the operation of natural laws, as in astronomy or chemistry,
whether it be the construction of a locomotive, the playing of a game of foot-ball, or the
painting of a picture, to see the "wheels go round" and know the how and the wherefore,--undeniably
this is a source of pleasure. In the understanding of technical processes, too, there is a
further occasion of enjoyment, differing somewhat from the satisfaction which follows in the
train of knowledge.

     "There is a pleasure in poetic pains
     Which only poets know,"

says the poet Cowper. There is a pleasure in the sense of difficulties overcome known only
to those who have tried to overcome them. But such enjoyment--the pleasure which comes with
enlightened recognition and the pleasure of mastery and triumph--derives from an intellectual
exercise and is not to be confounded with the full appreciation of art. Art, finally, is not
the "how" but the "what" in terms of its emotional significance. Our pleasure in the result,
in the design itself, is not the same as our pleasure in the skill that produced the work.
The design, with the message that it carries, not the making of it, is the end of art.

Too great preoccupation with technique conflicts with full appreciation. To fix the attention
upon the manner of expression is to lose the meaning. A style which attracts notice to itself
is in so far forth bad style, because it defeats its own end, which is expression; but beyond
this, our interest in technical execution is purely intellectual, whereas art reaches the emotions.
At the theatre a critic sits unmoved; dispassionately he looks upon the personages of the drama,
as they advance, retreat, and countermarch, little by little yielding up their secret, disclosing
all the subtle interplay of human motives. From the heights of his knowledge the critic surveys
the spectacle; with an insight born of his learning, he penetrates the mysteries of the playwright's
craft. He knows what thought and skill have gone into this result; he knows the weary hours
of toil, the difficulties of invention and selection, the heroic rejections, the intricacies
of construction, the final triumph. He sees it all from the point of view of the master-workman,
and sympathetically he applauds his success; his recognition of what has been accomplished
is his pleasure. But all the while he has remained on the outside. Not for a moment has he
become a party to the play. He brings to it nothing of his own feeling and power of response.
There has been no union of his spirit with the artist's spirit,--that union in which a work
of art achieves its consummation. The man at his side, with no knowledge or thought of how
the effect has been won, surrenders himself to the illusion. These people on the stage are
more intensely and vividly real to him than in life itself; the artist has distilled the significance
of the situation and communicates it to him as emotion. The man's reaction is not limited to
the exercise of his intellect,--he gives himself. In the experience which the dramatist conveys
to him beautifully, shaping discords into harmony and disclosing their meaning for the spirit,
he lives.

A true artist employs his medium as an instrument of expression; and he values his own technical
skill in the handling of it according to the measure that he is enabled thereby to express
himself more effectively. On the layman's part so much knowledge of technique is necessary
as makes it possible for him to understand the artist's language and the added expressiveness
wrought out of language by the artist's cunning use of it. And such knowledge is not beyond
his reach.

In order to understand the meaning of any language we must first understand the signification
of its terms, and then we must know something of the ways in which they may be combined into
articulate forms of expression. The terms of speech are words; in order to speak coherently
and articulately we must group words into sentences according to the laws of the tongue to
which they belong. Similarly, every art has its terms, or "parts of speech," and its grammar,
or the ways in which the terms are combined. The terms of painting are color and form, the
terms of music are tones. Colors and forms are brought together into harmony and balance that
by their juxtaposition they may be made expressive and beautiful. Tones are woven into a pattern
according to principles of harmony, melody, and rhythm, and they become music. When technique
is turned to such uses, not for the vainglory of a virtuoso, but for the service of the artist
in his earnest work of expression, then it identifies itself with art.

A knowledge of the signification of the terms of art the layman may win for himself by a recognition
of the expressive power of all material and by sensitiveness to it. The beholder will not respond
to the appeal of a painting of a landscape unless he has himself felt something of the charm
or glory of landscape in nature; he will not quicken and expand to the dignity or force caught
in rigid marble triumphantly made fluent in statue or relief until he has realized for himself
the significance of form and movement which exhales from every natural object. Gesture is a
universal language. The mighty burden of meaning in Millet's picture of the "Sower" is carried
by the gesture of the laborer as he swings across the background of field and hill, whose forms
also are expressive; here, too, the elemental dignity of form and movement is reinforced by
the solemnity of the color. Gesture is but one of nature's characters wherewith she inscribes
upon the vivid, shifting surface of the world her message to the spirit of man. A clue to the
understanding of the terms of art, therefore, is found in the layman's own appreciation of
the emotional value of all objects of sense and their multitudinous power of utterance,--the
sensitive decision of line, the might or delicacy of form, the splendor and subtlety of color,
the magic of sound, the satisfying virtue of harmony in whatever embodiment, all the beauty
of nature, all the significance of human life. And this appreciation is to be won largely by
the very experience of it. The more we feel, the greater becomes our power for deeper feeling.
Every emotion to which we thrill is the entrance into larger capacity of emotion. We may allow
for growth and trust to the inevitable working of its laws. In the appreciation of both life
and art the individual may be his own teacher by experience.

The qualities of objects with their inherent emotional values constitute the raw material of
art, to be woven by the artist into a fabric of expressive form and texture. Equipped with
a knowledge of the terms of any art, the layman has yet to understand something of the ways
in which the terms may be combined. Every artist has his idiom or characteristic style. Rembrandt
on the flat surface of his canvas secures the illusion of form in the round by a system of
light and shade; modeling is indicated by painting the parts in greater relief in light and
the parts in less relief in shadow. Manet renders the relief of form by a system of "values,"
or planes of more and less light. The local color of objects is affected by the amount of light
they receive and the distance an object or part of an object is from the eye of the spectator.
Manet paints with degrees of light, and he wins his effects, not by contrasts of color, but
by subtle modulations within a given hue. Landscape painters before the middle of the nineteenth
century, working with color in masses, secured a total harmony by bringing all their colors,
mixed upon the palette, into the same key. The "Luminarists," like Claude Monet, work with
little spots or points of color laid separately upon the canvas; the fusion of these separate
points into the dominant tone is made by the eye of the beholder. The characteristic effect
of a work of art is determined by the way in which the means are employed. Some knowledge,
therefore, of the artist's aims as indicated in his method of working is necessary to a full
understanding of what he wants to say.

In his effort to understand for his own purposes of appreciation what the artist has accomplished
by his technique, the layman may first of all distinguish between processes and results. A
landscape in nature is beautiful to the beholder because he perceives in it some harmony of
color and form which through the eye appeals to the emotions. His vision does not transmit
every fact in the landscape; instinctively his eye in its sweep over meadow and trees and hill
selects those details that compose. By this act of integration he is for himself in so far
forth an artist. If he were a painter he would know what elements in the landscape to put upon
his canvas. But he has no skill in the actual practice of drawing and of handling the brush,
no knowledge of mixing colors and matching tones; he understands nothing of perspective and
"values" and the relations of light and shade. He knows only what he sees, that the landscape
as he sees it is beautiful; and equally he recognizes as beautiful the presentment of it upon
canvas. He is ignorant of the technical problems with which the painter in practice has had
to contend in order to reach this result; it is the result only that is of concern to him in
so far as it is or is not what he desires. The painter's color is significant to him, not because
he knows how to mix the color for himself, but because that color in nature has spoken to him
unutterable things and he has responded to it. The layman cannot make a sunset and he cannot
paint a picture; but he can enjoy both. So he cares, then, rather for what the painter has
done than for how he has done it, because the processes do not enter into his own experience.
The picture has a meaning for him in the measure that it expresses what he perceives and feels,
and that is the beauty of the landscape.

Any knowledge of technical processes which the layman may happen to possess may be a source
of intellectual pleasure. But for appreciation, only so much understanding of technique is
necessary as enables him to receive the message of a given work in the degree of expressiveness
which the artist by his use of his medium has attained. A clue to this understanding may come
to him by intuition, by virtue of his own native insight and intelligence. He may gain it by
reading or by instruction. He may go out and win it by intrepid questioning of those who know;
and it is to be hoped that such will be very patient with him, for after all even a layman
has the right to live. Once started on the path, then, in the mysteries of art as in the whole
complex infinite business of living, he becomes his own tutor by observation and experience;
and he may develop into a fuller knowledge in obedience to the law of growth. Each partial
clue to understanding brings him a step farther on his road; each new glimmer of insight beckons
him to ultimate illumination. Though baffled at the outset, yet patient under disappointment,
undauntedly he pushes on in spite of obstacles, until he wins his way at last to true appreciation.

If the layman seeks a standard by which to test the value of any technical method, he finds
it in the success of the work itself. Every method is to be judged in and for itself on its
own merits, and not as better or worse than some other method. Individually we may prefer Velasquez
to Frans Hals; Whistler may minister to our personal satisfaction in larger measure than Mr.
Sargent; we may enjoy Mr. James better than Stevenson; Richard Strauss may stir us more deeply
than Brahms. We do not affirm thereby that impressionism is inherently better than realism,
or that subtlety is more to be desired than strength; the psychological novel is not necessarily
greater than romance; because of our preference "programme music" is not therefore more significant
than "absolute music." The greatness of an artist is established by the greatness of his ideas,
adequately expressed. And the value of any technical method is determined by its own effectiveness
for expression.

There is, then, no invariable standard external to the work itself by which to judge technique.
For no art is final. A single work is the manifestation of beauty as the individual artist
has conceived or felt it. The perception of what is beautiful varies from age to age and with
each person. So, too, standards of beauty in art change with each generation; commonly they
are deduced from the practice of preceding artists. Classicism formulates rules from works
that have come to be recognized as beautiful, and it requires of the artist conformity to these
rules. By this standard, which it regards as absolute, it tries a new work, and it pretends
to adjudge the work good or bad according as it meets the requirements. Then a Titan emerges
who defies the canons, wrecks the old order, and in his own way, to the despair or scorn of
his contemporaries, creates a work which the generation that follows comes to see is beautiful.
"Every author," says Wordsworth, "as far as he is great and at the same time original, has
had the task of creating the taste by which he is to be enjoyed." Wordsworth in his own generation
was ridiculed; Millet, when he ceased painting nudes for art-dealers' windows and ventured
to express himself, faced starvation. Every artist is in some measure an innovator; for his
own age he is a romanticist. But the romanticist of one age becomes a classic for the next;
and his performance in its turn gives laws to his successors. Richard Strauss, deriving in
some sense from Wagner, makes the older man seem a classic and conservative. Then a new mind
again is raised up, a new temperament, with new needs; and these shape their own adequate new
expression. "The cleanest expression," says Whitman, "is that which finds no sphere worthy
of itself and makes one." As all life is growth, as there are no bounds to the possibilities
of human experience, so the workings of the art-impulse cannot be compressed within the terms
of a hard and narrow definition, and any abstract formula for beauty is in the very nature
of things foredoomed to failure. No limit can be set to the forms in which beauty may be made
manifest.

"The true poets are not followers of beauty, but the august masters of beauty." And Whitman's
own verse is a notable example of a new technique forged in response to a new need of expression.
Dealing as he did with the big basic impulses of common experience accessible to all men, Whitman
needed a largeness and freedom of expression which he did not find in the accepted and current
poetic forms. To match the limitlessly diversified character of the people, occupations, and
aspirations of "these States," as yet undeveloped but vital and inclosing the seed of unguessed-at
possibilities, to tally the fluid, indeterminate, outward-reaching spirit of democracy and
a new world, the poet required a medium of corresponding scope and flexibility, all-inclusive
and capable of endless modulation and variety. Finding none ready to his hand, he created it.
Not that Whitman did not draw for his resources on the great treasury of world-literature;
and he profited by the efforts and achievement of predecessors. But the form in his hands and
as he uses it is new. Whatever we may think of the success of his total accomplishment, there
are very many passages to which we cannot deny the name of poetry. Nor did Whitman work without
conscious skill and deliberate regard for technical processes. His note-books and papers reveal
the extreme calculation and pains with which he wrote, beginning with the collection of synonyms
applying to his idea and mood, and so building them up gradually, with many erasures, corrections,
and substitutions, into the finished poem. Much of the vigor of his style is due to his escape
from conventional literary phrase-making and his return to the racy idiom of common life. His
verse, apparently inchoate and so different from classical poetic forms, is shaped with a cunning
incredible skill. And more than that, it is art, in that it is not a bare statement of fact,
but communicates to us the poet's emotion, so that we realize the emotion in ourselves. When
his purpose is considered, it is seen that no other technique was possible. His achievement
proves that a new need creates its own means of expression.

What is true of Whitman in respect to his technique is true in greater or less degree of every
artist, working in any form. It is true of Pheidias, of Giotto and Michelangelo and Rembrandt,
of Dante and Shakespeare, of Beethoven and Wagner, of Monet, of Rodin, in fine, from the beginnings
of art to the day that now is. All have created out of existing forms of expression their own
idiom and way of working. Every artist owes something to his predecessors, but language is
re-created in the hands of each master and becomes a new instrument. There can be then no single
formula for technical method nor any fixed and final standard of judgment.

An artist himself is justified from his own point of view in his concern with technique, for
upon his technique depends his effectiveness of expression. His practice serves to keep alive
the language and to develop its resources. Art in its concrete manifestations is an evolution.
From Velasquez through Goya to Manet and Whistler is a line of inheritance. But a true artist
recognizes that technique is only a means. As an artist he is seeking to body forth in external
form the vision within, and he tries to make his medium "faithful to the coloring of his own
spirit." Every artist works out his characteristic manner; but the progress must be from within
outwards. Toward the shaping of his own style he is helped by the practice of others, but he
is helped and not hindered only in so far as the manner of others can be made genuinely the
expression of his own feeling. Direct borrowing of a trick of execution and servile imitation
of a style have no place in true art. A painter who would learn of Velasquez should study the
master's technique, not that in the end he may paint like Velasquez, but that he may discover
just what it was that the master, by means of his individual style, was endeavoring to express,
and so bring to bear on his own environment here in America to-day the same ability to see
and the same power of sympathetic and imaginative penetration that Velasquez brought to his
environment at the court of seventeenth-century Spain. The way to paint like Velasquez is to
be Velasquez. No man is a genius by imitation. Every man may seek to be a master in his own
right. Technique does not lead; it follows. Style is the man.

From within outwards. Art is the expression of sincere and vital feeling; the material thing,
picture, statue, poem, which the artist conjures into being is only a means. The moment art
is worshiped for its own sake, that moment decadence begins. "No one," says Leonardo, "will
ever be a great painter who takes as his guide the paintings of other men." In general the
history of art exhibits this course. In the beginning arises a man of deep and genuine feeling,
the language at whose command, however, has not been developed to the point where it is able
to carry the full burden of his meaning. In the generations which supervene, artists with less
fervor of spirit but with growing skill of hand, increased with each inheritance, turn their
efforts to the development of their means. The names of this period of experiment and research
are Masaccio, Uccello, Pollaiuolo, Verrocchio. At length, when the fullness of time is come,
emerges the master-mind, of original insight and creative power. Heir to the technical achievements
of his predecessors, he is able to give his transcendent idea its supremely adequate expression.
Content is perfectly matched by form. On this summit stand Michelangelo, Raphael, Leonardo.
Then follow the Carracci, Domenichino, Guercino, Guido Reni, Carlo Dolci, men who mistake the
master's manner for his meaning. The idea, the vital principle, has spent itself. The form
only is left, and that is elaborated into the exuberance of decay. Painters find their impulse
no longer in nature and life but in paint. Technique is made an end in itself. And art is dead,
to be reborn in another shape and guise.

The relation of technique to appreciation in the experience of the layman begins now to define
itself. Technique serves the artist for efficient expression; an understanding of it is of
value to the layman in so far as the knowledge helps him to read the artist's language and
thus to receive his message. Both for artist and for layman technique is only a means. Out
of his own intelligent and patient experience the layman can win his way to an understanding
of methods; and his standard of judgment, good enough for his own purposes, is the degree of
expressiveness which the work of art, by virtue of its qualities of execution, is able to achieve.
Skill may be enjoyed intellectually for its own sake as skill; in itself it is not art. Technique
is most successful when it is least perceived. Ars celare artem: art reveals life and conceals
technique. We must understand something of technique and then forget it in appreciation. When
we thrill to the splendor and glory of a sunset we are not thinking of the laws of refraction.
Appreciation is not knowledge, but emotion.

IV

THE VALUE OF THE MEDIUM

AS I swing through the wide country in the freshness and fullness of a blossoming, sun-steeped
morning in May, breathing the breath of the fields and the taller by inches for the sweep of
the hills and the reaches of sky above my head, every nerve in my body is alive with sensation
and delight. My joy is in the fragrance of earth, the ingratiating warmth of the fresh morning,
the spacious, inclosing air. My pleasure in this direct contact with the landscape is a physical
reaction, to be enjoyed only by the actual experience of it; it cannot be reproduced by any
other means; it can be recalled by memory but faintly and as the echo of sensation. There is,
however, something else in the landscape which can be reproduced; and this recall may seem
more glorious than the original in nature. There are elements in the scene which a painter
can render for me more intensely and vividly than I perceived them for myself. These elements
embody the value that the landscape has for my emotions. The scene appeals to something within
me which lies beyond my actual physical contact with it and the mere sense of touch. The harmony
that the eye perceives in these open fields, the gracious line of trees along the stream's
edge, the tossing hills beyond, and the arch of the blue sky above impregnating the earth with
light, is communicated to my spirit, and I feel that this reach of radiant country is an extension
of my own personality. A painter, by the manipulation of his color and line and mass, concentrates
and intensifies the harmony of it and so heightens its emotional value. The meaning of the
scene for the spirit is conveyed in terms of color and mass.

Color and mass are the painter's medium, his language. The final import of art is the idea,
the emotional content of the work. On his way to the expression of his idea the artist avails
himself of material to give his feeling concrete actuality and visible or audible realization.
He paints a picture, glorious in color and compelling in the concentration of its massing;
he carves a statue, noble in form or subtly rhythmic; he weaves a pattern of harmonious sounds.
He values objects not for their own sake but for the energies they possess,--their power to
rouse his whole being into heightened activity. And they have this power by virtue of their
material qualities, as color and form or sound. A landscape is gay in springtime or sad in
autumn. The difference in its effect upon us is not due to our knowledge that it is spring
or autumn and our consciousness of the associations appropriate to each season. The emotional
quality of the scene is largely a matter of its color. Let the spring landscape be shrouded
in gray mist sifting down out of gray skies, and we are sad. Let the autumn fields and woodland
sparkle and dance in the crisp golden sunlight, and our blood dances with them and we want
to shout from full lungs. In music the major key wakens a different emotion from the minor.
The note of a violin is virgin in quality; the voice of the 'cello is the voice of experience.
The distinctive emotional value of each instrument inheres in the character of its sound. These
qualities of objects art uses as its language.

Though all art is one in essence, yet each art employs a medium of its own. In order to understand
a work in its scope and true significance we must recognize that an artist thinks and feels
in terms of his special medium. His impulse to create comes with his vision, actual or imaginative,
of color or form, and his thought is transmitted to his hand, which shapes the work, without
the intervention of words. The nature of his vehicle and the conditions in which he works determine
in large measure the details of the form which his idea ultimately assumes. Thus a potter designs
his vessel first with reference to its use and then with regard to his material, its character
and possibilities. As he models his plastic clay upon a wheel, he naturally makes his bowl
or jug round rather than sharply angular. A pattern for a carpet, to be woven by a system of
little squares into the fabric, will have regard for the conditions in which it is to be rendered,
and it will differ in the character of its lines and masses from a pattern for a wall-paper,
which may be printed from blocks. The designer in stained glass will try less to make a picture
in the spirit of graphic representation than to produce an harmonious color-pattern whose outlines
will be guided and controlled by the possibilities of the "leading" of the window. The true
artist uses the conditions and very limitations of his material as his opportunity. The restraint
imposed by the sonnet form is welcomed by the poet as compelling a collectedness of thought
and an intensity of expression which his idea might not achieve if allowed to flow in freer
channels. The worker in iron has his triumphs; the goldsmith has his. The limitations of each
craft open to it effects which are denied to the other. There is an art of confectionery and
an art of sculpture. The designer of frostings who has a right feeling for his art will not
emulate the sculptor and strive to model in the grand style; the sculptor who tries to reproduce
imitatively the textures of lace or other fabrics and who exuberates in filigrees and fussinesses
so far departs from his art as to rival the confectioner. In the degree that a painter tries
to wrench his medium from its right use and function and attempts to make his picture tell
a story, which can better be told in words, to that extent he is unfaithful to his art. Painting,
working as it does with color and form, should confine itself to the expression of emotion
and idea that can be rendered visible. On the part of the appreciator, likewise, the emotion
expressed in one kind of medium is not to be translated into any other terms without a difference.
Every kind of material has its special value for expression. The meaning of pictures, accordingly,
is limited precisely to the expressive power of color and form. The impression which a picture
makes upon the beholder maybe phrased by him in words, which are his own means of expression;
but he suggests the import of the picture only incompletely. If I describe in words Millet's
painting of the "Sower" according to my understanding of it, I am telling in my own terms what
the picture means to me. What it meant to Millet, the full and true significance of the situation
as the painter felt it, is there expressed upon his canvas in terms of visible aspect; and
correspondingly, Millet's meaning is fully and truly received in the measure that we feel in
ourselves the emotion roused by the sight of his color and form.

The essential content of a work of art, therefore, is modified in its effect upon us by the
kind of medium in which it is presented. If an idea phrased originally in one medium is translated
into the terms of another, we have illustration. Turning the pages of an "illustrated" novel,
we come upon a plate showing a man and a woman against the background of a divan, a chair,
and a tea-table. The man, in a frock coat, holding a top hat in his left hand, extends his
right hand to the woman, who has just risen from the table. The legend under the picture reads,
"Taking his hat, he said good-by." Here the illustrator has simply supplied a visible image
of what was suggested in the text; the drawing has no interest beyond helping the reader to
that image. It is a statement of the bare fact in other terms. In the hands of an artist, however,
the translation may take on a value of its own, changing the original idea, adding to it, and
becoming in itself an independent work of art. This value derives from the form into which
the idea is translated. The frescoes of the Sistine Chapel are only sublime illustration; but
how little of their power attaches to the subject they illustrate, and how much of their sublimity
lies in the painter's rendering! Conversely, an example of the literary interpretation of a
picture is Walter Pater's description of Leonardo's Mona Lisa.

It is Leonardo's conception, yet with a difference. Here the critic has woven about the subject
an exquisite tissue of associations, a whole wide background of knowledge and thought and feeling
which it lay beyond the painter's range to evoke; but the critic is denied the vividness, the
immediateness and intimate warmth of vital contact, which the painter was able to achieve.
The Lisa whom Leonardo shows us and the Lisa whom Pater interprets for us are the same in essence
yet different in their power to affect us. The difference resulting from the kind of medium
employed is well exemplified by Rossetti's "Blessed Damozel." The fundamental concept of both
poem and picture is identical, but picture and poem have each its distinctive range and limitations
and its own peculiar appeal. If we cancel the common element in the two, the difference remaining
makes it possible for us to realize how much of the effect of a work of art inheres in the
medium itself. Painting may be an aid to literature in that it helps us to more vivid images;
the literary interpretation of pictures or music gives to the works with which it deals an
intellectual definiteness. But the functions peculiar to each art are not to be confounded
nor the distinctions obscured.

Pictures are not a substitute for literature, and their true meaning is finally not to be translated
into words. Their beauty is a visible beauty; the emotions they rouse are such as can be conveyed
through the sense of sight. In the end they carry their message sufficingly as color and mass.
Midway, however, our enjoyment may be complicated by other elements which have their place
in our total appreciation. Thus a painting of a landscape may appeal to us over and above its
inherent beauty because we are already, out of actual experience, familiar with the scene it
represents, and the sight of it wakens in our memory a train of pleasant allied associations.
A ruined tower, in itself an exquisite composition in color and line and mass, may gather about
it suggestions of romance, elemental passions and wild life, and may epitomize for the beholder
the whole Middle Age. Associated interest, therefore, may be sentimental or intellectual. It
may be sensuous also, appealing to other senses than those of sight. The sense of touch plays
a large part in our enjoyment of the world. We like the "feel" of objects, the catch of raw
silk, the chill smoothness of burnished brass, the thick softness of mists, the "amorous wet"
of green depths of sea. The senses of taste and smell may be excited imaginatively and contribute
to our pleasure. Winslow Homer's breakers bring back to us the salt fragrance of the ocean,
and in the presence of these white mad surges we feel the stinging spray in our faces and we
taste the cosmic exhilaration of the sea-wind. But the final meaning of a picture resides in
the total harmony of color and form, a harmony into which we can project our whole personality
and which itself constitutes the emotional experience.

All language in its material aspect has a sensuous value, as the wealth of color of Venetian
painting, the sumptuousness of Renaissance architecture, the melody of Mr. Swinburne's verse,
the gem-like brilliance of Stevenson's prose, the all-inclusive sensuousness, touched with
sensuality, of Wagner's music-dramas. Because of the charm of beautiful language there are
many art-lovers who regard the sensuous qualities of the work itself as making up the entire
experience. Apart from any consideration of intention or expressiveness, the material thing
which the artist's touch summons into form is held to be "its own excuse for being."

This order of enjoyment, valid as far as it goes, falls short of complete appreciation. It
does not pass the delight one has in the radiance of gems or the glowing tincture of some fabric.
The element of meaning does not enter in. There is a beauty for the eye and a beauty for the
mind. The qualities of material may give pleasure to the senses; the object embodying these
qualities becomes beautiful only as it is endowed with a significance wakened in the human
spirit. A landscape, says Walter Crane, "owes a great part of its beauty to the harmonious
relation of its leading lines, or to certain pleasant contrasts, or a certain impressiveness
of form and mass, and at the same time we shall perceive that this linear expression is inseparable
from the sentiment or emotion suggested by that particular scene." In the appreciation of art,
to stop with the sensuous appeal of the medium is to mistake means for an end. An artist's
color, glorious or tender, is only a symbol and manifestation to sense of his emotion. At first
glance Titian's portrait of the "Man with the Glove" is an ineffable color-harmony. But truly
seen it is infinitely more. By means of color and formal design Titian has embodied here his
vision of superb young manhood; by the expressive power of his material symbols he has rendered
visible his sense of dignity, of fineness, of strength in reserve. The color is beautiful because
his idea was beautiful. Through the character of this young man as revealed and interpreted
by the artist, the beholder is brought into contact with a vital personality, whose influence
is communicated to him; in the appreciation of Titian's message he sees and feels and lives.

The value of the medium resided not in the material itself but in its power for expression.
When language is elaborated at the expense of the meaning, we have in so far forth sham art.
It should be easy to distinguish in art between what is vital and what is mechanical. The mechanical
is the product of mere execution and calls attention to the manner. The vital is born out of
inspiration, and the living idea transmutes its material into emotion. Too great an effort
at realization defeats the intended illusion, for we think only of the skill exercised to effect
the result, and the operation of the intellect inhibits feeling. In the greatest art the medium
is least perceived, and the beholder stands immediately in the presence of the artist's idea.
The material is necessarily fixed and finite; the idea struggles to free itself from its medium
and untrammeled to reach the spirit. It is mind speaking to mind. However complete the material
expression may seem, it is only a part of what the artist would say; imagination transcends
the actual.  In the art which goes deepest into life, the medium is necessarily inadequate.
The artist fashions his work in a sublime despair as he feels how little of the mighty meaning
within him he is able to convey. In the greatest works rightly seen the medium becomes transparent.
Within the Sistine Chapel the visitor, when once he has yielded to the illusion, is not conscious
of plaster surface and pigment; indeed, he hardly sees color and design as such at all; through
them he looks into the immensity of heaven, peopled with gods and godlike men. Consummate acting
is that which makes the spectator forget that it is acting. The part and the player become
one. The actor, in himself and in the words he utters, is the unregarded vehicle of the dramatist's
idea. In a play like Ibsen's "Ghosts," the stage, the actors, the dialogue merge and fall away,
and the overwhelming meaning stands revealed in its complete intensity. As the play opens,
it cuts out a segment from the chaos of human life; step by step it excludes all that is unessential,
stroke by stroke with an inevitableness that is crushing, it converges to the great one-thing
that the dramatist wanted to say, until at the end the spectator, conscious no longer of the
medium but only of the idea and all-resolving emotion, bows down before its overmastering force
with the cry, "What a mind is there!"

In the art which most completely achieves expression the medium is not perceived as distinct
from the emotion of which the medium is the embodiment. In order to render expressive the material
employed in its service, art seeks constantly to identify means and end, to make the form one
with the content. The wayfarer out of his need of shelter built a hut, using the material which
chance gave into his hand and shaping his design according to his resources; the purpose of
his work was not the hut itself but shelter. So the artist in any form is impelled to creation
by his need of expression; the thing which he creates is not the purpose and end of his effort,
but only the means. Each art has its special medium, and each medium has its peculiar sensuous
charm and its own kind of expressiveness. This power of sensuous delight is incidental to the
real beauty of the work; and that beauty is the message the work is framed to convey to the
spirit. In the individual work, the inspiring and shaping idea seeks so to fuse its material
that we feel the idea could not have been phrased in any other way as we surrender to its ultimate
appeal,--the sum of the emotional content which gave it birth and in which it reaches its fulfillment.

THE BACKGROUND OF ART

SCENE: The main hall of the Accademia in Venice.

Time: Noon of a July day.

Dramatis personae: A guide; two drab-colored and tired men; a group of women, of various ages,
equipped with red-covered little volumes, and severally expressive of great earnestness, wide-eyed
rapture, and giggles.

The guide, in strident, accentless tones: Last work of Titian. Ninety-nine years old. He died
of smallpox.

A woman: Is that it?

A high voice on the outskirts: I'm going to get one for forty dollars.

Another voice: Well, I'm not going to pay more than fifty for mine.

A straggler: Eliza, look at those people. Oh, you missed it! (Stopping suddenly?) My, isn't
that lovely!

Chorus: Yes, that's Paris Bordone. Which one is that? He has magnificent color.

The guide: The thing you want to look at is the five figures in front.

A voice: Oh, that's beautiful. I love that.

A man: Foreshortened; well, I should say so! But I say, you can't remember all these pictures.

The other man: Let's get out of this!

The guide, indicating a picture of the Grand Canal: This one has been restored.

A girl's voice: Why, that's the house where we are staying!

The guide: The next picture . . .

The squad shuffles out of range.

This little comedy, enacted in fact and here faithfully reported, is not without its pathos.
These people are "studying art." They really want to understand, and if possible, to enjoy.
They have visited galleries and seen many pictures, and they will visit other galleries and
see many more pictures before their return home. They have read guide-books, noting the stars
and double stars; they have dipped into histories of art and volumes of criticism. They have
been told to observe the dramatic force of Giotto, the line of Botticelli, the perfect composition
of Raphael, the color of Titian; all this they have done punctiliously. They know in a vague
way that Giotto was much earlier than Raphael, that Botticelli was rather pagan than Christian,
that Titian belonged to the Venetian school. They have come to the fountain head of art, the
very works themselves as gathered in the galleries; they have tried to remember what they have
read and to do what they have been told; and now they are left still perplexed and unsatisfied.

The difficulty is that these earnest seekers after knowledge of art have laid hold on partial
truths, but they have failed to see these partial truths in their right relation to the whole.
The period in which an artist lived means something. His way of thinking and feeling means
something. The quality of his color means something. But what does his picture mean? These
people have not quite found the key by which to piece the fragments of the puzzle into the
complete design. They miss the central fact with regard to art; and as a consequence, the ways
of approach to the full enjoyment of art, instead of bringing them nearer the centre, become
for them a network of by-paths in which they enmesh themselves, and they are left to wander
helplessly up and down and about in the blind-alleys of the labyrinth. The central fact with
regard to art is this, that a work of art is the expression of some part of the artist's experience
of life, his vision of some aspect of the world. For the appreciator, the work takes on a meaning
as it becomes for him in his turn the expression of his own actual or possible experience and
thus relates itself by the subtle links of feeling to his own life. This is the central fact;
but there are side issues. Any single work of art is in itself necessarily finite. Because
of limitations in both the artist and the appreciator the work cannot express immediately and
completely of itself all that the author wished to convey; it can present but a single facet
of his many-sided radiating personality. What is actually said may be reinforced by some understanding
on the beholder's part of what was intended. In order to win its fullest message, therefore,
the appreciator must set the work against the large background out of which it has proceeded.

A visitor in the Salon Carré of the Louvre notes that there are arrayed before him pictures
by Jan van Eyck and Memling, Raphael and Leonardo, Giorgione and Titian, Rembrandt and Metsu,
Rubens and Van Dyck, Fouquet and Poussin, Velasquez and Murillo. Each one bears the distinctive
impress of its creator. How different some of them, one from another,--the Virgin of Van Eyck
from the Virgin of Raphael, Rembrandt's "Pilgrimsat Emmaus" from the "Entombment" by Titian.
Yet between others there are common elements of likeness. Raphael and Titian are distinguished
by an opulence of form and a luxuriance of color which reveal supreme technical accomplishment
in a fertile land under light-impregnated skies. The rigidity and restraint of Van Eyck and
Memling suggest the tentative early efforts of the art of a sober northern race. To a thoughtful
student of these pictures sooner or later the question comes, Whence are these likenesses and
these differences?

Hitherto I have referred to the creative mind and executive hand as generically the artist.
I have thought of him as a type, representative of all the great class of those who feel and
express, and who by means of their expression communicate their feeling. Similarly I have spoken
of the work of art, as though it were complete in itself and isolated, sprung full-formed and
panoplied from the brain of its creator, able to win its way and consummate its destiny alone.
The type is conceived intellectually; in actual life the type resolves itself into individuals.
So there are individual artists, each with his own distinctive gifts and ideals, each with
his own separate experience of life, with his personal and special vision of the world, and
his characteristic manner of expression. Similarly, a single work of art is not an isolated
phenomenon; it is only a part of the artist's total performance, and to these other works it
must be referred. The kind of work an artist sets himself to do is determined to some extent
by the period into which he was born and the country in which he lived. The artist himself,
heir to the achievements of his predecessors, is a development, and his work is the product
of an evolution. A work of art, therefore, to be judged aright and truly appreciated, must
be seen in its relation to its background, from which it detaches itself at the moment of consideration,--the
background of the artist's personality and accomplishment and of the national life and ideals
of his time.

If the layman's interest in art is more than the casual touch-and-go of a picture here, a concert
there, and an entertaining book of an evening, he is confronted with the important matter of
the study of art as it manifests itself through the ages and in diverse lands. It is not a
question of practicing an art himself, for technical skill lies outside his province. The study
of art in the sense proposed has to do with the consideration of an individual work in its
relation to all the factors that have entered into its production. The work of an artist is
profoundly influenced by the national ideals and way of life of his race and of his age. The
art of Catholic Italy is ecclesiastical; the art of the Protestant North is domestic and individual.
The actual form an artist's work assumes is modified by the resources at his disposal,--resources
both of material and of technical methods. Raphael may have no more to say than Giotto had,
but he is able to express himself in a fuller and more finished way, because in his time the
language of painting had become richer and more varied and the rhetoric of it had been carried
to a farther point of development. Finally, as all art is in essence the expression of personality,
a single work is to be understood in its widest intention and scope by reference to the total
personality of the individual artist as manifested in his work collectively, and to be interpreted
by the appreciator through his knowledge of the artist's experience of life.

In order to wrest its fullest expressiveness from a work of art it is necessary as far as possible
to regard the work from the artist's own point of view. We must try to see with his eyes and
to feel with him what he was working for. To this end we must reconstruct imaginatively on
a basis of the facts the conditions in which he lived and wrought. The difference between Giotto
and Raphael is a difference not of individuality only. Each gives expression to the ideals
and ways of thought of his age. Each is a creative mind, but each bases his performance upon
what has gone before, and the form of their work is conditioned by the resources each had at
his disposal. To discover the artist's purpose more completely than he was able to realize
it for himself in the single work,--that is the aim and function of the historical study of
art. A brief review of the achievement of Giotto and of Raphael may serve to illustrate concretely
the application of the principle and to fix its value to appreciation.

In the period of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire art passed from Rome to Byzantium.
The arts of sculpture and painting were employed in the service of the Church, imposing by
its magnificence and all-powerful in its domination over the lives and minds of men. The function
of art was to teach; its character was symbolic and decorative. Art had no separate and independent
existence. It had no direct reference to nature; the pictorial representation of individual
traits was quite outside its scope; a few signs fixed by convention sufficed. A fish--derived
from the acrostic ichtbus--symbolized the Saviour; a cross was the visible token of redeeming
grace. And so through several hundred years. The twelfth century saw the beginnings of a change
in the direction of spiritual and intellectual emancipation. The teachings and example of Francis
of Assisi brought men to the consciousness of themselves and to a realization of the worth
and significance of the individual life. The work of Giotto is the expression in art of the
new spirit.

Of necessity Giotto founded his work upon the accepted forms of the Byzantine tradition. But
Giotto was a man of genius and a creative mind. In the expression of his fresh impulse and
vital feeling, the assertion of new-found individuality, he tried to realize as convincingly
and vividly as possible the situation with which he was dealing; and with this purpose he looked
not back upon art but out upon nature. Where the Byzantine convention had presented but a sign
and remote indication of form by means of flat color, Giotto endows his figures with life and
movement and actuality by giving them a body in three dimensions; his forms exist in the round.
Until his day, light and shade had not been employed; and such perspective as he was able to
achieve he had to discover for himself. For the first time in Christian painting a figure has
bodily existence. Giotto gives the first evidence, too, of a sense of the beauty of color,
and of the value of movement as a means of added expressiveness. His power of composition shows
an immense advance on his predecessors. In dealing with traditional subjects, as the Madonna
and child, he follows in general the traditional arrangement. But in those subjects where his
own inventiveness is given free play, as in the series of frescoes illustrating the life of
St. Francis, he reveals an extraordinary faculty of design and a dramatic sense which is matched
by a directness and clarity of expression.

Not only in the technique of his craft was Giotto an innovator, but also in the direction of
naturalness and reality of feeling. He was the first to introduce portraits into his work.
His Madonnas and saints are no longer mere types; they are human and individual, vividly felt
and characterized by immediate and present actuality. Giotto was the first realist, but he
was a poet too. His insight into life is tempered by a deep sincerity and piety; his work is
genuinely and powerfully felt. As a man Giotto was reverent and earnest, joyous and beautifully
sane. As a painter, by force of the freshness of his impulse and the clarity of his vision,
he created a new manner of expression. As an artist he reveals a true power of imaginative
interpretation. The casual spectator of to-day finds him naive and quaint. In the eyes of his
contemporaries he was anything but that; they regarded him as a marvel of reality, surpassing
nature itself. When judged with reference to the conditions of life in which he worked and
to the technical resources at his command, Giotto is seen to be of a very high order of creative
mind.

The year 1300 divides the life of Giotto into two nearly equal parts; the year 1500 similarly
divides the life of Raphael. In the two centuries that intervene, the great age of Italian
painting, initiated by Giotto, reaches its flower and perfection in Michelangelo, Leonardo,
and Raphael. The years which followed the passing of these greatnesses were the years of decadence
and eclipse. If we are to understand and justly appreciate the work of each man in its own
kind, the painting of Giotto must be tried by other standards than those we apply to the judgment
of Raphael. Giotto was a pioneer; Raphael is a consummation. The two centuries between were
a period of development and change, a development in all that regards technique, a change in
national ideals and in the artist's attitude toward life and toward his art. A quick survey
of the period, if so hasty a generalization permits correctness of statement, will help us
in the understanding of the craft and art of Raphael.

Giotto was succeeded by a host of lesser men, regarded as his followers, men who sought to
apply the principles and methods of painting worked out by the master, but who lacked his inspiration
and his power. Thus it was for nearly a hundred years. The turn of the fourteenth century into
the fifteenth saw the emergence of new forces in the science and the mechanics of painting.
The laws of perspective and foreshortening were made the object of special research and practice
by men like Uccello (1397-1475), Piero dei Franceschi (1416-1492), and Mantegna (1431-1506).
"Oh, what a beautiful thing this perspective is!" Uccello exclaimed, as he stood at his desk
between midnight and dawn while his wife begged him to take some rest. In the first thirty
years of the fifteenth century, Masaccio contributed to the knowledge of anatomy by his painting
of the nude form; and the study of the nude was continued by Pollaiuolo and Luca Signorelli,
in the second half of the century. Masaccio, also, was the first to place his figures in air,
enveloping them in atmosphere. Verrocchio, a generation later than Masaccio, was one of the
first of the Florentines to understand landscape and the part played in it by air and light.
The realistic spirit, which suffices itself with subjects drawn from every-day actual experience,
finds expression in the first half of the fifteenth century in the work of Andrea del Castagno.
And so down through that century of spring and summer. Each painter in his own way carries
some detail of his craft to a further point of development and prepares the path for the supreme
triumphs of Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Raphael.

The growing mastery of the principles and technique of painting accompanied a change in the
painter's attitude toward his art. Originally, painting, applied in subjection to architecture
and employed in the service of the Church, was decorative in scope; its purpose was illustration,
its function was to teach. As painters, from generation to generation, went deeper into the
secrets of their craft, they became less interested in the didactic import of their work, and
they concerned themselves more and more with its purely artistic significance. Religious subjects
were no longer used merely as symbols for the expression of piety and as incitements to devotion;
they became inherently artistic motives, valued as they furnished the artist an opportunity
for the exercise of his knowledge and skill and for the exhibition of lovely color and significant
form. A change in the mechanical methods of painting, also, had its influence on a change in
the conception of the function of art. With a very few exceptions, the works of Giotto were
executed in fresco as wall decorations. The principles of mural painting require that the composition
shall be subordinated to the architectural conditions of the space it is to fill and that the
color shall be kept flat. The fresco method meets these requirements admirably, but because
of its flatness it has its limitations. The introduction of an oil vehicle for the pigment
material, in the fifteenth century, made possible a much greater range in gradated color, and
reinforcing the increased knowledge of light and shade, aided in the evolution of decoration
into the "easel picture," complete in itself. Released from its subjection to architecture,
increasing its technical resources, and widening its interests in the matter of subject so
as to include all life, painting becomes an independent and self-sufficing art.

Coincident with the development of painting as a craft, a mighty change was working itself
out in the national ideals and in men's ways of thought and feeling. Already in Giotto's time
the spirit of individualism had begun to assert itself in reaction from the dominance of an
all-powerful restrictive ecclesiasticism, but the age was still essentially pietistic and according
to its lights, religious. The fifteenth century witnessed the emancipation from tradition.
The new humanism, which took its rise with the rediscovery of Greek culture, extended the intellectual
horizon and intensified the enthusiasm for beauty. Men's interest in life was no longer narrowly
religious, but human; their art became the expression of the new spirit. Early Christianity
had been ascetic, enjoining negation of life and the mortification of the flesh. The men of
the Renaissance, with something of the feeling of the elder Greeks, glorified the body and
delighted in the pride of life. Pagan myths and Greek legends take their place alongside of
Bible episodes and stories of saints and martyrs, as subjects of representation; all served
equally as motives for the expression of the artist's sense of the beauty of this world.

To this new culture and to these two centuries of growth and accomplishment in the practice
of painting Raphael was heir. With a knowledge of the background out of which he emerges, we
are prepared now to understand and appreciate his individual achievement. In approaching the
study of his work we may ask, What is in general his ideal, his dominant motive, and in what
manner and by what means has he realized his ideal?

How much was already prepared for him, what does he owe to the age and the conditions in which
he worked, and what to the common store has he added that is peculiarly his own?

Whereas Giotto, the shepherd boy, was a pioneer, almost solitary, by sheer force of mind and
by his sincerity and intensity of feeling breaking new paths to expression, for Raphael, on
the contrary, the son of a painter and poet, the fellow-worker and well-beloved friend of many
of the most powerful artistic personalities of his own or any age, the way was already prepared
along which he moved in triumphant progress. The life of Raphael as an artist extends through
three well-defined periods, the Umbrian, the Florentine, and the Roman, each one of which contributed
a distinctive influence upon his development and witnessed a special and characteristic achievement.

To his father, who died when the boy was eleven years old, Raphael owed his poetic nature,
scholarly tastes, and love of beauty, though he probably received from him no training as a
painter. His first master was Timoteo Viti of Urbino, a pupil of Francia; from him he learned
drawing and acquired a "certain predilection for round and opulent forms which is in itself
the negation of the ascetic ideal." At the age of seventeen he went from Urbino to Perugia;
there he entered the workshop of Perugino as an assistant. The ideal of the Umbrian school
was tenderness and sweetness, the outward and visible rapture of pietistic feeling; something
of these qualities Raphael expressed in his Madonnas throughout his career. Under the teaching
of Perugino he laid hold on the principles of "space composition" which he was afterwards to
carry to supreme perfection.

From Perugia the young Raphael made his way to Florence, and here he underwent many influences.
At that moment Florence was the capital city of Italian culture. It was here that the new humanism
had come to finest flower. Scholarship was the fashion; art was the chief interest of this
beauty-loving people. It was the Florentines who had carried the scientific principles of painting
to their highest point of development, particularly in their application to the rendering of
the human figure. In Florence were collected the art treasures of the splendid century; here
Michelangelo and Leonardo were at work; here were gathered companies of lesser men. By the
study of Masaccio Raphael was led out to a fresh contact with nature. Fra Bartolomeo revealed
to him further possibilities of composition and taught him some of the secrets of color. In
Florence, too, he acknowledged the spell of Michelangelo and Leonardo. But though he learned
from many teachers, Raphael was never merely an imitator. His scholarship and his skill he
turned to his own uses; and when we have traced the sources of his motives and the influences
in the moulding of his manner, there emerges out of the fusion a creative new force, which
is his genius. What remains after our analysis is the essential Raphael.

Raphael's residence in Florence is the period of his Madonnas. From Florence Raphael, twenty-five
years old and now a master in his own right, was summoned to Rome by Pope Julius II; and here
he placed his talents and his mastership at the disposal of the Church. He found time to paint
Madonnas and a series of powerful and lovely portraits; but these years in Rome, which brought
his brief life to a close, are preeminently the period of the great frescoes, which are his
supreme achievement. But even in these mature years, and though he was himself the founder
of a school, he did not cease to learn. Michelangelo was already in Rome, and now Raphael came
more immediately under his influence, although not to submit to it but to use it for his own
ends. In Rome were revealed to him the culture of an older and riper civilization and the glories
and perfectness of an elder art. Raphael laid antiquity under contribution to the consummation
of his art and the fulfillment and complete realization of his genius.

This analysis of the elements and influences of Raphael's career as an artist--inadequate as
it necessarily is--may help us to define his distinctive accomplishment. A comparison of his
work with that of his predecessors and contemporaries serves to disengage his essential significance.
By nature he was generous and tender; the bent of his mind was scholarly; and he was impelled
by a passion for restrained and formal beauty. Chiefly characteristic of his mental make-up
was his power of assimilation, which allowed him to respond to many and diverse influences
and in the end to dominate and use them. He gathered up in himself the achievements of two
centuries of experiment and progress, and fusing the various elements, he created by force
of his genius a new result and stamped it with the seal perfection. Giotto, to whom religion
was a reality, was deeply in earnest about his message, and he phrased it as best he could
with the means at his command; his end was expression. Raphael, under the patronage of wealthy
dilettanti and in the service of a worldly and splendor-loving Church, delighted in his knowledge
and his skill; he worshiped art, and his end was beauty. The genius of Giotto is a first shoot,
vigorous and alive, breaking ground hardily, and tentatively pushing into freer air. The genius
of Raphael is the full-blown flower and final fruit, complete, mature. The step beyond is decay.

By reference to Giotto and to Raphael I have tried to illustrate the practical application
of certain principles of art study. A work of art is not absolute; both its content and its
form are determined by the conditions out of which it proceeds. All judgment, therefore, must
be comparative, and a work of art must be considered in its relation to its background and
its conventions. Art is an interpretation of some aspect of life as the artist has felt it;
and the artist is a child of his time. It is not an accident that Raphael portrayed Madonnas,
serene and glorified, and Millet pictured rude peasants bent with toil. Raphael's painting
is the culmination of two centuries of eager striving after the adequate expression of religious
sentiment; in Millet's work the realism of his age is transfigured. As showing further how
national ideals and interests may influence individual production, we may note that the characteristic
art of the Italian Renaissance is painting; and Italian sculpture of the period is pictorial
rather than plastic in motive and handling. Ghiberti's doors of the Florence Baptistery, in
the grouping of figures and the three and four planes in perspective of the backgrounds, are
essentially pictures in bronze. Conversely, in the North the characteristic art of the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries is carving and sculpture; and "the early painters represented in their
pictures what they were familiar with in wood and stone; so that not only are the figures dry
and hard, but in the groups they are packed one behind another, heads above heads, without
really occupying space, in imitation of the method adopted in the carved relief." Some knowledge
of the origin and development of a given form of technique, a knowledge to be reached through
historical study, enables us to measure the degree of expressiveness of a given work. The ideas
of a child may be very well worth listening to, though his range of words is limited and his
sentences are crude and halting, A grown man, having acquired the trick of language, may talk
fluently and say nothing. In our endeavor to understand a work of art, a poem by Chaucer or
by Tennyson, a picture by Greco or by Manet, a prelude by Bach or a symphony by Brahms, we
may ask, Of that which the artist wanted to say, how much could he say with the means at his
disposal? With a sense of the artist's larger motive, whether religious sentiment, or a love
of sheer beauty of color and form, or insight into human character, we are aided by a study
of the history of technique to determine how far the artist with the language at his command
was able to realize his intention.

But not only is art inspired and directed by the time-spirit of its age. A single work is the
expression for the artist who creates it of his ideal. An artist's ideal, what he sets himself
to accomplish, is the projection of his personality, and that is determined by many influences.
He is first of all a child of his race and time; inheritance and training shape him to these
larger conditions. Then his ideal is modified by his special individuality. A study of the
artist's character as revealed in his biography leads to a fuller understanding of the intention
and scope of his work. The events of his life become significant as they are seen to be the
causes or the results of his total personality, that which he was in mind and temperament.
What were the circumstances that moulded his character and decided his course? What events
did he shape to his own purpose by the active force of his genius? What was the special angle
of vision from which he looked upon the world? The answers to these questions are the clue
to the full drift of his work. As style is the expression of the man, so conversely a knowledge
of the man is an entrance into the wider and subtler implications of his style. We explore
the personality of the man in order more amply to interpret his art, and we turn to his art
as the revelation of his personality. In studying an artist we must look for his tendency and
seek the unifying principle which binds his separate works into a whole. An artist has his
successive periods or "manners." There is the period of apprenticeship, when the young man
is influenced by his predecessors and his masters. Then he comes into his own, and he registers
nature and life as he sees it freshly for himself. Finally, as he has mastered his art and
won some of the secrets of nature, and as his own character develops, he tends more and more
to impose his subjective vision upon the world, and he subordinates nature to the expression
of his distinctive individuality. A single work, therefore, is to be considered in relation
to its place in the artist's development; it is but a part, and it is to be interpreted by
reference to the whole.

In the study of biography, however, the man must not be mistaken for the artist; his acts are
not to be confounded with his message. "A man is the spirit he worked in; not what he did,
but what he became." We must summon forth the spirit of the man from within the wrappages of
material and accident. In our preoccupation with the external details of a man's familiar and
daily life it is easy to lose sight of his spiritual experience, which only is of significance.
Whistler, vain, aggressive, quarrelsome, and yet so exquisite and so subtle in extreme refinement,
is a notable example of a great spirit and a little man. Wagner wrote to Liszt: "As I have
never felt the real bliss of love, I must erect a monument to the most beautiful of my dreams,
in which from beginning to end that love shall be thoroughly satiated." Not the Wagner of fact,
but the Wagner of dreams. Life lived in the spirit and imagination may be different from the
life of daily act. So we should transcend the material, trying through that to penetrate to
the spiritual. It is not a visit to the artist's birthplace that signifies, it is not to do
reverence before his likeness or cherish a bit of his handwriting. All this may have a value
to the disciple as a matter of loyalty and fine piety. But in the end we must go beyond these
externals that we may enter intelligently and sympathetically into the temper of his mind and
mood and there find disclosed what he thought and felt and was able only in part to express.
It is not the man his neighbors knew that is important. His work is the essential thing, what
that work has to tell us about life in terms of emotional experience.

Studies in the history of art and in biography are avenues of approach to the understanding
of a work of art; they do not in themselves constitute appreciation. Historical importance
must not be mistaken for artistic significance. In reading about pictures we may forget to
look at them. The historical study of art in its various divisions reduces itself to an exercise
in analysis, resolving a given work into its elements. But art is a synthesis. In order to
appreciate a work the elements must be gathered together and fused into a whole. A statue or
a picture is meant not to be read about, but to be looked at; and its final message must be
received through vision. Our knowledge will serve us little if we are not sensitive to the
appeal of color and form. There is danger that preoccupation with the history of art may betray
us if we are not careful to keep it in its place. The study of art should follow and not lead
appreciation. We are apt to see what we are looking for. So we ought to come to each work freshly
without prejudice or bias; it is only afterwards that we should bring to bear on it our knowledge
about the facts of its production. Connoisseurship is a science and may hold within itself
no element of aesthetic enjoyment. Appreciation is an art, and the quality of it depends upon
the appreciator himself. The end of historical study is not a knowledge of facts for their
own sake, but through those facts a deeper penetration and fuller true enjoyment. By the aid
of such knowledge we are enabled to recognize in any work more certainly and abundantly the
expression of an emotional experience which relates itself to our own life.

The final meaning of art to the appreciator lies in just this sense of its relation to his
own experience. The greatest works are those which express reality and life, not limited and
temporary conditions, but life universal and for all time. Without commentary these carry their
message, appealing to the wisest and the humblest. Gather into a single room a fragment of
the Parthenon frieze, Michelangelo's "Day and Night," Botticelli's "Spring," the sprites and
children of Donatello and Delia Robbia, Velasquez's "Pope Innocent," Rembrandt's "Cloth-weavers,"
Frans Hals' "Musician," Millet's "Sower," Whistler's "Carlyle." There is here no thought of
period or of school. These living, present, eternal verities are all one company.

VI

THE SERVICE OF CRITICISM

THE greatest art is universal. It transcends the merely local conditions in which it is produced.
It sweeps beyond the individual personality of its creator, and links itself with the common
experience of all men. The Parthenon, so far as it can be reconstructed in imagination, appeals
to a man of any race or any period, whatever his habit of mind or degree of culture, as a perfect
utterance. The narrow vault of the Sistine Chapel opens into immensity, and every one who looks
upon it is lifted out of himself into new worlds. Shakespeare's plays were enjoyed by the apprentices
in the pit and royalty in the boxes, and so all the way between. The man Shakespeare, of such
and such birth and training, and of this or that experience in life, is entirely merged in
his creations; he becomes the impersonal channel of expression of the profoundest, widest interpretation
of life the world has known. Such art as this comes closest to the earth and extends farthest
into infinity, "beyond the reaches of our souls."

But there is another order of art, more immediately the product of local conditions, the personal
expression of a distinctive individuality, phrased in a language of less scope and currency,
and limited as to its content in the range of its appeal. These lesser works have their place;
they can minister to us in some moment of need and at some point in our development. Because
of their limitations, however, their effectiveness can be furthered by interpretation. A man
more sensitive than we to the special kind of beauty which they embody and better versed in
their language, can discover to us a significance and a charm in them to which we have not
penetrated. To help us to the fullest enjoyment of the great things and to a more enlightened
and juster appreciation of the lesser works is the service of criticism.

We do not wholly possess an experience until, having merged ourselves in it, we then react
upon it and become conscious of its significance. A novel, a play, a picture interests us,
and we surrender to the enjoyment of the moment. Afterwards we think about our pleasure, defining
the nature of the experience and analyzing the means by which it was produced, the subject
of the work and the artist's method of treating it. It may be that we tell our pleasure to
a friend, glad also perhaps to hear his opinion of the matter. The impulse is natural; the
practice is helpful. And herein lies the origin of criticism. In so far as an appreciator does
not rest in his immediate enjoyment of a work of art, but seeks to account for his pleasure,
to trace the sources of it, to establish the reasons for it, and to define its quality, so
far he becomes a critic. As every man who perceives beauty in nature and takes it up into his
own life is potentially an artist, so every man is a critic in the measure that he reasons
about his enjoyment. The critical processes, therefore, are an essential part of our total
experience of art, and criticism may be an aid to appreciation.

The function of criticism has been variously understood through the centuries of its practice.
Early modern criticism, harking back to the method of Aristotle, concerned itself with the
form of a work of art. From the usage of classic writers it deduced certain "rules" of composition;
these formulas were applied to the work under examination, and that was adjudged good or bad
in the degree that it conformed or failed to conform to the established rules. It was a criticism
of law-giving and of judgment. In the eighteenth century criticism extended its scope by the
admission of a new consideration, passing beyond the mere form of the work and reckoning with
its power to give pleasure. Addison, in his critique of "Paradise Lost," still applies the
formal tests of the Aristotelian canons, but he discovers further that a work of art exists
not only for the sake of its form, but also for the expression of beautiful ideas. This power
of "affecting the imagination" he declares is the "very life and highest perfection" of poetry.
This is a long step in the right direction. With the nineteenth century, criticism conceives
its aims and procedure in new and larger ways. A work of art is now seen to be an evolution;
and criticism adapts to its own uses the principles of historical study and the methods of
scientific investigation. Recognizing that art is organic, that an art-form, as religious painting
or Gothic architecture or the novel, is born, develops, comes to maturity, lapses, and dies,
that an individual work is the product of "race, environment, and the moment," that it is the
expression also of the personality of the artist himself, criticism no longer regards the single
work as an isolated phenomenon, but tries to see it in its relation to its total background.

Present-day criticism avails itself of this larger outlook upon art. But the ends to be reached
are understood differently by different critics. With M. Brunetière, to cite now a few representative
names, criticism is authoritative and dogmatic: he looks at the work objectively, refusing
to be the dupe of his pleasure, if he has any; and approaching the work in the spirit of dispassionate
impersonal inquiry as an object of historical importance and scientific interest, he decrees
that it is good or bad. Matthew Arnold considers literature a "criticism of life," and he values
a work with reference to the moral significance of its ideas. Ruskin's criticism is didactic;
he wishes to educate his public, and by force of his torrential eloquence he succeeds in persuading
his disciples into acceptance of his teaching, though he may not always convince. Impressionistic
criticism, as with M. Anatole France or M. Jules Lemaître, does not even try to see the work
"as in itself it really is," but is an account of the critic's own subjective reaction on it,
a narrative of what he thought and felt in this chance corner of experience. With Walter Pater
criticism becomes appreciation. A given work of art produces a distinctive impression and communicates
a special and unique pleasure; this active power constitutes its beauty. The interpretative
critic--represented in the practice of Pater--stands between a work of art and the appreciator
as mediator and revealer.

Each kind of criticism performs a certain office, and is of use within its own chosen sphere.
To the layman, for his purposes of appreciation, that order of criticism will be most helpful
which responds most closely and amply to his peculiar needs. A work of art may be regarded
under several aspects, its quality of technical execution, its power of sensuous appeal, its
historical importance; and to each one of these aspects some kind of criticism applies. The
layman's reception of art includes all these considerations, but subordinates them to the total
experience. His concern, therefore, is to define the service of criticism to appreciation.

The analysis of a work of art resolves it into these elements. There is first of all the emotion
which gives birth to the work and which the work is designed to express. The emotion, to become
definite, gathers about an idea, conceived in the terms of its own medium, as form, or color
and mass, or musical relations; and this artistic idea presents itself as the subject or motive
of the work. The emotion and artistic idea, in order that they may be expressed and become
communicable, embody themselves in material, as the marble of a statue, the pigment of a picture,
the audible tones of a musical composition. This material form has the power to satisfy the
mind and delight the senses. Through the channel of the senses and the mind the work reaches
the feelings; and the aesthetic experience is complete.

As art springs out of emotion, so it is to be received as emotion; and a work to be appreciated
in its true spirit must be enjoyed. But to be completely enjoyed it must be understood. We
must know what the artist was trying to express, and we must be able to read his language;
then we are prepared to take delight in the form and to respond to the emotion.

To help us to understand a work of art in all the components that entered into the making of
it is the function of historical study. Such study enables us to see the work from the artist's
own point of view. A knowledge of its background, the conditions in which the artist wrought
and his own attitude toward life, is the clue to his ideal; and by an understanding of the
language it was possible for him to employ, we can measure the degree of expressiveness he
was able to achieve. This study of the artist's purpose and of his methods is an exercise in
explanation.

The interpretation of art, for which we look to criticism, deals with the picture, the statue,
the book, specifically in its relation to the appreciator. What is the special nature of the
experience which the work communicates to us in terms of feeling? In so far as the medium itself
is a source of pleasure, by what qualities of form has the work realized the conditions of
beauty proper to it, delighting thus the senses and satisfying the mind? These are the questions
which the critic, interpreting the work through the medium of his own temperament, seeks to answer.

Theoretically, the best critic of art would be the artist himself. He above all other men should
understand the subtle play of emotion and thought in which a work of art is conceived; and
the artist rather than another should trace the intricacies and know the cunning of the magician
processes by which the immaterial idea builds itself into visible actuality. In practice, however,
the theory is not borne out by the fact. The artist as such is very little conscious of the
workings of his spirit. He is creative rather than reflective, synthetic and not analytic.
From his contact with nature and from his experience of life, out of which rises his generative
emotion, he moves directly to the fashioning of expressive forms, without pausing on the way
to scan too closely the "meaning" of his work. Mr. Bernard Shaw remarks that Ibsen, giving
the rein to the creative impulse of his poetic nature, produced in "Brand" and "Peer Gynt"
a "great puzzle for his intellect." Wagner, he says, "has expressly described how the intellectual
activity which he brought to the analysis of his music dramas was in abeyance during their
creation. Just so do we find Ibsen, after composing his two great dramatic poems, entering
on a struggle to become intellectually conscious of what he had done." Moreover, the artist
is in the very nature of things committed to one way of seeing. His view of life is limited
by the trend of his own dominant and creative personality; what he gains in intensity and penetration
of insight he loses in breadth. He is less quick to see beauty in another guise than that which
his own imagination weaves for him; he is less receptive of other ways of envisaging the world.

The ideal critic, on the contrary, is above everything else catholic and tolerant. It is his
task to discover beauty in whatever form and to affirm it. By nature he is more sensitive than
the ordinary man, by training he has directed the exercise of his powers toward their fullest
scope, and by experience of art in its diverse manifestations he has certified his judgment
and deepened his capacity to enjoy. The qualifications of an authentic critic are both temperament
and scholarship. Mere temperament uncorrected by knowledge may vibrate exquisitely when swept
by the touch of a thing of beauty, but its music may be in a quite different key from the original
motive. Criticism must relate itself to the objective fact; it should interpret and not transpose.
Mere scholarship without temperament misses art at its centre, that art is the expression and
communication of emotional experience; and the scholar in criticism may wander his leaden way
down the by-paths of a sterile learning. To mediate between the artist and the appreciator,
the critic must understand the artist and he must feel with the appreciator. He is at once
the artist translated into simpler terms and the appreciator raised to a higher power of perception
and response.

The service of criticism to the layman is to furnish him a clue to the meaning of the work
in hand, and by the critic's own response to its beauty to reveal its potency and charm. With
technique as such the critic is not concerned. Technique is the business of the artist; only
those who themselves practice an art are qualified to judge in matters of practice. The form
is significant to the appreciator only so far as regards its expressiveness and beauty. It
is not the function of the critic to tell the artist what his work should be; it is the critic's
mission to reveal to the appreciator what the work is. That revelation will be accomplished
in terms of the critic's own experience of the beauty of the work, an experience imaged forth
in such phrases that the pleasure the work communicates is conveyed to his readers in its true
quality and foil intensity. It is not enough to dogmatize as Ruskin dogmatizes, to bully the
reader into a terrified acceptance. It is not enough to determine absolute values as Matthew
Arnold seeks to do, to fix certain canons of intellectual judgment, and by the application
of a formula as a touchstone, to decide that this work is excellent and that another is less
good. Really serviceable criticism is that which notes the special and distinguishing quality
of beauty in any work and helps the reader to live out that beauty in his own experience.

These generalizations may be made more immediate and practical by examples. In illustration
of the didactic manner in criticism I may cite a typical paragraph of Ruskin, chosen from his
"Mornings in Florence."

First, look at the two sepulchral slabs by which you are standing. That farther of the two
from the west end is one of the most beautiful pieces of fourteenth-century sculpture in this
world. . . . And now, here is a simple but most useful test of your capacity for understanding
Florentine sculpture or painting. If you can see that the lines of that cap are both right,
and lovely; that the choice of the folds is exquisite in its ornamental relations of line;
and that the softness and ease of them is complete,--though only sketched with a few dark touches,--then
you can understand Giotto's drawing, and Botticelli's;--Donatello's carving, and Luca's. But
if you see nothing in this sculpture, you will see nothing in theirs, of theirs. Where they
choose to imitate flesh, or silk, or to play any vulgar modern trick with marble--(and they
often do)--whatever, in a word, is French, or American, or Cockney, in their work, you can
see; but what is Florentine, and for ever great--unless you can see also the beauty of this
old man in his citizen's cap,--you will see never.

The earnest and docile though bewildered layman is intimidated into thinking that he sees it,
whether he really does or not. But it is a question if the contemplation of the "beauty of
this old man in his citizen's cap," however eager and serious the contemplation may be, adds
much to his experience; it may be doubted whether as a result of his effort toward the understanding
of the rightness and loveliness of the lines of the cap and the exquisiteness of the choice
of folds, which the critic has pointed out to him with threatening finger, he feels that life
is a fuller and finer thing to live.

An example of the intellectual estimate, the valuation by formulas, and the assignment of abstract
rank, is this paragraph from Matthew Arnold's essay on Wordsworth.

Thus does the judicial critic mete out his estimate by scale and measuring-rod. We are told
dogmatically what is good and what is less good; but of distinctive quality and energizing
life-giving virtues, not a word. The critic does not succeed in communicating to us anything
of Wordsworth's special charm and power. We are informed, but we are left cold and unresponding.

The didactic critic imposes his standard upon the layman. The judicial critic measures and
awards. The appreciative critic does not attempt to teach or to judge; he makes possible to
his reader an appreciation of the work of art simply by recreating in his own terms the complex
of his emotions in its presence. Instead of declaring the work to be beautiful or excellent,
he makes it beautiful in the very telling of what it means to him. As the artist interprets
life, disclosing its depths and harmonies, so the appreciative critic in his turn interprets
art, reconstituting the beauty of it in his own terms. Through his interpretation, the layman
is enabled to enter more fully into the true spirit of the work and to share its beauty in
his own experience.

In contrast to the passage from Arnold is this paragraph from an essay on Wordsworth by Walter
Pater.

Here is the clue to Wordsworth's meaning; and the special quality and power of his work, gathering
amplitude and intensity as it plays across the critic's temperament, is reconstituted in other
and illuminating images which communicate the emotion to us. The critic has felt more intimately
than we the appeal of this poetry, and he kindles in us something of his own enthusiasm. So
we return to Wordsworth for ourselves, more alert to divine his message, more susceptible to
his spell, that he may work in us the magic of evocation.

Criticism is of value to us as appreciators in so far as it serves to recreate in us the experience
which the work was designed to convey. But criticism is not a short cut to enjoyment. We cannot
take our pleasure at second hand. We must first come to the work freshly and realize our own
impression of it; then afterwards we may turn to the critic for a further revelation. Criticism
should not shape our opinion, but should stimulate appreciation, carrying us farther than we
could go ourselves, but always in the same direction with our original impression. There is
a kind of literary exercise, calling itself criticism, which takes a picture or a book as its
point of departure and proceeds to create a work of art in its own right, attaching itself
only in name to the work which it purports to criticise. A very good appreciation of Ruskin,
this. But the answer is that such writing as is here attributed to Ruskin is magnificent: it
may be art; but it is not true criticism. A work of art is not "impressive" merely, but "expressive"
too. Criticism in its relation to the work itself has an objective base, and it must be steadied
and authenticated by constant reference to the original feet. Criticism is not the source of
our enjoyment but a medium of interpretation.

Before we turn to criticism, therefore, we must first, as Pater suggests, know our own impression
as it really is, discriminate it, and realize it distinctly. Only so shall we escape becoming
the dupe of some more aggressive personality. In our mental life suggestion plays an important
and perhaps unrecognized part. In a certain frame of mind we can be persuaded into believing
anything and into liking anything. When, under the influence of authority or fashion, we think
we care for that which has no vital and consciously realized relation to our own experience,
we are the victims of a kind of hypnotism, and there is little hope of our ultimate adjustment
over against art. It is far better honestly to like an inferior work and know why we like it
than to pretend to like a good one. In the latter case no real progress or development is possible,
for we have no standards that can be regarded as final; we are swayed by the authority or influence
which happens at that moment to be most powerful. In the former case we are at least started
in the right direction. Year by year, according to the law of natural growth, we come to the
end of the inferior work which up to that time has been able to minister to us, and we pass
on to new and greater works that satisfy the demands of our deepening experience. It is sometimes
asked if we ought not to try to like the best things in art. I should answer, the very greatest
things we do not have to try to like; the accent of greatness is unmistakable, and greatness
has a message for every one. As regards the lesser works, we ought to be willing to grow up.
There was a time when I enjoyed "Robinson Crusoe" in words of one syllable. If I had tried
then to like Mr. George Meredith, I should not really have enjoyed him, and I should have missed
the fun of "Robinson Crusoe." Everything in its time and place. The lesser works have their
use: they may be a starting-point for our entrance into life; and they furnish a basis of comparison
by which we are enabled to realize the greatness of the truly great. We must value everything
in its own kind, affirming what it is, and not regretting what it is not. But the prerequisite
of all appreciation, without which our contact with art is a pastime or a pretense, is that
we be honest with ourselves. In playing solitaire at least we ought not to cheat.

So the layman must face the situation squarely and accept the responsibility of deciding finally
for himself. On the way we may look to criticism to guide us to those works which are meant
for us. In art as in the complex details of living, there is need of selection; and criticism
helps toward that. In literature alone, to name but a single art, there is so much to be left
unread which the length of our life would not otherwise permit us to escape, that we are grateful
to the critic who aids us to omit gracefully and with success. But the most serviceable criticism
is positive and not destructive. The lesser works may have a message for us, and it is that
message in its distinctive quality which the critic should affirm. In the end, however, the
use we make of criticism should not reduce itself to an unquestioning acceptance of authority.
In the ceremonial of the Roman service, at the moment preceding the elevation of the Host,
two acolytes enter the chancel, bearing candles, and kneel between the congregation and the
ministrants at the altar; the tapers, suffusing the altar in their golden radiance, throw the
dim figures of the priests into a greater gloom and mystery. So it happens that art often is
enshrouded by the off-giving of those who would seem to illuminate it; and "dark with excess
of light," the obscurity is intensified. The layman is told of the virginal poetry of early
Italian painting; he is bidden to sit at the homely, substantial feast of the frank actuality
of Dutch art; he listens in puzzled wonder to the glorification of Velasquez and Goya; he reads
in eloquent, glowing language of the splendor of Turner. He is more than half persuaded; but
he does not quite understand. From this tangle of contending interests there seems for the
moment to be no way out. It is assumed that the layman has no standard of his own; and he yields
himself to the appeal which comes to him immediately at the instant. The next day, perhaps,
brings a new interest or another judgment which runs counter to the old. Back and forth and
back again, without purpose and without reason; it is only an endless recurrence of the conflict
instead of development and progress. Taking all his estimates at second hand, so for his opinion
even of a concert or a play he is at the mercy of a critic who may have dined badly. Some boy,
caught young at the university and broken to miscellaneous tasks on a big newspaper, is sent
to "do" a picture-exhibition, a concert, and the theatre in the same day. He is expected to
"criticise" in an hour the work of a lifetime of struggle and effort and knowledge and thought
and feeling. This is the guide of opinion and the foundation of artistic creed. I have stated
the reduction to absurdity of the case for authority in criticism. If the layman who leans
too heavily upon criticism comes to realize the hopelessness of his position and thinks the
situation through to its necessary conclusion, he sees that the authority of criticism is not
absolute, but varies with the powers and range of the individual critic, and that at the last
he must find his standard within himself.

There are, of course, certain standards of excellence recognized universally and certain principles
of taste of universal validity; and to these standards and these principles must be referred
our individual estimates for comparison and correction. Given a native sensibility to the worth
of life and to the appeal of beauty, the justice of our estimate will be in proportion to the
extent of our knowledge of life and of our contact with art. Our individual judgment, therefore,
must be controlled by experience,--our momentary judgments by the sum of our own experience,
and our total judgment by universal experience. In all sound criticism and right appreciation
there must be a basis of disciplined taste. We must guard ourselves against whims and caprice,
even our own. So the individual may not cut loose altogether from external standards. But these
must be brought into relation to his personal needs and applied with reference to his own standard.
Finally, for his own uses, the individual has the right to determine the meaning and value
to him of any work of art in the measure that it links itself with his own actual or possible
experience and becomes for him a revelation of fuller life. For beauty is the power possessed
by objects to quicken us with a sense of larger personality; and art, whether the arts of form
or of representation, is the material bodying forth of beauty as the artist has perceived it
and the means by which his emotion in its presence is communicated. Upon this conception of
beauty and this interpretation of the scope and function of art rests the justice of the personal
estimate.

VII

BEAUTY AND COMMON LIFE

TO become sensitive to the meaning of color and form and sound as the artist employs them for
expression, to feel a work of art in its relation to its background, to find in criticism enlightenment
and guidance but not a substitute for one's own experience,--these are methods of approach
to art. But the appreciator has yet to penetrate art's inmost secret. At the centre, as the
motive of all his efforts to understand the language of art and the processes of technique,
as the goal of historical study and the purpose of his recourse to criticism, stands the work
itself with its power to attract and charm. Here is Millet's painting of the "Sower." In the
actual presence of the picture the appreciator's experience is complex. Analysis resolves it
into considerations of the material form of the work, involving its sensuous qualities and
the processes of execution, considerations also of the subject of the picture, which gathers
about itself many associations out of the beholder's own previous knowledge of life. But the
clue to the final meaning of the work, its meaning both to the artist and to the appreciator,
is contained in the answer to the question, Why did Millet paint this picture? And just what
is it designed to express?

Art is born out of emotion. Though the symbols it may employ to expression, the forms in which
it may manifest itself, are infinitely various in range and character, essentially all art
is one. A work of art is the material bodying forth of the artist's sense of a meaning in life
which unfolds itself to him as harmony and to which his spirit responds accordantly. It may
be a pattern he has conceived; or he adapts material to a new use in response to a new need:
the artist is here a craftsman. He is stirred by the tone and incident of a landscape or by
the force or charm of some personality: and he puts brush to canvas. He apprehends the complex
rhythms of form: and the mobile clay takes shape under his fingers. He feels the significance
of persons acting and reacting in their contact with one another: and he pens a novel or a
drama. He is thrilled by the emotion attending the influx of a great idea; philosophy is touched
with feeling: and the thinker becomes a poet. The discords of experience resolve themselves
within him into harmonies: and he gives them out in triumphant harmonies of sound. The particular
medium the artist chooses in which to express himself is incidental to the feeling to be conveyed.
The stimulus to emotion which impels the artist to create and the essential content of his
work is beauty. As beauty, then, is the very stuff and fibre of art, inextricably bound up
with it, so in our effort to relate art to our experience we may seek to know something of
the nature of beauty and its place in common life.

During a visit in Philadelphia I was conducted by a member of the firm through the great Locomotive
Works in that city. From the vast office, with its atmosphere of busy, concentrated quiet,
punctuated by the clicking of many typewriters, I was led through doors and passages, and at
length came upon the shrieking inferno of the shops. The uproar and din were maddening. Overhead,
huge cranes were swinging great bulks of steel from one end of the cavernous shed to the other;
vague figures were moving obscurely in the murk; the floor was piled and littered with heaps
of iron-work of unimaginable shapes. After a time we made our way into another area where there
was more quiet but no less confusion. I yelled to my guide, "Such a rumpus and row I never
saw; it is chaos come again!" And he replied, "Why, to me it is all a perfect order. Everything
is in its place. Every man has his special job and does it. I know the meaning and purpose
of all those parts that seem to you to be thrown around in such a mess. If you could follow
the course of making from the draughting-rooms to the finishing-shop, if you could see the
process at once as a whole, you would understand that it is all a complete harmony, every part
working with every other part to a definite end." It was not I but my friend who had the truth
of the matter. Where for me there was only chaos, for him was order. And the difference was
that he had the clue which I had not. His sense of the meaning of the parts brought the scattering
details into a final unity; and therein he found harmony and satisfaction.

I went away much impressed by what I had seen. When I had collected my wits a little in the
comparative calm of the streets, it occurred to me that the immense workshops were a symbol
of man's life in the world. In the instant of experience all seems chaos. At close range, in
direct contact with the facts and demands of every day, we feel how confusing and distracting
it all is. Life is beating in upon us at every point; all our senses are assailed at once.
Each new day brings its conflicting interests and obligations. Now, whether we are aware of
it or not, our constant effort is, out of the great variety of experience pressing in upon
us, to select such details as make to a definite purpose and end. Instinctively we grope toward
and attract to us that which is special and proper to our individual development. Our progress
is toward harmony. By the adjustment of new material to the shaping principle of our experience,
the circle of our individual lives widens its circumference. We are able to bring more and
more details into order, and correspondingly fuller and richer our life becomes.

The mental perception of order in the parts gives the whole its significance. This quick grasp
of the whole is like the click of the kaleidoscope which throws the tumbling, distorted bits
into a design. The conduct of practical life on the mental plane is the process also of art
on the plane of the emotions. Not only does experience offer itself to us as the subject of
thought; our contact with the world is also the stimulus of feeling. In my account of the visit
to the Locomotive Works I have set down but a part and not the sum of my reaction. After I
had come away, I fell to thinking about what I had seen, and intellectually I deduced certain
abstract principles with regard to unity and significance. But at the moment of experience
itself I simply felt. I was overwhelmed by the sense of unloosened power. The very confusion
of it all constituted the unity of impression. The emotion roused in me by the roar and riotous
movement and the vast gloom torn by fitful yellow gleams from opened furnaces and shapes of
glowing metal was the emotion appropriate to the experience of chaos. That I can find a single
word by which to characterize it, is evidence that the moment had its harmony for me and consequent
meaning. All the infinite universe external to us is everywhere and at every instant potentially
the stimulus to emotion. But unless feeling is discriminated, it passes unregarded. When the
emotion gathers itself into design, when the moment reveals within itself order and significance,
then and not till then the emotion becomes substance for expression in forms of art.

If I were able to phrase what I saw and what I felt in the Locomotive Works, so that by means
of presenting what I saw I might communicate to another what I felt and so rouse in him the
same emotion, I should be an artist. Whistler or Monet might picture for us the murk and mystery
of this pregnant gloom. Wagner might sound for us the tumultuous, weird emotions of this Niebelungen
workshop of the twentieth century. Dante or Milton might phrase this inferno and pandemonium
of modern industry and leave us stirred by the sense of power in the play of gigantic forces.
Whether the medium be the painter's color, the musician's tones, or the poet's words, the purpose
of the representation is fulfilled in so far as the work expresses the emotion which the artist
has felt in the presence of this spectacle. He, the artist, more than I or another, has thrilled
to its mystery, its tumult, its power. It is this effect, received as a unity of impression,
that he wants to communicate. This power of the object over him, and consequently the content
of his work, is beauty.

In the experience of us all there are objects and situations which can stir us,--the twilight
hour, a group of children at play, the spectacle of the great human crowd, it may be, or solitude
under the stars, the works of man as vast cities or cunningly contrived machines, or perhaps
it is the mighty, shifting panorama which nature unrolls for us at every instant of day and
night, her endless pageant of color and light and shade and form. Out of them at the moment
of our contact is unfolded a new significance; because of them life becomes for us larger,
deeper. This power possessed by objects to rouse in us an emotion which comes with the realization
of inner significance expressed in harmony is beauty. A brief analysis of the nature and action
of beauty may help us in the understanding and appreciation of art, though the value to us
of any explanation is to quicken us to a more vivid sensitiveness to the effect of beauty in
the domain of actual experience of it.

Because the world external to us, which manifests beauty, is received into consciousness by
the senses, it is natural to seek our explanation in the processes involved in the functioning
of our organism. Our existence as individual human beings is conditioned by our embodiment
in matter. Without senses, without nerves and a brain, we should not be. Our feelings, which
determine for us finally the value of experience, are the product of the excitement of our
physical organism responding to stimulation. The rudimentary and most general feelings are
pleasure and pain. All the complex and infinitely varied emotions that go to make up our conscious
life are modifications of these two elementary reactions. The feeling of pleasure results when
our organism "functions harmoniously with itself;" pain is the consequence of discord. Beauty,
then, according to the psychologists, is the quality inherent in things, the possession of
which enables them to stimulate our organism to harmonious functioning. And the perception
of beauty is a purely physiological reaction.

This explanation, valid within its limits, seems to me to fall short of the whole truth. For
it fails to reckon with that faculty and that entity within us whose existence we know but
cannot explain,--the faculty we call mind, which operates as imagination, and the entity we
recognize as spirit or soul. I mean the faculty which gives us the idea of God and the consciousness
of self, the faculty which apprehends relations and significance in material transcending their
material embodiment. I mean the entity within us which expresses itself in love and aspiration
and worship, the entity which is able to fuse with the harmony external to it in a larger unity.
When I glance out upon a winter twilight drenching earth and sky with luminous blue, a sudden
delight floods in upon me, gathering up all my senses in a surging billow of emotion, and my
being pulses and vibrates in a beat of joy. Something within me goes out to meet the landscape;
so far as I am at all conscious of the moment, I feel, There, that is what I am! This deep
harmony of tone and mass is the expression of a fuller self toward which I yearn. My being
thrills and dilates with the sensation of larger life. Then, after the joy has throbbed itself
out and my reaction takes shape as consciousness, I set myself to consider the sources and
the processes of my experience. I note that my eye has perceived color and form. My intellect,
as I summon it into action, tells me that I am looking upon a scene in nature composed of material
elements, as land and trees and water and atmosphere. My senses, operating through channels
of matter, receive, and my brain registers, impressions of material objects. But this analysis,
though defining the processes, does not quite explain my joy. I know that beyond all this,
transcending my material sense-perception and transcending the actual material of the landscape,
there is something in me and there is something in nature which meet and mingle and become
one. Above all embodiment in matter, there is a plane on which I feel my community with the
world external to me, recognizing that world to be an extension of my own personality, a plane
on which I can identify myself with the thing outside of me in so far as it is the expression
of what I am or may become. Between me and the external world there is a common term. The effect
which nature has upon us is determined, not by the object itself alone and not by our individual
mind and temperament alone, but by the meeting of the two, the community between the object
and the spirit of man. When we find nature significant and expressive, it is because we make
nature in some way a part of our own experience.

The material of an object is perceived by the senses. We see that it is blue or green or brown;
we may touch it and note that it is rough or smooth, hard or soft, warm or cold. But the expressiveness
of the object, its value for the emotions, does not stop with its merely material qualities,
but comes with our grasp of the "relations" which it embodies; and these relations, transmitted
through material by the senses, are apprehended by the mind. There are, of course, elementary
data of sense-perception, such as color and sound. It may be that I prefer red to yellow because
my eye is so constituted as to function harmoniously with a rate of vibration represented by
450 billions per second, and discordantly with a rate of vibration represented by 526 billions
per second. So also with tones of a given pitch. But though simple color and simple sound have
each the power to please the senses, yet in actual experience neither color nor sound is perceived
abstractly, apart from its embodiment in form. Color is felt as the property of some concrete
object, as the crimson of a rose, the dye of some fabric or garment, the blue of the sky, which,
though we know it to be the infinite extension of atmosphere and ether, we nevertheless conceive
as a dome, with curvature and the definite boundary of the horizon. Sound in and of itself
has pitch and timbre, qualities of pure sensation; but even with the perception of sound the
element of form enters in, for we hear it with a consciousness of its duration--long or short--or
of its relation to other sounds, heard or imagined.

Our perceptions, therefore, give us forms. Now form implies relation, the reference of one
part to the other parts in the composition of the whole. And relation carries with it the possibilities
of harmony or discord, of unity or disorder. Before an object can be regarded as beautiful
it must give out a unity of impression. This unity does not reside in the object itself, but
is effected by the mind which perceives it. In looking at a checkerboard I may see it as an
aggregation of white squares set off by black, or as black squares relieved by white. I may
read it as a series of horizontals, or of verticals, or of diagonals, according as I attend
to it. The design of the checker-board is not an absolute and fixed quantity inherent in the
object itself, but is capable of a various interpretation according to the relative emphasis
given to the parts by the perceiving mind. So with all objects in nature. The twilight landscape
which stirred me may have been quite without interest or meaning to the man at my side; or,
if he responded to it at all, his feelings may have been of a different order and quality than
mine. Where I felt a deep and intimate solemnity in the landscape, he might have received the
twilight as chill and forbidding.  Beauty, then, which consists in harmonious relation, does
not lie in nature objectively, but is constituted by the perception in man's constructive imagination
of a harmony and consequent significance drawn out of natural forms.  It is, in Emerson's phrase,
"the integrity of impression made by manifold natural objects." The mere pleasurable excitement
of the senses is hardly to be called beauty. An object to be beautiful must express a harmony
of relations and hence a meaning,--a meaning which goes beyond sense-perception and does not
stop with the intellect, but reaches the spirit. Psychologists tell us that "a curved line
is pleasing because the eye is so hung as best to move in it." Pleasing, yes; but not beautiful.
And precisely herein is illustrated the distinction. A life wearied with an undulating uniformity
of days will find beauty less in the curve than in the zigzag, because the sight of the broken
line brings to the spirit suggestions of change and adventure. A supine temper finds shock,
excitement, and a meaning in the vertical. Yet the significance of forms is not determined
necessarily by contrasts. A quiet spirit sees its own expression, a harmony of self with external
form, in the even lines and flat spaces of some Dutch etching. Or a vigorous, hardy mind takes
fresh stimulus and courage from the swirling clouds of Turner or the wind-torn landscapes of
Constable. An object is beautiful, not because of the physical ease with which the eye follows
its outlines, but in so far as it has the power to communicate to us the feeling of larger
life, to express and complete for us a harmony within our emotional experience.

Our senses report to us the material world; we see, we hear, we touch and taste and smell.
But we recognize also that nature has a value for the emotions; it can delight and thrill and
uplift, taking us out of ourselves and carrying us beyond the confines of the little circle
of our daily use and wont. As I look from my window I see against the sky a pear tree, radiant
with blossom, an explosion of light and sensation. Its green and white, steeped in sunshine
and quivering out of rain-washed depths of blue, are good to behold. But for me, as my spirit
goes out to meet it, the tree is spring! In this I do not mean to characterize a process of
intellectual deduction,--that as blossoms come in the spring, so the flowering of the tree
is evidence that spring is here. I mean that by its color and form, all its outward loveliness,
the tree communicates to me the spirit of the new birth of the year. In myself I feel and live
the spring. My joy in the tree, therefore, does not end with the sight of its gray trunk and
interwoven branches and its gleaming play of leaves: there my joy only begins, and it comes
to its fulfillment as I feel the life of the tree to be an expression and extension of the
life that is in me. My physical organism responds harmoniously in rhythm with the form of the
tree, and so far the tree is pleasing. But, finally, a form is beautiful because it is expressive.
"Beauty," said Millet, "does not consist merely in the shape or coloring of a face. It lies
in the general effect of the form, in suitable and appropriate action. . . . When I paint a
mother, I shall try and make her beautiful simply by the look she bends upon her child. Beauty
is expression." Beauty works its effect through significance, a significance which is not always
to be phrased in words, but is felt; conveyed by the senses, it at last reaches the emotions.
Where the spirit of man comes into harmony with a harmony external to it, there is beauty.

The elements of beauty are design, wholeness, and significance. Significance proceeds out of
wholeness or unity of impression; and unity is made possible by design. Whatever the flower
into which it may ultimately expand, beauty has its roots in fitness and utility; design in
this case is constituted by the adaptation of the means to the end. The owner of a saw-mill
wanted a support made for a shafting. Indicating a general idea of what he desired, he applied
to one of his workmen, a man of intelligence and skill in his craft, but without a conventional
education. The man constructed the support, a triangular framework contrived to receive the
shafting at the apex; where there was no stress within the triangle, he cut away the timber,
thus eliminating all surplusage of material. When the owner saw the finished product he said
to his workman, "Well, John, that is a really beautiful thing you have made there." And the
man replied, "I don't know anything about the beauty of it, but I know it's strong!" The end
to be reached was a support which should be strong. The strong support was felt to be beautiful,
for its lines and masses were apprehended as right. Had the man, with the "little learning"
that is dangerous, attempted embellishment or applied ornament, he would have spoiled the effect;
for ornateness would have been out of place. The perfect fitness of means to end, without defect
and without excess, constituted its beauty; and its beauty was perceived aesthetically, as
a quality inherent in the form, a quality which apart from the practical serviceableness of
the contrivance was capable of communicating pleasure. So in general, when the inherent needs
of the work give shape to the structure or contrivance, the resulting form is in so far forth
beautiful. The early "horseless carriages," in which a form intended for one use was grafted
upon a different purpose, were very ugly. Today the motor-car, evolved out of structural needs,
a thing complete in and for itself, has in its lines and coherence of composition certain elements
of beauty. In his "Song of Speed," Henley has demonstrated that the motorcar, mechanical, modern,
useful, may even be material for poetry. That the useful is not always perceived as beautiful
is due to the fact that the design which has shaped the work must be regarded apart from the
material serviceableness of the object itself. Beauty consists not in the actual material,
but in the unity of relations which the object embodies. We appreciate the art involved in
the making of the first lock and key only as we look beyond the merely practical usefulness
of the device and so apprehend the harmony of relations effected through its construction.
As the lock and key serve to fasten the door, they are useful; they are beautiful as they manifest
design and we feel their harmony. Beauty is removed from practical life, not because it is
unrelated to life,--just the reverse of that is true,--but because the enjoyment of beauty
is disinterested. The detachment involved in appreciation is a detachment from material. The
appreciator may seem to be a looker-on at life, in that he does not act but simply feels. But
his spirit is correspondingly alert. In the measure that he is released from servitude to material
he gives free play to his emotion.

Although beauty is founded upon design, design is not the whole of beauty. Not all objects
which exhibit equal integrity of design are equally beautiful. The beauty of a work of art
is determined by the degree of emotion which impelled its creation and by the degree in which
the work itself is able to communicate the emotion immediately. The feeling which entered into
the making of the first lock and key was simply the inventor's desire for such a device, his
desire being the feeling which accompanied his consciousness of his need. At the other extreme
is the emotion such as attended Michelangelo's vision of his "David" and urged his hand as
he set his chisel to the unshaped waiting block. And so all the way between. Many pictures
are executed in a wholly mechanical spirit, as so much manufacture; and they exhibit correspondingly
little beauty. Many useful things, as a candle-stick, a pair of andirons, a chair, are wrought
in the spirit of art; into them goes something of the maker's joy in his work; they become
the expression of his emotion: and they are so far beautiful. The moral value as such has very
little to do with it. It is a question of emotion. If Stuck were to put on canvas his idea
of peasants at prayer and if Millet had phrased in pictorial terms his feeling about war, there
is little doubt that Millet's painting would be the more telling and beautiful. The degree
of beauty is fixed by the depth of the man's insight into life and the corresponding intensity
of his emotion.

Beauty is not limited to one class of object or experience and excluded from another. A chair
may be beautiful, although turned to common use; a picture is not beautiful necessarily because
it is a picture. "Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad," says Whitman,
Whistler speaks of art as "seeking and finding the beautiful in all conditions and in all times,
as did her high priest, Rembrandt, when he saw picturesque grandeur and noble dignity in the
Jews' quarter of Amsterdam, and lamented not that its inhabitants were not Greeks." The beautiful
must exhibit an integrity of relations within itself, and it must be in integral relation with
its surroundings. The standard of beauty varies with every age, with every nation, indeed with
every individual. As beauty is not in the object itself, but is in the mind which integrates
the relations which the object manifests, so our appreciation of beauty is determined by our
individuality. And individuality is the resultant of many forces. The self, inexplicable in
essence, is the product of inheritance, and is modified by environment and training. More than
we realize, our judgment is qualified by tradition and habit and even fashion. Because men
have been familiar for so many centuries with the idea that sculpture should find its vehicle
in white marble, the knowledge that Greek marbles originally were painted comes with something
of a shock; and for the moment they have difficulty in persuading themselves that a Parthenon
frieze colored could possibly be beautiful. Until within comparatively recent years the French
have regarded Shakespeare as a barbarian. The heroic couplet, which was the last word in poetical
expression in the age of Queen Anne, we consider to-day as little more than a mechanical jingle.
Last year's fashions in dress, which seemed at the time to have their merits, are this year
amusingly grotesque. In our judgment of beauty, therefore, allowance must be made for standards
which merely are imposed upon us from without. It is necessary to distinguish between a formula
and the reality. As far as possible we should seek to come into "original relation" with the
universe, freshly for ourselves. So we must return upon our individual consciousness, and thus
determine what is vitally significant to us. For the man who would appreciate beauty, it is
not a question between this or that "school" in art, whether the truth lies with the classicists
or the romanticists; it is not a question of this or that subject or method to the exclusion
of all others. Beauty may be anywhere or everywhere. It is our task and joy to find it, wherever
it may be. And we shall find it, if we are able to recognize it and we hold ourselves responsive
to its multitudinous appeal.

The conception of beauty which limits its manifestation to one kind of experience is so far
false and leads to mischievous acceptances and narrowing rejections. We mistake the pretty
for the beautiful and so fail of the true value of beauty; we are blind to the significance
which all nature and all life, in the lowest and commonest as in the highest and rarest, hold
within them. "If beauty," says Hamerton, "were the only province of art, neither painters nor
etchers would find anything to occupy them in the foul stream that washes the London wharfs."
By beauty here is meant the merely agreeable. Pleasing the river may not be, to the ordinary
man; but for the poet and the painter, those to whom it is given to see with the inner eye,
the "foul stream" and its wharfs may be lighted with mysterious and tender beauty.

And Whistler, by the witchery of his brush and his needle, has transmuted the confusion and
sordidness and filth of this Thames-side into exquisite emotion. The essence of beauty is harmony,
but that harmony is not to be reduced to rule and measure. In the very chaos of the Locomotive
Works we may feel beauty; in the thrill which they communicate we receive access of power and
we are, more largely, more universally. The harmony which is beauty is that unity or integrity
of impression by force of which we are able to feel significance and the relation of the object
to our own experience. It is an error to suppose that beauty must be racked on a procrustean
bed of formula. Such false conceptions result in sham art. To create a work which shall be
beautiful it is not necessary to "smooth, inlay, and clip, and fit." Beauty is not imposed
upon material from without, according to a recipe; it is drawn out from within by the integrating
power of imagination. Art is not artificiality. Art is the expression of vital emotion and
essential significance. The beauty of architecture, for example, consists not in applied ornament
but in structural fitness and adaptability, and grows out of the inherent needs of the work.
The cathedral-builders of old time did not set themselves to create a "work of art." They wanted
a church; and it was a church they built. It is we who, perceiving the rightness of their achievement,
pronounce it to be beautiful. Beauty is not manufactured, but grows; it cannot be laid on as
ornament. Beauty is born out of the contact of the spirit of man with natural forms, that contact
which gives to objects their significance.

The recognition of the true nature of beauty may change for us the face of the world. Some
things are universally regarded as beautiful because their appeal is universal. There are passions,
joys, aspirations, common to all the race; and the forms which objectify these emotions are
beautiful universally. We can all enter into the feelings that gather about a group of children
dancing round a Maypole in the Park; but in the murk and din and demoniacal activity of the
Locomotive Works the appeal is not so obvious. The stupendous workshops become beautiful to
me as my being merges into harmony with them and dilates with the emotion of intenser and fuller
life. The Sistine Madonna is generally regarded as beautiful. But what is the beauty in the
unspeakable witch on the canvas of Frans Hals? Harmony of color and of composition is employed
by Raphael in the rendering of a figure and in the expression of an emotion both of which relate
themselves to the veneration of mankind. Maternity, Christian or pagan, divine or human, evokes
its universal tribute of feeling. On Raphael's canvas complete harmony is made visible; and
the beauty of the picture for us is measured by its power to stir us. In the painting by Frans
Hals the subject represented is in itself not pleasing. The technical execution of the picture
is masterly. But our delight goes beyond any enjoyment of the skill here exhibited, goes beyond
even the satisfaction of the senses in its color and composition. What the picture expresses
is not merely the visible aspect of this woman, but the painter's own sympathy and appreciation.
He saw a beauty in ugliness, a beauty to which we were blind, for he felt the significance
of her life, the eternal rightness to herself of what she was. His joy in this inner harmony
has transfigured the object and made it beautiful. Beauty penetrates deeper than grace and
comeliness; it is not confined to the pretty and agreeable. Indeed, beauty is not always immediately
pleasant, but is received often with pain. The emotion of pleasure, which is regarded as the
necessary concomitant of beauty, ensues as we are able to merge ourselves in the experience
and so come to feel its ultimate harmony. What is commonly accepted as ugly, as shocking or
sordid, becomes beautiful for us so soon as we apprehend its inner significance. Judged by
the canons of formal beauty, the sky-line of New York city, seen from the North River, is ugly
and distressing. But the responsive spirit, reaching ever outward into new forms of feeling,
can thrill at sight of those Titanic structures out-topping the Palisades themselves, thrusting
their squareness adventurously into the smoke-grayed air, and telling the triumph of man's
mind over the forces of nature in this fulfillment of the needs of irrepressible activity,
this expression of tremendous actuality and life. Not that the reaction is so definitely formulated
in the moment of experience; but this is something of what is felt. The discovery of such a
harmony is the entrance into fuller living. So it is that the boundaries of beauty enlarge
with the expansion of the individual spirit.

To extend the boundaries of beauty by the revelation of new harmonies is the function of art.
With the ordinary man, the plane of feeling, which is the basis of appreciation, is below the
plane of his attention as he moves through life from day to day. As a clock may be ticking
in the room quite unheeded, and then suddenly we hear it because our attention is called to
it; so only that emotion really counts to us as experience which comes to our cognizance. When
once the ordinary man is made aware of the underlying plane of feeling, the whole realm of
appreciation is opened to him by his recognition of the possibilities of beauty which life
may hold. Consciously to recognize that forces are operating which lie behind the surface aspect
of things is to open ourselves to the play of these forces. With persons in whom intellect
is dominant and the controlling power, the primary need is to understand; and for such, first
to know is to be helped finally to feel. To comprehend that there is a soul in every fact and
that within material objects reside meanings for the spirit, or beauty, is to be made more
sensitive to their influence. With the artist, however, the case is different. At the moment
of creation he is little conscious of the purport of the work to which he sets his hand. He
is not concerned, as we have been, with the "why" of beauty; from the concrete directly to
the concrete is his progress. Life comes to him not as thought but as emotion. He is moved
by actual immediate contact with the world about him,--by the sight of a landscape, by the
mood of an hour or place, by the power of some personality; it may be, too, a welter of recollected
sensations and impressions that plays upon his spirit. The resultant emotion, not reasoned
about but nevertheless directed to a definite end, takes shape in external concrete forms which
are works of art. Just because he is so quick to feel the emotional value of life he is an
artist; and much of his power as an artist derives from the concreteness of his emotion. The
artist is the creative mind, creative in this sense, that in the outward shows of things he
feels their inward and true relations, and by new combinations of material elements he reëmbodies
his feeling in forms whose message is addressed to the spirit. The reason why Millet painted
the "Sower" was that he felt the beauty of this peasant figure interpreted as significance
and life. And it is this significance and life, in which we are made to share, that his picture
is designed to express.

Experience comes to us in fragments; the surface of the world throws back to us but broken
glimpses. In the perspective of a lifetime the fragments flow together into order, and we dimly
see the purpose of our being here; in moments of illumination and deeper insight a glimpse
may disclose a sudden harmony, and the brief segment of nature's circle becomes beautiful.
For then is revealed the shaping principle. Within the fact, behind the surface, are apprehended
the relations of which the fact and the surface are the expression. The rhythm thus discovered
wakens an accordant rhythm in the spirit of man. The moment gives out its meaning as man and
nature merge together in the inclusive harmony. If the human spirit were infinite in comprehension,
we should receive all things as beautiful, for we should apprehend their rightness and their
harmony. To our finite perception, however, design is not always evident, for it is overlaid
and confounded with other elements which are not at the moment fused. Just here is the office
of art. For art presents a harmony liberated from all admixture of conflicting details and
purged of all accidents, thus rendering the single meaning salient. To compel disorder into
order and so reveal new beauty is the achievement of the artist. The world is commonplace or
fraught with divinest meanings, according as we see it so. To art we turn for revelation, knowing
that ideals of beauty may be many and that beauty may manifest itself in many forms.

VIII

THE ARTS OF FORM

THE maker of the first bowl moulds the plastic clay into the shape best adapted to its purpose,
a vessel to hold water, from which he can drink easily; the half-globe rather than the cube
affords the greatest holding capacity with the least expenditure of material. He finds now
that the form itself--over and above the practical serviceableness of the bowl--gives him pleasure.
With a pointed stick or bit of flint he traces in the yielding surface a flowing line or an
ordered series of dots or crosses, allowing free play to his fancy and invention. The design
does not resemble anything else, nor does it relate itself to any object external to the maker;
it has no meaning apart from the pleasure which it gave him as he conceived and traced it,
and the pleasure it now gives him to look at it. To another man who sees the bowl, its form
and its decoration afford likewise a double pleasure: there is first the satisfaction of senses
and mind in the contemplation of harmonious form and rhythmic pattern; and second, there is
communicated to him a feeling of the maker's delight in his handiwork, and sympathetically
and imaginatively the beholder realizes that delight in his own experience.

I am walking with a friend along a road which climbs a wooded hillside. A few steps bring us
to the top and the edge of a clearing. There, suddenly a sweep of country is rolled out before
us. A quick intake of the breath, and then the cry, "Ah!" Consciousness surges back over me,
and turning to my friend, I exclaim, "See the line of those hills over there across the tender
sky and those clouds tumbling above them; see how the hills dip down into the meadows; look
at the lovely group of willows along the bank of the river, how graciously they come in, and
then that wash of purple light over everything!" My simple cry, "Ah!" was the expression of
emotion, the unconscious, involuntary expression; it was not art. It did not formulate my emotion
definitely, and although it was an expression of emotion, it had no power to communicate the
special quality of it. So soon, however, as I composed the elements in the landscape, which
stimulated my emotion, into a distinct and coherent whole and by means of that I tried to convey
to my friend something of what I was feeling, my expression tended to become art. My medium
of expression happened to be words. If I had been alone and wanted to take home with me a record
of my impression of the landscape, a pencil-sketch of the little composition might have served
to indicate the sources of my feeling and to suggest its quality. Whether in words or in line
and mass, my work would be in a rudimentary form a work of representative art. The objective
fact of the landscape which I point out to my friend engages his interest; his pleasure derives
from those aspects of it which my emotion emphasizes and which constitute its beauty; and something
of the same emotion that I felt he realizes in his own experience.

The impulse to expression which fulfills itself in a work of art is directed in general by
one of two motives,--the motive of representation and the motive of pure form. These two motives
are coexistent with human activity itself. The earliest vestiges of prehistoric races and the
remains of the remotest civilizations are witnesses of man's desire to imitate and record,
and also of his pleasure in harmony of form. Certain caves in France, inhabited by man some
thousands of years before history begins, have yielded up reindeer horns and bones, carved
with reliefs and engraved with drawings of mammoths, reindeer, and fish. On the walls and roofs
of these caves are paintings in bright colors of animals, rendered with correctness and animation.
Flint axes of a still remoter epoch "are carved with great dexterity by means of small chips
flaked off the stone, and show a regularity of outline which testifies to the delight of primitive
man in symmetry."[*] Burial mounds, of unknown antiquity, and the rude stone monuments such
as Stonehenge and the dolmens of Brittany and Wales, emerging out of prehistoric dawns, are
evidence of man's striving after architectural unity in design and harmony of proportion.

[*] S. Reinach, The Story of Art throughout the Ages, chapter i.

The existence of these two separate motives which impel creation,
man's desire to imitate and his delight in harmony, gives rise to a
division of the arts into two general classes, namely, the
representative arts and the arts of pure form. The representative arts
comprise painting and sculpture, and literature in its manifestations
of the drama, fiction, and dramatic and descriptive poetry. These arts
draw their subjects from nature and human life, from the world
external to the artist. The arts of form comprise architecture and
music, and that limitless range of human activities in design and
pattern-making for embellishment--including also the whole
category of "useful arts"--which may be subsumed under the
comprehensive term decoration. In these arts the "subject" is
self-constituted and does not derive its significance from its likeness to
any object external to it; the form itself is the subject. Lyric poetry
stands midway between the two classes. It is the expression of
"inner states" but it externalizes itself in terms of the outer world. It
has a core of thought, and it employs images from nature which can
be visualized, and it recalls sounds whose echo can be wakened in
imaginative memory.
               Arise, arise!"

The intellectual and sensuous elements which lyric poetry embodies are finally submerged under
the waves of emotional stimulus which flow from the form as form. Such poetry does not depend
upon the fact of representation for its meaning; the very form itself, as in music, is its
medium of communicating the emotion. Art, therefore, to phrase the same matter in slightly
different terms, has a subjective and an objective aspect. In the one case, the artist projects
his feeling into the forms which he himself creates; in the other case, the forms external
to him, as nature and human life, inspire the emotion, and these external forms the artist
reproduces, with of course the necessary modifications, as the symbol and means of expression
of his emotion.

The distinction between the representative arts and the arts of form is not ultimate, nor does
it exclude one class wholly from the other; it defines a general tendency and serves to mark
certain differences in original motive and in the way in which the two kinds of work may be
received and appreciated. In actual works of art themselves, though they differ as to origin
and function, the line of division cannot be sharply drawn. The dance may be an art of form
or a representative art according as it embodies the rhythms of pure movement or as it numerically
figures forth dramatic ideas. Painting, as in the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel and the wall
paintings of Tintoretto and Veronese in the Ducal Palace of Venice, may be employed in the
service of decoration. Decoration, as in architectural sculpture and in patterns for carpets
and wall-coverings, often draws its motives from nature, such as leaves, flowers, fruits, and
animals; but when the function of the work is decorative and not representative, the naturalistic
and graphic character of the subject is subordinated to the purposes of abstract and formal
design. A picture, on the other hand, which is frankly representative in purpose, must submit
its composition and color-harmony to the requirements of unity in design; in a sense it must
make a pattern. And a statue, as the "Victory of Samothrace," bases its ultimate appeal, not
upon the fact of representation, but upon complete, rhythmic, beautiful form.

To the appreciator the arts of form carry a twofold significance. There is first the pleasure
which derives from the contemplation and reception of a harmony of pure form, including harmony
of color, of line, and of flat design as well as form in the round, a pleasure of the senses
and the mind. Second, works of art in this category, as they are the expression for the artist
of his emotion, become therefore the manifestation to the appreciator and means of communication
of that emotion.

Man's delight in order, in unity, in harmony, rhythm, and balance, is inborn. The possession
of these qualities by an object constitutes its form. Form, in the sense of unity and totality
of relations, is not to be confounded with mere regularity. It may assume all degrees of divergence
from geometric precision, all degrees of variety, ranging from the visual perfectness of the
Parthenon to the sublime and triumphant inconsequence of the sky-line of New York city. It
may manifest all degrees of complexity from a cup to a cathedral or from "Home, Sweet Home"
to Tschaikowski's "Pathetic Symphony." Whatever the elements and the incidents, our sense of
order in the parts and of singleness of impression endows the object with its form. The form
as we apprehend it of an object constitutes its beauty, its capability to arouse and to delight.

Because of the essential make-up of man's mind and spirit, powers that are innate and determined
by forces still beyond the scope of analysis, the perception of a harmony of relations, which
is beauty, is attended with pleasure, a pleasure that is felt and cannot be explained. This
inborn, inexplicable delight is at once the origin of the arts of form and the basis of our
appreciation. Each art, as the fashioning of objects of use, as decoration, architecture, and
music, is governed by its own intrinsic, inherent laws and rests its appeal upon man's pleasure
in form. There is no standard external to the laws of the art itself by which to judge the
rightness and the beauty of the individual work. In the arts of use and in decoration and architecture,
the beauty of a work, as the beauty of a chair, as in the ordering and appointments of a room,
as the beauty of a temple, a theatre, a dwelling, derives primarily from the fitness of the
object to its function, and finally from the rhythm of its lines and the harmony of its masses
and proportions,--its total form. A chair which cannot be sat in may be interesting and agreeable
to look at, but it is not truly beautiful; for then it is not a chair but a curiosity, a bijou,
and a superfluity; to be beautiful it must be first of all frankly and practically a chair.
A living-room which cannot be lived in with comfort and restfulness and peace of mind is not
a living-room, but a museum or a concentrated department store; at best it is only an inclosed
space. A beautiful building declares its function and use, satisfies us with the logic and
coherence of its parts, and delights us with its reticence or its boldness, its simplicity
or its inventiveness, in fine, its personality, as expressed in its parts and their confluence
into an ordered, self-contained, and self-sufficing whole. Music, using sound for its material,
is a pattern-weaving in tones. The power of music to satisfy and delight resides in the sensuous
value of its material and in the character of its pattern as form, the balance and contrast
of tonal relations, the folding and unfolding of themes, their development and progress to
the final compelling unity-in-variety which constitutes its form and which in its own inherent
and self-sufficing way is made the expression of the composer's emotion and musical idea. Lyric
poetry is the fitting of rhythmic, melodious, colored words to the emotion within, to the point
where the very form itself becomes the meaning, and the essence and mystery of the song are
in the singing. Beauty is harmony materialized; it is emotion ordered and made visible, audible,
tangible. If in the arts of form we seek further a standard of truth, their truth is not found
in their relation to any external verity, but is determined by their correspondence with inner
experience.

In the category of the arts of form the single work is to be received in its entirety and integrity
as form. The whole, however, may be resolved into its parts, and the individual details may
be interesting in themselves. Thus into decorative patterns are introduced elements of meaning
which attach themselves to the world and experience external to the artist. Many ornamental
motives, like the zigzag and the egg-and-dart, for example, had originally a symbolic value.
Sometimes they are drawn from primitive structures and fabrics, as the checker-board pattern,
with its likeness to the plaitings of rush mattings, and the volute and spiral ornaments, which
recall the curves and involutions of wattle and wicker work. Again, decoration may employ in
its service details that in themselves are genuinely representative art. The frieze of the
Parthenon shows in relief a procession of men and women and horses and chariots and animals.
The sculptures of Gothic churches represent men and women, and the carvings of mouldings, capitals,
and traceries are based on naturalistic motives, taking their designs from leaves and flowers.
The essential function of ornament is to emphasize form and not to obscure it, though nowadays
in machine-made things a kind of pseudo-embellishment is laid on to distract attention from
the badness and meaninglessness of the form; in true decoration the representative elements
are subordinated to the formal character of the whole. The representative interest may be enjoyed
separately and in detail; but finally the graphic purpose yields to the decorative, and the
details take their place as parts of the total design. Thus a Gothic cathedral conveys its
complete and true impression first and last as form. Midway we may set ourselves to a reading
of the details. The figure of this saint on the jamb or the archivolt of the portal is expressive
of such simple piety and enthusiasm! In this group on the tympanum what animation and spirit!
This moulding of leaves and blossoms is cut with such loving fidelity and exquisite feeling
for natural truth! But at the last the separate members fulfill their appointed office as they
reveal the supreme function of the living total form.

Music, too, in some of its manifestations, as in song, the opera, and programme music, has
a representative and illustrative character. In Chopin's "Funeral March" we hear the tolling
of church bells, and it is easy to visualize the slow, straggling file of mourners following
the bier; the composition here has a definite objective base drawn from external fact, and
the "idea" is not exclusively musical, but admits an infusion of pictorial and literary elements.
In listening to the love duet of the second act of "Tristan," although the lovers are before
us in actual presence on the stage, I find myself involuntarily closing my eyes, for the music
is so personal and so spiritualized, it is in and of itself so intensely the realization of
the emotion, that the objective presentment of it by the actors becomes unnecessary and is
almost an intrusion. The representative, figurative element in music may be an added interest,
but its appeal is intellectual; if as we hear the "Funeral March," we say to ourselves, This
is so and so, and, Here they do this or that, we are thinking rather than feeling. Music is
the immediate expression of emotion communicated immediately; and the composition will not
perfectly satisfy unless it is music, compelling all relations of melody, harmony, and rhythm
into a supreme and triumphant order.

Whereas the representative arts are based upon objective fact, drawing their "subjects" from
nature and life external to the artist; in decoration, in architecture, and in music the artist
creates his own forms as the projection of his emotion and the means of its expression. Richard
Wagner, referring to the composition of his "Tristan," writes: "Here, in perfect trustfulness,
I plunged into the inner depth of soul events, and from out this inmost centre of the world
I fearlessly built up its outer form. . . . Life and death, the whole import and existence
of the outer world, here hang on nothing but the inner movements of the soul. The whole affecting
Action comes about for the reason only that the inmost soul demands it, and steps to light
with the very shape foretokened in the inner shrine." The form, thus self-constituted, has
the power to delight us, and the work is at the same time the expression of emotion. The arts
of form please us with the pleasure that attends the perception of formal beauty; but this
pleasure docs not exhaust their capability to minister to us. What differentiates art from
manufacture is the element of personal expression. Born out of need, whether the need be physical
or spiritual, fulfilling the urge to expression, a work of art embodies its maker's delight
in creating. Correspondingly, beyond our immediate enjoyment of the work as form, we feel something
of what the man felt who was impelled to create it. His handiwork, his pattern, his composition,
becomes the means of communicating to us his emotional experience.

Obviously the significance of any work is determined primarily by the intensity and scope of
emotion which has prompted it. The creation of works of art involves all degrees of intention,
from the hut in the wilderness rudely thrown together, whose purpose was shelter, to a Gothic
cathedral, in its multitudinousness eloquent of man's worship and aspiration. The man who moulded
the first bowl, adapting its form as closely as possible to its use and shaping its proportions
for his own pleasure to satisfy his sense of harmony and rhythm, differs from the builders
of the Parthenon only in the degree of intensity of his inspiring emotion and in the measure
of his controlling thought. The beauty of accomplished form of cathedral and of temple is compelling;
and we may forget that they rose out of need. Both hut and bowl are immediately useful, and
their beauty is not so evident,--that little touch of feeling which wakens a response in us.
But in their adaptation to their function they become significant; the satisfaction which accompanies
expression is communicated to us as we apprehend in the work the creator's intention and we
realize in ourselves what the creation of it meant to him as the fulfillment of his need and
the utterance of his emotion.

So the expressive power of an individual work is conditioned originally by the amount of feeling
that enters into the making of it. Every phrase of a Beethoven symphony is saturated with emotion,
and the work leads us into depths and up to heights of universal experience, disclosing to
us tortuous ways and infinite vistas of the possibilities of human feeling. A simple earthen
jug may bear the impress of loving fingers, and the crudely turned form may be eloquent of
the caress of its maker. So we come to value even in the humblest objects of use this autographic
character, which is the gate of entrance into the experience of the men who fashioned them.
Every maker strives toward perfection, the completest realization of his ideal within his power
of execution. But the very shortcomings of his work are significant as expressive of what he
felt and was groping after; they are so significant that by a curious perversion, machinery,
which in our civilized day has supplanted the craftsman, tries by mechanical means to reproduce
the roughness and supposed imperfections of hand work. Music is the consummate art, in which
the form and the content are one and inextricable; its medium is the purest, least alloyed
means of expression of instant emotion. Architecture, in its harmonies and rhythms, the gathering
up of details into the balanced and perfect whole, partakes of the nature of music. But the
arts of use and decoration also have their message for the spirit. There is no object fashioned
by the hand of man so humble that it may not embody a true thought and a sincere delight. There
is no pattern or design so simple and so crude that it may not be the overflow of some human
spirit, a mind and heart touched to expression.

IX

REPRESENTATION

BEFORE me is a little bowl of old Satsuma. As I look at it there wakens in me a responsive
rhythm, and involuntarily my fingers move as if to caress its suave and lovely lines. The rich
gold and mingled mellow browns of its surface pattern intricately woven are a gracious harmony
and a delight. Gradually, as I continue to look on it, a feeling is communicated to me of the
maker's own joy in his work; and the bowl, its harmonies and rhythms, and all that it expresses,
become part of me. There it is, complete in itself, gathering up and containing within itself
the entire experience. My thoughts, sensations, feelings do not go beyond the bowl.

Another time I am standing in the hall of the Academy in Florence. At the end of the corridor
towers a superb form. I see that it is the figure of a youth. His left hand holds a sling drawn
across his shoulder; his right arm hangs by his side, his hand grasping a pebble close to his
thigh; calm and confident, his head erect, his strength held in leash waiting to be loosed,
he fronts the oncoming of the foe. The statue is the presentation of noble form, and it wakens
in me an accordant rhythm; I feel in myself something of what youthful courage, life, and conscious
power mean. But my experience does not stop there. The statue is not only presentation but
representation. It figures forth a youth, David, the Hebrew shepherd-boy, and he stands awaiting
the Philistine. I have read his story, I have my own mental image of him, and about his personality
cluster many thoughts. To what Michelangelo shows me I add what I already know. Recognition,
memory, knowledge, facts and ideas, a whole store of associations allied with my previous experience,
mingle with my instant emotion in its presence. The sculptor, unlike the potter, has not created
his own form; the subject of his work exists outside of him in nature. He uses the subject
for his own ends, but in his treatment of it he is bound by certain responsibilities to external
truth. His work as it stands is not completely self-contained, but is linked with the outer
world; and my appreciation of it is affected by this reference to extrinsic fact.

An artist is interested in some scene in nature or a personality or situation in human life;
it moves him. As the object external to him is the stimulus of his emotion and is associated
with it, so he uses the object as the symbol of his experience and means of expression of his
emotion. Here, then, the feeling, to express which the work is created, gathers about a subject,
which can be recognized intellectually, and the fact of the subject is received as in a measure
separate from the feeling which flows from it. In a painting of a landscape, we recognize as
the basis of the total experience the fact that it is a landscape, so much water and field
and sky; and then we yield ourselves to the beauty of the landscape, the emotion with which
the artist suffuses the material objects and so transfigures them. Into representative art,
therefore, there enters an element not shared by the arts of pure form, the element of the
subject, carrying with it considerations of objective truth and of likeness to external fact.
Toward the understanding of the total scope of a picture or a statue, and by inference and
application of the principles, toward the understanding of literature as well, it may help
us if we determine the relation of beauty to truth and the function and value of the subject
in representative art.

The final significance of a work of art is beauty, received as emotional experience. Nature
becomes beautiful to us at the point where it manifests a harmony to which we feel ourselves
attuned. At the moment of enjoyment we unconsciously project our personality into this harmony
outside of us, identifying ourselves with it and finding it at that instant the expression
of something toward which we reach and aspire. When we come consciously to reason about our
experience, we see that the harmony external to us which we feel as the extension of ourselves
does not stop with the actual material itself of nature, but emanates from it as the expression
of nature's spirit. The harmony is a harmony of relations, made visible through material, and
significant to us and beautiful in the measure that we respond to it.

It is the beauty of the object, its significance for the spirit, that primarily moves the artist
to expression. Why one landscape and not another impels him to render it upon his canvas is
not to be explained. This impulse to immediate and concrete utterance is inspiration. And inspiration
would seem to be a confluence of forces outside of the individual consciousness or will, focused
at the instant into desire, which becomes the urge to creation. The artist does not say, "Lo,
I will paint a landscape; let me find my subject!" The subject presents itself. There it is,
by chance almost,--a sudden harmony before him, long low meadows stretching away to the dark
hills, the late sun striking on the water, gold and green melting into a suffusing flush of
purple light, a harmony of color and line and mass which his spirit leaps out to meet and with
which it fuses in a larger unity. In the moment of contact all consciousness of self as a separate
individuality is lost. Out of the union of the two principles, the spirit of man and the beauty
of the object, is born the idea, which is to come to expression as a work of art.

But the artist is a mind as well as a temperament. Experience is a swing of the pendulum between
the momentary ecstasy of immediate contact and the subsequent reaction upon the moment, which
is consciousness of it. In order to make his vision actual, the artist rises out of the domain
of feeling into that of thought. The landscape has compelled him; it is now he who must compel
the landscape. To the shaping of his work he must bring to bear all his conscious power of
selection and organization and all his knowledge of the capabilities and resources of his means.
Art springs out of emotion; painting is a science. The artist's command of his subject as the
symbol of his idea derives from the stern and vigorous exercise of mind. The rightness of his
composition is determined by a logic more flexible, perhaps, but no less exacting than the
laws of geometry. By the flow of his line and the disposition of his masses, the artist must
carry the eye of the beholder along the way he wants it to travel until it rests upon the point
where he wants it to rest. There must be no leaks and no false directions; there must be the
cosmos within the frame and nothing outside of it. The principles of perspective have been
worked out with a precision that entitles them to rank as a science. Color has its laws, which,
again, science is able to formulate. These processes and formulas and laws are not the whole
of art, but they have their place. The power to feel, the imaginative vision, and creative
insight are not to be explained. But knowledge too, acquired learning and skill, plays its
part, and to recognize its function and service is to be helped to a fuller understanding of
the achievement of the artist.

Gifted with a vibrant, sensitive temperament, endowed with discriminating and organizing power
of mind, equipped with a knowledge of the science and the mechanics of his craft, and trained
to skill in manual execution, the artist responds to the impulse of his inspiration. His subject
is before him. But what is his subject? A scene in nature furnishes him the objective base
of his picture, but properly his work is the expression of what he feels. A storm may convey
to different men entirely different impressions. In its presence one man may feel himself overwhelmed
with terror. These wild, black skies piling in upon him, the hilltops that seem to race through
the clouds, the swaying, snapping trees, the earth caught up in the mad grasp of the tempest,
may smite his soul with the pitilessness of nature and her inexorable blind power. Another
thrills with joy in this cosmic struggle, the joy of conflict which he has known in his own
life, the meeting of equal forces in fair fight, where the issue is still doubtful and victory
will fall at last upon the strong, though it is not the final triumph but the present struggle
that makes the joy. In rendering the "subject" upon his canvas, by the manipulation of composition
and line and mass and color, he makes the storm ominous and terrible, or glorious, according
as he feels. The import of his picture is not the natural fact of the storm itself, but its
significance for the emotions.

A work of representative art is the rendering of a unity of impression and harmony of relations
which the artist has perceived and to which he has thrilled in the world external to him. He
presents not the facts themselves but their spirit, that something which endows the facts with
their significance and their power to stir him. As the meaning of nature to the beholder is
determined by the effect it produces on his mind and temperament, so the artist, in the expression
of this meaning, aims less at a statement of objective accuracy of exterior appearance than
at producing a certain effect, the effect which is the equivalent of the meaning of nature
to him. Thus the painter who sees beyond the merely intellectual and sensuous appeal of his
subject and enters into its spirit, tries to render on his canvas, not the actual color of
nature, but the sensation of color and its value for the emotions. With the material splendor
of nature,--her inexhaustible lavish wealth of color, the glory of life which throbs through
creation, the mystery of actual movement,--art cannot compete. For the hues and tones of nature,
infinite in number and subtlety, the painter has only the few notes within the poor gamut of
his palette. How can he quicken his dull paint with the life-beat of palpitating flesh, or
the sculptor animate the rigid marble with the vibrations of vivid motion? But where nature
is infinite in her range she is also scattering in her effects. By the concentration of divergent
forces, art gains in intensity and directness of impression what it sacrifices in the scope
of its material. Michelangelo uses as his subject David, the shepherd-boy; but the person,
the mere name, does not signify. What his work embodies is triumphant youth, made visible and
communicable. When Millet shows us the peasant, it is not what the peasant is feeling that
the artist represents, but what Millet felt about him. The same landscape will be rendered
differently by different men. Each selects his details according to the interest of his eye
and mind and feeling, and he brings them into a dominant harmony which stands to him for the
meaning of the landscape. None of the pictures is an accurate statement of the facts as they
are, off there in nature; all are true to the integrating inner vision. The superficial observer
sees only the accidents, and he does not distinguish relative importance. The artist, with
quicker sensibilities and a trained mind, analyzes, discovers the underlying principle, and
then makes a synthesis which embodies only the essential; he seizes the distinctive aspect
of the object and makes it salient. There may be, of course, purely descriptive representation,
which is a faithful record of the facts of appearance as the painter sees them, without any
feeling toward them; here he works as a scientist, not as an artist. Merely imitative painting
falls short of artistic significance, for it embodies no meaning beyond the external fact.
It is the expressiveness of the object that the true artist cares to represent; it is its expressiveness,
its value for the emotions, that constitutes its beauty.

To achieve beauty the representative artist bases his work upon the truth of nature. It is
nature that supplies him with his motive,--some glimpse, some fragment, which reveals within
itself a harmony. It may be a form, as a tree, a man, a mountain range, the race of clouds
across the sky; it may be a color-harmony or "arrangement," in which color rather than form
is the dominant interest, as with a landscape or an interior; it may be the effects of light,
as the sunshine playing over golden haystacks, or the glint of light on metal, or the sheen
of lovely fabrics. Out of the complex of interests and appeals which an object offers, what
is the truth of the object? The truth of nature resides not in the accidents of surface but
in the essential relations, of which the surface is the manifestation. A birch tree and an
apple tree are growing side by side. Their roots strike down into the same soil, their branches
are warmed by the same sun, wet by the same rains, and swept by the same winds. The birch tree
is always lithe and gracious and feminine; the apple tree is always bent and sternly gnarled
like the hand of an old man. The life-force which impels the tree to growth is distinctive
to each kind. Within all natural objects, then, a crystal, a tree, a man, there is a shaping
principle which determines their essential form. But no two individual apple trees are precisely
alike; from the essential form of the tree there are divergences in the single manifestations.
Though subject to accident and variation, however, every tree exhibits a characteristic, inviolate
tendency, and remains true to the inner life-principle of its being. The "truth" of the apple
tree is this distinctive, essential form, by virtue of which it is an apple tree and not some
other kind, the form which underlies and allows for all individual variations. What the painter
renders on his canvas is not the superficial accidents of some single tree, but by means of
that, he seeks to image forth in color and form the tendency of all trees. The truth of an
object presents itself to the imagination as design, for this organic, shaping principle of
things, expressed in colored myriad forms throughout the endless pageantry of nature, is apprehended
by the spirit of man as a harmony; and in the experience of the artist truth identifies itself
with beauty.

The distinction between the accidental surface of things and the significance that may be drawn
out of them is exemplified by the difference between accuracy and truth in representation.
Accurate drawing is the faithful record of the facts of appearance as offered to the eye. Truth
of drawing is the rendering in visible terms of the meaning and spirit of the object, the form
which the object takes not simply for the eye but for the mind. A pencil sketch by Millet shows
a man carrying in each hand a pail of water. The arms are drawn inaccurately, in that they
are made too long. What Millet wanted to express, however, was not the physical shape of the
arms, but the feeling of the burden under which the man was bending; and by lengthening the
arms he has succeeded in conveying, as mere accuracy could not express it, the sensation of
weight and muscular strain. In Hals' picture of the "Jester" the left hand is sketched in with
a few swift strokes of the brush. But so, it "keeps its place" in relation to the whole; and
it is more nearly right than if it had been made the centre of attention and had been drawn
with the most meticulous precision. The hand is not accurate, but it is true. Similarly, size
is an affair not of physical extent but of proportion. A figure six inches high may convey
the same value as a figure six feet high, if the same proportions are observed. A statue is
the presentation, not of the human body, but of the human form, and more than that, of what
the form expresses. When I am talking with my friend I am aware of his physical presence detaching
itself from the background of the room in which we are. But I feel in him something more. And
that something more goes behind the details of his physical aspect. His eyes might be blue
instead of brown, his nose crooked rather than straight; he might be maimed and disfigured
by some mishap. These accidents would not change for me what is the reality. My friend is not
his body, though it is by his body that he exists; the reality of my friend is what he essentially
is, what he is of the spirit. A photograph of a man registers certain facts of his appearance
at that moment. The eye and the mind of the artist discern the truth which underlies the surface;
the artist feels his sitter not as a face and a figure, a mere body, but as a personality;
and the portrait expresses a man.

As grasped by our finite minds, there are partial truths and degrees of truth. There are, for
example, the facts of outer appearance, modified in our reception of them by what we know as
distinct from what we really see. Thus a tree against the background of hill or sky seems to
have a greater projection and relief than is actually presented to the eye, because we know
the tree is round. Manet's "Girl with a Parrot," which appears to the ordinary man to be too
flat, is more true to reality than any portrait that "seems to come out of its frame." Habitually
in our observation of objects about us, we note only so much as serves our practical ends;
and this is the most superficial, least essential aspect. Projection is a partial truth, and
to it many painters sacrifice other and higher truths. Manet, recovering the "innocence of
the eye" and faithful to it, has penetrated the secrets and won the truth of light. Botticelli
saw the world as sonorous undulations of exquisite line; and his subtly implicated, evanescent
patterns of line movement, "incorrect" as they may be superficially in drawing, caress the
eye as music finds and satisfies the soul. When such is his power over us, it is difficult
to say that Botticelli had not some measure of the truth. The world of the Venetians sang full-sounding
harmonies of glorious color. Velasquez saw everything laved around with a flood of silver quiet
atmosphere. All in their own way have found and shown to us a truth.

To render what he has seen and felt in the essence and meaning of it, the artist seeks to disengage
the shaping principle of the particular aspect of truth, which has impressed him, from all
accidents in its manifestation. To make this dominant character salient beyond irrelevant circumstance,
art works by selection. Art is necessarily a compromise. It isolates some elements and sacrifices
others; but it is none the less true on that account. The mere material of the object is more
or less fixed, but the relations which the object embodies are capable of many combinations
and adjustments, according to the mind and temperament of the individual artist who is moved
by it. All art is in a certain sense abstraction; all art in a measure idealizes. It is abstraction
in the sense that it presents the intrinsic and distinctive qualities of things, purged of
accident.

Art does not compete with nature; it is a statement of the spirit and intention of nature in
the artist's own terms. The test of the work is not apparent and superficial likeness, but
truth. Art idealizes in the measure that it disengages the truth. In this aspect of it the
work is ideal as distinct from merely actual. There is a practice in art which draws its standard
of beauty, its ideal, not from nature but from other art, and which seeks to "improve nature"
by the combination of arbitrarily chosen elements and by the modification of natural truth
to fit a preconceived formula. The Eclectics of Bologna, in the seventeenth century, sought
to combine Raphael's perfection of drawing and composition, Michelangelo's sublimity and his
mastery of the figure, and Correggio's sweet sentiment and his supremacy in the rendering of
light and shade, fondly supposing thus that the sum of excellent parts is equivalent to an
excellence of the whole. This is false idealism. The Greeks carried their research for certain
truths of the human form to the point of perfection and complete realization. The truth of
the Greeks was mistaken by the pseudo-classicists and misapplied. Thus Delacroix exclaimed
ironically, "In order to present an ideal head of a negro, our teachers make him resemble as
far as possible the profile of Antinöus, and then say, 'We have done our utmost; if, nevertheless,
we fail to make the negro beautiful, then we ought not to introduce into our pictures such
a freak of nature, the squat nose and thick lips, which are so unendurable to the eyes.'" True
idealism treats everything after its own kind, making it more intensely itself than it is in
the play of nature; the athlete is more heroically an athlete, the negro more vividly a negro.
True idealism seeks to express the tendency by virtue of which an object is what it is. The
abstraction which art effects is not an unreality but a higher reality. It is not the mere
type, that art presents, for the type as such does not exist in nature. The individual is not
lost but affirmed by this reference to the inner principle of its being. A good portrait has
in it an element of caricature; the difference between portraiture and caricature is the difference
between emphasis and exaggeration. Art is not the falsification of nature, but the fuller realization
of it. It is the interpretation of nature's truth, the translation of it, divined by the artist,
into simpler terms to be read and understood by those of less original insight. The deeper
the penetration into the life-force and shaping principle of nature, the greater is the measure
of truth.

In representative art the truth of nature is the work's objective base. What the artist finally
expresses is the relation of the object to his own experience. A work of art is the statement
of the artist's insight into nature, moulded and suffused by the emotion attending his perception.
Of the object, he uses that aspect and that degree of truth which serve him for the expression
of his feeling toward it. What is called "realism" is one order of truth, one way of seeing.
"Impressionism" is another order of truth. "Idealism" is still another. But all three elements
blend in varying proportion in any work. Even the realist, who "paints what he sees," has his
ideal, which is the effect he sets himself to produce by his picture, and he paints according
to his impression. He renders not the object itself but his mental image of it; and that image
is the result of his way of seeing and feeling, his habit of mind, his interest, and his store
of memories. The idealist must base his work upon some kind of reality, or it is a monstrosity;
he is obliged to refer to the external world for his symbols. The impressionist, who concerns
himself with the play of light over surfaces in nature, is seeking for truth, and he cares
to paint at all because that play of light, seemingly so momentary and so merely sensuous,
has a value for his spirit of which he may or may not be wholly conscious; and these shifting
effects are the realization of his ideal. Unwitting at the moment of contact itself of the
significance that afterwards is to flow articulately from his work, the artist, in the presence
of his object, knows only that he is impelled to render it. As faithfully as possible he tries
to record what he sees, conscious simply that what he sees gives him delight. His vision wakens
his feeling, and then by reaction his feeling determines his vision, controlling and directing
his selection of the details of aspect. When Velasquez, engaged on a portrait of the king,
saw the maids of honor graciously attending on the little princess, he did not set about producing
a picture, as an end in itself. In the relation of these figures to one another and to the
background of the deep and high-vaulted chamber in which they were standing, each object and
plane of distance receiving its just amount of light and fusing in the unity of total impression,
were revealed to him the wonder and the mystery of nature's magic of light. This is what he
tried to render. His revelation of natural truth, wrung from nature's inmost latencies and
shown to us triumphantly, becomes a thing of beauty.

So the differences among the various "schools" in art are after all largely differences of
emphasis. The choice of subject or motive, the angle from which it is viewed, and the method
of handling, all are determined by the artist's kind of interest; and that interest results
from what the man is essentially by inheritance and individual character, and what he is moulded
into by environment, training, and experience. It may happen that the external object imposes
itself in its integrity upon the artist's mind and temperament, and he tries to express it,
colored inevitably by his feeling toward it, in all faithfulness to the feet as he sees it.
Millet said, "I should never paint anything that was not the result of an impression received
from the aspect of nature, whether in landscape or figures." Millet painted what he saw, but
he painted it as only he saw it. Or again it happens that an artist imposes his feeling upon
nature. Thus Burne-Jones said, "I mean by a picture a beautiful romantic dream of something
that never was, never will be--in a light better than any that ever shone--in a land no one
can define or remember, only desire." Whether true to nature or true to the creative inner
vision, the work of both men embodies truth. Sometimes an artist effaces entirely his own individuality,
as in Greek sculpture and Gothic architecture, and the mere name of the creator does not signify.
George Frederick Watts is reported to have said, "If I were asked to choose whether I would
like to do something good, as the world judges popular art, and receive personally great credit
for it, or, as an alternative, to produce something which should rank with the very best, taking
a place with the art of Pheidias or Titian, with the highest poetry and the most elevating
music, and remain unknown as the perpetrator of the work, I should choose the latter." Sidney
Lanier wrote, "It is of little consequence whether I fail; the I in the matter is small business.
. . . Let my name perish,--the poetry is good poetry and the music is good music, and beauty
dieth not, and the heart that needs it will find it." Or on the contrary, a work may bear dominantly,
even aggressively, the impress of the distinctive individuality of its creator, as with Carlyle's
prose and Browning's poetry. Whistler seems at times to delight less in the beauty of his subject
than in the exercise of his own power of refinement. Where another man's art is personal, as
with Velasquez or Frans Hals, Whistler's art becomes egotistical. He does not say, "Lo, how
mysterious is this dusk river-side, how tenderly serene this mother, how wistful and mighty
is this prophet-seer!" He exclaims rather, "Note how subtly I, Whistler, have seen. Rejoice
with me in my powers of vision and of execution." There is no single method of seeing, no one
formula of expression and handling. The truth both of nature and of art is great and infinitely
various. For art, like nature, is organic, allowing for endless modifications, while remaining
true to the inner principle of its being.

The judgment of truth is a delicate business. To test the truth of a work of art by reference
to the truth of nature is to presuppose that our power of perception is equal to the artist's
power, and that our knowledge of the object represented is equal to his knowledge of it. The
ordinary man's habitual contact with the world is practical, and his knowledge of natural fact,
based upon the most superficial aspect of it and used for practical purposes, tends to falsify
his vision. The artist's contact with the world, in his capacity as artist, is one of feeling;
he values life, not for its material rewards and satisfactions, but for what it brings to him
of emotional experience. The ordinary man uses nature for his own workaday ends. The artist
loves nature, and through his love he understands her. His knowledge of natural fact, instead
of falsifying his vision, reinforces it. He studies the workings of nature's laws as manifested
in concrete phenomena around him,--the movement of storms, the growth of trees, the effects
of light,--penetrating their inmost secrets, that he may make them more efficient instruments
of expression. He uses his understanding of anatomy, of earth-structure, of the laws of color,
as the means to a fuller and juster interpretation. As he receives the truth of nature with
reverence and joy, so he transmutes truth into beauty.

An artist's interest in the truth of nature is not the scientist's interest, an intellectual
concern with knowledge for the sake of knowledge. The artist receives nature's revelation of
herself with emotion. The deeper he penetrates into her hidden ways, the greater becomes her
power to stir him. The artist values his "subject," therefore, as the stimulus of emotion and
as the symbol by means of which he expresses his emotion and communicates it. The value of
the subject to the appreciator, however, is not immediately clear. It is not easy for us to
receive the subject purely as the artist shows it to us and independently of our own knowledge
of it. About it already gather innumerable associations, physical, practical, intellectual,
sentimental, and emotional, all of them or any of them, which result from our previous contact
with it in actual life. Here is a portrait of Carlyle. I cannot help regarding the picture
first of all from the point of view of its likeness to the original. This is a person with
whom I am acquainted, an individual, by name Carlyle. And my reaction on the picture is determined,
not by what the artist has to say about a great personality interpreted through the medium
of color and form, but by what I already know about Carlyle. Or here a painting shows me a
landscape with which I am familiar. Then instead of trying to discover in the picture what
the artist has seen in the landscape and felt in its presence, letting it speak to me in its
own language, I allow my thoughts to wander from the canvas, and I enjoy the landscape in terms
of my own knowledge and remembrance of it. The artist's work becomes simply a point of departure,
whereas it should be not only the beginning but also the end and fulfillment of the complete
experience. What is, then, we may ask, the relation of the fact of the subject to the beauty
and final message of the work?

The pleasure which attends the recognition of the subject is a legitimate element in our enjoyment
of art. But the work should yield a delight beyond our original delight in the subject as it
exists in nature. The significance of a work of representative art depends not upon the subject
in and of itself, but upon what the artist has to say about it. A rose may be made to reveal
the cosmos; a mountain range or cloud-swept spaces of the upper air may be niggled into meanness.
The ugly in practical life may be transfigured by the artist's touch into supreme beauty. "Il
faut pouvoir faire servir le trivial à l'expression du sublime, c'est la vraie force," said
one who was able to invest a humble figure with august dignity. Millet's peasants reveal more
of godlike majesty than all the array of personages in the pantheon of post-Raphaelite Italy
and the classic school of France. Upon his subject the artist bases that harmony of relations
which constitutes the beauty and significance of his work. Brought thus into a harmony, the
object represented is made more vivid, more intensely itself, than it is in nature, with the
result that we receive from the representation a heightened sense of reality and of extended
personality. The importance of the subject, therefore, is measured by the opportunity it affords
the artist, and with him his appreciators, to share in the beauty of nature and life. A picture
should not "standout" from its frame, but should go back into it, reaching even into infinity.
Our own associations attaching to the subject lose themselves as they blend with the artist's
revelation of the fuller beauty of his object; and finally all becomes merged in the emotional
experience.

Eliminating the transient and accidental, a work of art presents the essential and eternal.
Art appeals not to the intellect and the reason, but to the imagination and the emotions. The
single work, therefore, is concrete and immediate. But universal in its scope, it transcends
the particularities of limited place and individual name. We must distinguish between the abstractly
typical and the universal. The representative artist does not conceive an abstraction and then
seek to find a symbol for it. That is the method of allegory, where spring, for example, is
figured as a young woman scattering flowers. Allegory is decorative rather than representative
in intention. The artist receives his inspiration and stimulus from some actual concrete bit
of nature, a woodland wrapt in tender mists of green, a meadow gold and softly white with blossoms,
a shimmering gauze of sun touched air, moist and vibrating, enfolding it. That is what he paints.
But he paints it so that it is spring, and instinct with the spirit of all springs. Michelangelo
does not intellectually conceive youth and then carve a statue. Some boy has revealed to him
the beauty of his young strength, and the sculptor moves to immediate expression. He calls
his statue David, but the white form radiates the rhythm and glory of all youth. And as we
realize youth in ourselves, more poignantly, more abundantly, the mere name of the boy does
not matter. The fact that the portrait shows us Carlyle is an incident. Carlyle is the "subject"
of the picture, but its meaning is the twilight of a mighty, indomitable mind, made visible
and communicable. His work is done; the hour of quiet is given, and he finds rest. Into this
moment, eternal in its significance, into this mood, universal in its appeal, we enter, to
realize it in ourselves. The subject of picture or statue is but the means; the end is life.
Objective fact is transmuted into living truth. Art is the manifestation of a higher reality
than we alone have been able to know. It begins with the particular and then transcends it,
admitting us to share in the beauty of the world, the cosmic harmony of universal experience.

THE PERSONAL ESTIMATE

ART starts from life and in the end comes back to it. Art is born out of the stirring of the
artist's spirit in response to his need of expression, and it reaches its fulfillment in the
spirit of the appreciator as it answers his need of wider and deeper experience. Midway on
its course from spirit to spirit it traverses devious paths. The emotion out of which art springs
and of which it is the expression is controlled and directed by the shaping force of mind,
and it embodies itself in material form. This material form, by virtue of its qualities, has
the power to delight our senses; the skill which went into the fashioning of it, so far as
we can recognize the processes of execution, gives us pleasure; the harmony which the work
of art must manifest satisfies the mind and makes it possible for us to link the emotion with
our own experience.

These paths which a work of art traverses in its course from its origin to its fulfillment
I have tried to follow in their ramifications, and I have tried to trace them to their issue
in appreciation. Some lovers of art may linger on the way and rest content with the distance
they have come, without pressing forward to the end. A work of art is complex in its appeal;
and it is possible to stop with one or another of its elements. Thus we may receive the work
intellectually, recognizing its subject, and turning the artist's emotion into our thought
and translating it from his medium of color and form or sound into our own medium of words.
Here is a portrait of Carlyle; and Carlyle we know as an author and as a man. This landscape
is from the Palisades, where we have roamed in leisure hours. Before us is a statue of Zeus,
whom our classical reading has made a reality to us. This symphony gathers about a day in the
country, suggesting an incident in our own experience of which we have pleasant remembrances.
Intellectually, also, we enjoy the evidence of the artist's skill which the work exhibits.
Or we may pass beyond the simple exercise of the intellect, and with a refinement of perception
we may take a sensuous delight in the qualities of the material in which the work is embodied.
This portrait is a subtle harmony of color and exquisite adjustment of line and mass. The luminous
night which enwraps the Palisades is a solemn mighty chord. The white rhythm of this statue
caresses the eye that follows it. This symphony is an intricate and wonderful wave-pattern
upon a sea of billowing sound in which the listener immerses himself voluptuously. The essential
significance of a work of art is not to be received apart from its form, but the form is more
than merely sensuous in its appeal. Finally, therefore, the color and the composition of the
portrait are but the point of meeting where we touch in energizing contact a powerful personality.
Our spirit goes out into the night of these Palisades and dilates into immensity. This statue
is Olympian majesty made visible, and in its presence we feel that we too are august. The symphony
is a resolution of the struggle of our own tangled lives, a purification, and the experience
of joy.

Art is the expression of experience, whether the experience enacts itself within the spirit
of the artist or derives from his contact with the external world. So by the same token, art
is finally to be received as experience. The ultimate meaning of a work of art to the appreciator
is what it wakens in him of emotion. It is the artist's business, by the manipulation of his
materials and his elements, by the choice of motive and the rendering, by the note and pitch
of his color, the ordering of his line, the disposition of his masses, to compel the direction
of the emotion; he must not allow the solemnity and awe with which his night invests the Palisades
to be mistaken by the beholder for terror or for mere obscurity. But the quality and the intensity
of the emotion depend upon the temper of the appreciator's sensibilities and the depth and
range of his experience of life. Art is not fixed and invariable in its effect. "Vanity Fair"
is a great novel. One man may read it for the sake of the story, and in his amusement and interest
in following the succession of incident, he may for a while forget himself. A possible use
to put one's reading to; yet for that man the book is not art. Another may be entertained by
the spectacle of the persons as they exhibit themselves in Thackeray's pages, much as he might
stop a moment on the curbstone and watch a group of children at play in the street. Here he
is a looker-on, holding himself aloof; and for him, again, the book is not art. Still a third
may find in "Vanity Fair" a record of the customs and manners of English people at the beginning
of the nineteenth century; and he adds this much to his stock of information. Still for him
the book is not art. Not one of the three has touched in vital contact the essential meaning
of "Vanity Fair." But the man who sees in the incidents of the book a situation possible in
his own life, who identifies himself with the personages and acts out with them their adventures,
who feels that he actually knows Rawdon Crawley and Becky Sharp, Jo Sedley, Dobbin, and Amelia,
and understands their character and personality better here than in the actual world about
him by force of Thackeray's greater insight and power of portraiture, who sees in English manners
here represented the interpretation of his own surroundings, so that as a result of it all,
his own experience becomes richer for his having lived out the life of the fictitious persons,
his own acquaintances have revealed themselves more fully, his own life becomes more intelligible,--for
him at last the book is a work of art. So any work may be a mirror which simply reflects the
world as we know it; it may be a point of departure, from which tangentially we construct an
experience of our own: it is truly art only in the degree that it is revelation.

A work of art, therefore, is to be received by the individual appreciator as an added emotional
experience. It appeals to him at all because in some way it relates itself to his own life;
and its value to him is determined by the measure in which it carries him out into wider ranges
of feeling. There are works whose absolute greatness he recognizes but yet which do not happen
at the moment to find him. Constable comes to him as immensely satisfying; Turner, though an
object of great intellectual interest, leaves him cold. He knows Velasquez to be supreme among
painters, but he turns away to stand before Frans Hals, whose quick, sure strokes call such
very human beings into actuality and rouse his spirit to the fullest response. Why is it that
of two works of equal depth of insight into life, of equal scope of feeling, of the same excellence
of technical accomplishment, one has an appeal and a message for him and not the other? What
is the bridge of transition between the work and the spirit of the appreciator by which the
subtle connection is established?

It comes back to a matter of harmony. Experience presents itself to us in fragments; and in
so far as the parts are scattering and unrelated, it is not easy for us to guess the purpose
of our being here. But so soon as details, which by virtue of some selecting principle are
related to one another, gather themselves into a whole, chaos is resolved into order, and this
whole becomes significant, intelligible, and beautiful. Instinctively we are seeking, each
in his own way, to bring the fragments of experience into order; and that order stands to each
of us for what we are, for our individual personality, the self. We define thus our selecting
principle, by which we receive some incidents of experience as related to our development and
we reject others as not related to it. Thus the individual life achieves its integrity, its
unity and significance. This, too, is the process of art. A landscape in nature is capable
of a various, interpretation. By bringing its details into order and unity, the artist creates
its beauty. His perception of the harmony which his imagination compels out of the landscape
is attended with emotion, and the emotion flows outward to expression in a form which is itself
harmonious. This form is a work of art. Art, therefore, is the harmonizing of experience. Appreciation
is an act of fusion and identification. In spirit we become the thing presented by the work
of art and we merge with it in a larger unity. The individual harmony which a work of art manifests
becomes significant to us as we can make it an harmonious part of our own experience and as
it carries us in the direction of our development.

But how to determine, each man for himself, what is the direction of our development? A life
becomes significant to itself so soon as it is conscious of its purpose, and it becomes harmonious
as it makes all the details of experience subserve that purpose. The purpose of the individual
life, so far as we can guess it, seems to be that the life shall be as complete as possible,
that it shall fulfill itself and provide through its offspring for its continuance. It is true
that no life is isolated; as every atom throughout the universe is bound to every other atom
by subtlest filaments of influence, so each human life stands related to all other lives. But
the man best pays his debt of service to others who makes the most of that which is given him
to work with; and that is his own personality. We must begin at the centre and work outwards.
My concern is with my own justice. If I worry because my friend or another is not just, I not
only do not make him more just, but I also fail of the highest justice I can achieve, which
is my own. We must be true to ourselves. We help one another not by precept but by being; and
what we are communicates itself. As physical life propagates and thus continues itself, so
personality is transmitted in unconscious innumerable ways. The step and carriage of the body,
the glance of the eye, the work of our hands, our silences no less than our speech, all express
what we are. As everything follows upon what we are, so our responsibility is to be, to be
ourselves completely, perfectly.

A tender shoot pushes its way out of the soil into light and air, and with the years it grows
into a tree. The tree bears fruit, which contains the seed of new manifestations of itself.
The fruit falls to the ground and rots, providing thus the aliment for the seed out of which
other trees are to spring. From seed to seed the life of the tree is a cycle, without beginning
and without end. At no one point in the cycle can we say, Here is the purpose of the tree.
Incidentally the tree may minister to the needs and comfort and pleasure of man. The tree delights
him to look upon it; its branches shade him from the noonday sun; its trunk and limbs can be
hewn down and turned to heat and shelter; its fruit is good to eat. The primary purpose of
the fruit, however, is not to furnish food to man, but to provide the envelope for the transmission
of its seed and the continuance of its own life. Seen in its cosmic bearing and scope, the
purpose of the tree is to be a tree, as fit, as strong, as beautiful, as complete, as tree-like,
as it can be. The leaf precedes the flower and may be thought on that account to be inferior
to it in the scale of development. If a leaf pines and withers in regret that it is not a flower,
it not only does not become a flower, but it fails of being a good leaf. Everything in its
place and after its own kind. In so far as it is perfectly itself, a leaf, a blossom, a tree,
a man, does it contribute to the well-being of others. Man has subdued all things under his
feet and turned them to his own uses. By force of mind he is the strongest creature, but it
is not to be inferred that he is therefore the aim and end of all creation. Like everything
else, he has his place; like everything else he has the right to live his own life, triumphing
over the weaker and in his turn going down before a mightier when the mightier shall come;
like everything else he is but a part in the universal whole. Only a part; but as we recognize
our relation to other parts and through them our connection with the whole, our sense of the
value of the individual life becomes infinitely extended. We must get into the rhythm, keeping
step with the beat of the universal life and finding there our place, our destiny, the meaning
of our being here, and joy. The goods which men set before themselves as an end are but by-products
after all. If we pursue happiness we overtake it not. If we do what our hands find to do, devotedly
and with our might, then, some day, if we happen to stop and make question of it, we discover
that happiness is already there, in us, with us, and around us. The aim of a man's life in
the world, as it would seem, is to be perfectly a man, and his end is to fulfill himself; as
part of this fulfillment of himself, he provides for the continuance of his life in other lives,
and transmitting his character and influence, he enriches other lives because of what he is.
The purpose of seeing is that we may see more, and the eye is ever striving to increase its
power; the health of the eye is growth. The purpose of life is more life, individual in the
measure that it lies within a man's power to develop it, but cosmic in its sources and its
influence.

As the harmony which a work of art presents finds a place in that harmony of experience and
outward-reaching desire which constitutes our personality, art becomes for us an entrance into
more life. In the large, art is a means of development. But as any work embraces diverse elements
and is capable of a various appeal, it may be asked in what sense the appreciation of art is
related to education and culture. Before we can answer the question intelligently, we must
know what we mean by our terms. By many people education is regarded as they regard any material
possession, to be classed with fashionable clothes, a fine house, a carriage and pair, or touring-car,
or steam yacht, as the credential and card of entrée to what is called good society. Culture
is a kind of ornamental furniture, maintained to impress visitors. Of course we ourselves do
not think so, but we know people who do. Nor do we believe--as some believe--that education
is simply a means of gaining a more considerable livelihood. It is pathetic to see young men
in college struggling in desperate, uncomplaining sacrifice to obtain an education, and all
the while mistaking the end of their effort. Not all the deeds of daring in a university course
are enacted on the athletic field; the men I am thinking of do not have their pictures published
in the newspapers,--the unrecorded heroisms of college life are very moving to those who know.
But the tragedy I have in mind is this--for tragedy consists not in sacrifice itself but in
needless and futile sacrifice--that some of these young men suppose there is a magic virtue
in education for its own sake, that it is the open-sesame to all the wealth and beauty of life.
With insufficient ability to start with, they are preparing to be unfit professional men, when
they might be excellent artisans. The knowledge of books is in no sense the whole story nor
the only means of education. In devotion to some craft or in the intelligent conduct of some
business they might find the true education, which is the conscious discipline of one's powers.
The man who can do things, whether with his hands or with his brain, provided intelligence
govern the exercise of hand and brain, and who finds happiness in his work because it is the
expression of himself, is an educated man. The end of education is the building of personality,
the making of human power, and its fruit is wisdom.

Wisdom, however, does not consist in the most extensive knowledge of facts. Oftentimes information
overweights a man and snuffs out what personal force there might otherwise have been. On the
futility of mere learning there is abundant testimony. Walt Whitman, as we might expect from
his passion for the vital and the human, has said: "You must not know too much and be too precise
and scientific about birds and trees and flowers and watercraft. Even Ruskin, whose learning
was extensive and various, bears witness to the same effect. He notes "the diminution which
my knowledge of the Alps had made in my impression of them, and the way in which investigation
of strata and structure reduces all mountain sublimity to mere debris and wall-building." In
the same spirit he planned an essay on the Uses of Ignorance. From the midst of his labors
in Venice he wrote: "I am sure that people who work out subjects thoroughly are disagreeable
wretches. One only feels as one should when one doesn't know much about the matter." In other
words, we are not to let our knowledge come between us and our power to feel. In thus seeming
to assail education I am not seeking to subvert or destroy; I want simply to adjust the emphasis.
The really wise man is he who knows how to make life yield him its utmost of true satisfaction
and furnish him the largest scope for the use of his powers and the expression of himself.
In this sense a newsboy in the streets may be wiser than a university professor, in that one
may be the master of his life and the other may be the servant of his information. Education
should have for its end the training of capacities and powers, the discipline and control of
the intelligence, the quickening of the sympathies, the development of the ability to live.
No man is superior to his fellows because of the fact of his education. His education profits
him only in so far as it makes him more of a man, more responsive because his own emotions
have been more deeply stirred, more tolerant because his wider range has revealed more that
is good, more generous to give of his own life and service because he has more generously received.
It is not what we know nor what we have that marks our worth, but what we are. No man, however
fortunate and well-circumstanced he may be, can afford to thank God that he is not as other
men are. In so far as his education tends to withdraw him from life and from contact with his
fellows of whatever station, in so far as it fosters in him the consciousness of class, so
far it is an evil. Education should lead us not to judge lives different from our own, but
to try to understand and, to appreciate. The educated man, above all others, should thank God
that there are diversity of gifts and so many kinds of good.

Art is a means of culture, but art rightly understood and received. Art does not aim to teach.
It may teach incidentally, tangentially to its circle, but instruction, either intellectual
or ethical, is not its purpose. It fulfills itself in the spirit of the appreciator as it enables
him in its presence to become something that otherwise he had not been. It is not enough to
be told things; we must make trial of them and live them out in our own experience before they
become true for us. As appreciation is not knowledge but feeling, so we must live our art.
It is well to have near us some work that we want to be like. We get its fullest message only
as we identify ourselves with it. If we are willing to be thought ignorant and to live our
lives as seems good to us, I believe it is better to go the whole way with a few things that
can minister to us abundantly and so come to the end of them, than to touch in superficial
contact a great many lesser works. The lesser works have their place; and so far as they can
carry us beyond the point where we are, they can serve us. In a hurried touch-and-go, however,
there is danger of scattering; whereas true appreciation takes time, for it is less an act
than a whole attitude of mind. This is an age of handbooks and short cuts. But there is no
substitute for life. If for one reason or another the opportunity to realize art in terms of
life is not accorded us, it is better to accept the situation quite frankly and happily, and
not try to cheat ourselves with the semblance. But if it is indeed the reality, then we maybe
content with the minutes of experience, though we are denied the hours or the years. "The messages
of great poems," says Whitman, "to each man and woman are, Come to us on equal terms; only
then can you understand us." The power of response must be in us, and that power is the fruit
of experience. The only mystery of art is the mystery of all life itself. In nature the artist
finds the manifestation of a larger self toward which he aspires, and this is what his work
expresses. Alone with his spirit, he cries to us for that intimate mystic companionship which
is appreciation, and our response gives back the echo of his cry. He reaches out across the
distance to touch other and kindred spirits and draw them to himself. Says the poet,--

     "Thou reader throbbest life and pride and love the same as I,
     Therefore for thee the following chants."

We appreciate the artist's work as in it we live again and doubly.

Thus art links itself with life. The message of art to the individual defines itself according
to his individual needs. Life rises with each man, to him a new opportunity and a new destiny.
We create our own world; and life means to us what we are in ourselves. In art we are seeking
to find ourselves expressed more fully. The works that we care for, if we consider it a moment,
are the works we understand; and we understand them because they phrase for us our own experience.
Life and the truth of life are relative. Truth is not in the object but in our relation to
it. What is true for me may or may not be true for another. This much is true for me, namely,
whatever tallies with my experience and reveals to me more of the underlying purpose of the
universe. We are all, each in his own way, seeking the meaning of life; and that meaning is
special and personal to the individual, each man deciding for himself. By selection here, by
rejection there, we are trying to work toward harmony. The details of life become increasingly
complex with the years, but living grows simpler because we gradually fix a selecting and unifying
principle. When we have truly found ourselves, we come to feel that the external incidents
do not signify; which chance happens, whether this or that, is indifferent. It is the spirit
in which the life is lived that determines its quality and value. The perception of purpose
in the parts brings them into order and gives them meaning. A man's life is an expanding circle,
the circumference of which is drawn around an order or interplay and adjustment of part with
part. Whatever lies without the circle does not pertain to the individual--as yet. So soon
as any experience reveals its meaning to us and we feel that it takes its place in our life,
then it belongs to us. Whatever serves to bring details, before scattering and unrelated, into
order, is for that moment true. Art has a message for us as it tallies with what we already
know about life; and, quickening our perceptions, disclosing depths of feeling, it carries
us into new ranges of experience.

In this attitude toward life lies the justice of the personal estimate. The individual is finally
his own authority. To find truth we return upon our own consciousness, and we seek thus to
define our "original relation" to the universal order. So as one stands before the works of
the Italian painters and sculptors, for example, in the endeavor rightly to appreciate what
they have achieved, one may ask: How much of life has this artist to express to me, of life
as I know it or can know it? Has the painter through these forms, however crude or however
accomplished, uttered what he genuinely and for himself thought and felt? The measure of these
pictures for me is the degree of reality, of vital feeling, which they transmit. Whether it
be spring or divine maternity or the beauty of a pagan idea, which Botticelli renders, the
same power is there, the same sense of gracious life. Whether it be Credi's naïve womanhood,
or Titian's abounding, glorious women and calm and forceful men, or Delia Robbia's joyous children
and Donatello's sprites, the same great meaning is expressed, the same appreciation of the
goodness and beauty of all life. This beauty is for me, here, to-day. In the experience of
a man who thinks and feels, there is a time when his imagination turns toward the past. At
the moment, as the world closes in about him, his spirit, dulled by the attrition of daily
use and wont, is unable to discern the beauty and significance of the present life around him.
For a time his imagination finds abundant nourishment in the mighty past. Many spirits are
content there to remain. But life is of the present. To live greatly is to live now, inspired
by the past, corrected and encouraged by it, impelled by "forward-looking thoughts'" and providing
for the future, but living in to-day. Life is neither remembrance nor anticipation, neither
regret nor deferment, but present realization. Often one feels in a gallery that the people
are more significant than the pictures. Two lovers furtively holding hands and stopping before
a canvas to press closer together, shoulder to shoulder; a young girl erect and firm, conscious
of her young womanhood and rejoicing in it, radiating youth and life; an old man, whose years
are behind him yet whose interest reveals his eager welcome of new experience, unconsciously
rebuking the jaded and indifferent: here is reality. Before it the pictures seem to recede
and become dimmed. Our appreciation of these things makes the significance of it all. Only
in so far as art can communicate this sensation, this same impression of the beauty and present
reality of life, has it a meaning for us. The painter must have registered his appreciation
of immediate reality and must impart that to us until it becomes, heightened and intensified,
our own. The secret of successful living lies in compelling the details of our surroundings
to our own ends. Michelangelo lived his life; Leonardo lived his; neither could be the other.
A man must paint the life that he knows, the experience into which he enters. So we must live
our lives immediately and newly. We have penetrated the ultimate mystery of art when we realize
the inseparable oneness of art with life.

Art is a call to fuller living. Its real service is to increase our capacity for experience.
The pictures, the music, the books, which profit us are those which, when we have done with
them, make us feel that we have lived by just so much. Often we purchase experience with enthusiasm;
we become wise at the expense of our power to enjoy. What we need in relation to art is not
more knowledge but greater capability of feeling, not the acquisition of more facts but the
increased power to interpret facts and to apply them to life. In appreciation it is not what
we know about a work of art, it is not even what we actually see before us, that constitutes
its significance, but what in its presence we are able to feel. The paradox that nature imitates
art has in it this much of truth, that art is the revelation of the possibilities of life,
and we try to make these possibilities actual in our own experience. Art is not an escape from
life and a refuge; it is a challenge and reënforcement. Its action is not to make us less conscious
but more; in it we are not to lose ourselves but to find ourselves more truly and more fully.
Its effect is to help us to a larger and juster appreciation of the beauty and worth of nature
and of life.

Art is within the range of every man who holds himself open to its appeal. But art is not the
final thing. It is a means to an end; its end is personality. There are exalted moments in
the experience of us all which we feel to be finer than any art. Then we do not need to turn
to painting, music, literature, for our satisfaction. We are living. Art is aid and inspiration,
but its fulfillment and end is life.

"We live," says Wordsworth, "by admiration, hope, and love." Admiration is wonder and worship,
a sense of the mystery and the beauty of life as we know it now, and thankfulness for it, and
joy. Hope is the vision of things to be. And love is the supreme enfolding unity that makes
all one. Art is life at its best, but life is the greatest of the arts,--life harmonious, deep
in feeling, big in sympathy, the life that is appreciation, responsiveness, and love.
