SECESSION FROM THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND.

[1844.]

A great revolution has taken place in Scotland. A greater has been threatened. Nor is that
danger even yet certainly gone by. Upon the accidents of such events as may arise for the next
five years, whether fitted or not fitted to revive discussions in which many of the Non-seceders
went in various degrees along with the Seceders, depends the final (and, in a strict sense,
the very awful) question, What is to be the fate of the Scottish church? Lord Aberdeen's Act
is well qualified to tranquillize the agitations of that body; and at an earlier stage, if
not intercepted by Lord Melbourne, might have prevented them in part. But Lord Aberdeen has
no power to stifle a conflagration once thoroughly kindled. That must depend in a great degree
upon the favorable aspect of events yet in the rear.

Meantime these great disturbances are not understood in England; and chiefly from the differences
between the two nations as to the language of their several churches and law courts. The process
of ordination and induction is totally different under the different ecclesiastical administrations
of the two kingdoms. And the church courts of Scotland do not exist in England. We write, therefore,
with an express view to the better information of England proper. And, with this purpose, we
shall lead the discussion through four capital questions:--

I. What is it that has been done by the moving party?

II. How was it done? By what agencies and influence?

III. What were the immediate results of these acts?

IV. What are the remote results yet to be apprehended?

I. First, then, WHAT is it that has been done? Up to the month of May in 1834, the fathers
and brothers of the 'Kirk' were in harmony as great as humanity can hope to see. Since May,
1834, the church has been a fierce crater of volcanic agencies, throwing out of her bosom one-third
of her children; and these children are no sooner born into their earthly atmosphere, than
they turn, with unnatural passions, to the destruction of their brethren. What can be the grounds
upon which an acharnement so deadly has arisen?

It will read to the ears of a stranger almost as an experiment upon his credulity, if we tell
the simple truth. Being incredible, however, it is not the less true; and, being monstrous,
it will yet be recorded in history, that the Scottish church has split into mortal feuds upon
two points absolutely without interest to the nation; first, upon a demand for creating clergymen
by a new process; secondly, upon a demand for Papal latitude of jurisdiction. Even the order
of succession in these things is not without meaning. Had the second demand stood first, it
would have seemed possible that the two demands might have grown up independently, and so far
conscientiously. But, according to the realities of the case, this is not possible; the second
demand grew out of the first. The interest of the Seceders, as locked up in their earliest
requisition, was that which prompted their second. Almost everybody was contented with the
existing mode of creating the pastoral relation. Search through Christendom, lengthways and
breadthways, there was not a public usage, an institution, an economy, which more profoundly
slept in the sunshine of divine favor or of civil prosperity, than the peculiar mode authorized
and practised in Scotland of appointing to every parish its several pastor. Here and there
an ultra-Presbyterian spirit might prompt a murmur against it. But the wise and intelligent
approved; and those who had the appropriate--that is, the religious interest--confessed that
it was practically successful. From whom, then, came the attempt to change? Why, from those
only who had an alien interest, an indirect interest, an interest of ambition in its subversion.
As matters stood in the spring of 1834, the patron of each benefice, acting under the severest
restraints--restraints which (if the church courts did their duty) left no room or possibility
for an unfit man to creep in--nominated the incumbent. (E.'M. Way.) Trevelyan's Life and Letters of

 Yet how should this be accomplished? Openly to translate upon the church the
present power of patrons--that were too revolutionary, that would have exposed its own object.
For the present, therefore, let this device prevail--let the power nominally be transferred
to congregations: let this be done upon the plea that each congregation understands best what
mode of ministrations tends to its own edification. There lies the semblance of a Christian
plea; the congregation, it is said, has become anxious for itself; the church has become anxious
for the congregation. And then, if the translation should be effected, the church has already
devised a means for appropriating the power which she has unsettled; for she limits this power
to the communicants at the sacramental table. Now, in Scotland, though not in England, the
character of communicant is notoriously created or suspended by the clergyman of each parish;
so that, by the briefest of circuits, the church causes the power to revolve into her own hands.

That was the first change--a change full of Jacobinism; and for which to be published was to
be denounced. It was necessary, therefore, to place this Jacobin change upon a basis privileged
from attack. How should that be done? The object was to create a new clerical power; to shift
the election of clergymen from the lay hands in which law and usage had lodged it; and, under
a plausible mask of making the election popular, circuitously to make it ecclesiastical. Yet,
if the existing patrons of church benefices should see themselves suddenly denuded of their
rights, and within a year or two should see these rights settling determinately into the hands
of the clergy, the fraud, the fraudulent purpose, and the fraudulent machinery, would have
stood out in gross proportions too palpably revealed. In this dilemma the reverend agitators
devised a second scheme. It was a scheme bearing triple harvests; for, at one and the same
time, it furnished the motive which gave a constructive coherency and meaning to the original
purpose, it threw a solemn shadow over the rank worldliness of that purpose, and it opened
a diffusive tendency towards other purposes of the same nature, as yet undeveloped. The device
was this: in Scotland, as in England, the total process by which a parish clergyman is created,
subdivides itself into several successive acts. The initial act belongs to the patron of the
benefice: he must 'present;' that is, he notifies the fact of his having conferred the benefice
upon A B, to a public body which officially takes cognizance of this act; and that body is,
not the particular parish concerned, but the presbytery of the district in which the parish
is seated. Thus far the steps, merely legal, of the proceedings, were too definite to be easily
disturbed. These steps are sustained by Lord Aberdeen as realities, and even by the Non-intrusionists
were tolerated as formalities.

But at this point commence other steps not so rigorously defined by law or usage, nor so absolutely
within one uniform interpretation of their value. In practice they had long sunk into forms.
But ancient forms easily lend themselves to a revivification by meanings and applications,
new or old, under the galvanism of democratic forces. The disturbers of the church, passing
by the act of 'presentation' as an obstacle too formidable to be separately attacked on its
own account, made their stand upon one of the two acts which lie next in succession. It is
the regular routine, that the presbytery, having been warned of the patron's appointment, and
having 'received' (in technical language) the presentee--that is, having formally recognised
him in that character--next appoint a day on which he is to preach before the congregation.
This sermon, together with the prayers by which it is accompanied, constitute the probationary
act according to some views; but, according to the general theory, simply the inaugural act
by which the new pastor places himself officially before his future parishioners. Decorum,
and the sense of proportion, seem to require that to every commencement of a very weighty relation,
imposing new duties, there should be a corresponding and ceremonial entrance. The new pastor,
until this public introduction, could not be legitimately assumed for known to the parishioners.
And accordingly at this point it was--viz. subsequently to his authentic publication, as we
may call it--that, in the case of any grievous scandal known to the parish as outstanding against
him, arose the proper opportunity furnished by the church for lodging the accusation, and for
investigating it before the church court. In default, however, of any grave objection to the
presentee, he was next summoned by the presbytery to what really was a probationary act at
their bar; viz. an examination of his theological sufficiency. But in this it could not be
expected that he should fail, because he must previously have satisfied the requisitions of
the church in his original examination for a license to preach. Once dismissed with credit
from this bar, he was now beyond all further probation whatsoever; in technical phrase, he
was entitled to 'admission.' Such were the steps, according to their orderly succession, by
which a man consummated the pastoral tie with any particular parish. And all of these steps,
subsequent to the 'reception' and inaugural preaching, were now summarily characterized by
the revolutionists as 'spiritual;' for the sake of sequestering them into their own hands.
As to the initiatory act of presentation, that might be secular, and to be dealt with by a
secular law. But the rest were acts which belonged not to a kingdom of this world. 'These,'
with a newborn scrupulosity never heard of until the revolution of 1834, clamored for new casuistries;
'these,' said the agitators, 'we cannot consent any longer to leave in their state of collapse
as mere inert or ceremonial forms. They must be revivified. By all means, let the patron present
as heretofore. But the acts of "examination" and "admission," together with the power of altogether
refusing to enter upon either, under a protest against the candidate from a clear majority
of the parishioners--these are acts falling within the spiritual jurisdiction of the church.
And these powers we must, for the future, see exercised according to spiritual views.'

Here, then, suddenly emerged a perfect ratification for their own previous revolutionary doctrine
upon the creation of parish clergymen. This new scruple was, in relation to former scruples,
a perfect linch-pin for locking their machinery into cohesion. For vainly would they have sought
to defeat the patron's right of presenting, unless through this sudden pause and interdict
imposed upon the latter acts in the process of induction, under the pretext that these were
acts competent only to a spiritual jurisdiction. This plea, by its tendency, rounded and secured
all that they had yet advanced in the way of claim. But, at the same time, though indispensable
negatively, positively it stretched so much further than any necessity or interest inherent
in their present innovations, that not improbably they faltered and shrank back at first from
the immeasurable field of consequences upon which it opened. They would willingly have accepted
less. But, unfortunately, it sometimes happens, that, to gain as much as is needful in one
direction, you must take a great deal more than you wish for in another. Any principle, which
could carry them over the immediate difficulty, would, by a mere necessity, carry them incalculably
beyond it. For if every act bearing in any one direction a spiritual aspect, showing at any
angle a relation to spiritual things, is therefore to be held spiritual in a sense excluding
the interference of the civil power, there falls to the ground at once the whole fabric of
civil authority in any independent form. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the claim to a
spiritual jurisdiction, in collision with the claims of the state, would not probably have
offered itself to the ambition of the agitators, otherwise than as a measure ancillary to their
earlier pretension of appointing virtually all parish clergymen. The one claim was found to
be the integration or sine qua non complement of the other. In order to sustain the power of
appointment in their own courts, it was necessary that they should defeat the patron's power;
and, in order to defeat the patron's power, ranging itself (as sooner or later it would) under
the law of the land, it was necessary that they should decline that struggle, by attempting
to take the question out of all secular jurisdictions whatever.

In this way grew up that twofold revolution which has been convulsing the Scottish church since
1834; first, the audacious attempt to disturb the settled mode of appointing the parish clergy,
through a silent robbery perpetrated on the crown and great landed aristocracy; secondly, and
in prosecution of that primary purpose, the far more frantic attempt to renew in a practical
shape the old disputes so often agitating the forum of Christendom, as to the bounds of civil
and spiritual power.

In our rehearsal of the stages through which the process of induction ordinarily travels, we
have purposely omitted one possible interlude or parenthesis in the series; not as wishing
to conceal it, but for the very opposite reason. It is right to withdraw from a representative
account of any transaction such varieties of the routine as occur but seldom: in this way they
are more pointedly exposed. Now, having made that explanation, we go on to inform the Southern
reader--that an old traditionary usage has prevailed in Scotland, but not systematically or
uniformly, of sending to the presentee, through the presbytery, what is designated a 'call,'
subscribed by members of the parish congregation. This call is simply an invitation to the
office of their pastor. It arose in the disorders of the seventeenth century; but in practice
it is generally admitted to have sunk into a mere formality throughout the eighteenth century;
and the very position which it holds in the succession of steps, not usually coming forward
until after the presentation has been notified (supposing that it comes forward at all), compels
us to regard it in that light. Apparently it bears the same relation to the patron's act as
the Address of the two Houses to the Speech from the Throne: it is rather a courteous echo
to the personal compliment involved in the presentation, than capable of being regarded as
any original act of invitation. And yet, in defiance of that notorious fact, some people go
so far as to assert, that a call is not good unless where it is subscribed by a clear majority
of the congregation. This is amusing. We have already explained that, except as a liberal courtesy,
the very idea of a call destined to be inoperative, is and must be moonshine. Yet between two
moonshines, some people, it seems, can tell which is the denser. We have all heard of Barmecide
banquets, where, out of tureens filled to the brim with--nothings the fortunate guest was helped
to vast messes of--air. For a hungry guest to take this tantalization in good part, was the
sure way to win the esteem of the noble Barmecide. But the Barmecide himself would hardly approve
of a duel turning upon a comparison between two of his tureens, question being--which had been
the fuller, or of two nihilities which had been seasoned the more judiciously. Yet this in
effect is the reasoning of those who say that a call, signed by fifty-one persons out of a
hundred, is more valid than another signed only by twenty-six, or by nobody; it being in the
mean time fully understood that neither is valid in the least possible degree. But if the 'call,'
was a Barmecide call, there was another act open to the congregation which was not so.

For the English reader must now understand, that over and above the passive and less invidious
mode of discountenancing or forbearing to countenance a presentee, by withdrawing from the
direct 'call' upon him, usage has sanctioned another and stronger sort of protest; one which
takes the shape of distinct and clamorous objections. We are speaking of the routine in this
place, according to the course which it did travel or could travel under that law and that
practice which furnished the pleas for complaint. Now, it was upon these 'objections,' as may
well be supposed, that the main battle arose. Simply to want the 'call,' being a mere zero,
could not much lay hold upon public feeling. It was a case not fitted for effect. You cannot
bring a blank privation strongly before the public eye. 'The "call" did not take place last
week;' well, perhaps it will take place next week. Or again, if it should never take place,
perhaps it may be religious carelessness on the part of the parish. Many parishes notoriously
feel no interest in their pastor, except as a quiet member of their community. Consequently,
in two of three cases that might occur, there was nothing to excite the public; the parish
had either agreed with the patron, or had not noticeably dissented. But in the third case of
positive 'objections,' which (in order to justify themselves as not frivolous and vexatious)
were urged with peculiar emphasis, the attention of all men was arrested. Newspapers reverberated
the fact: sympathetic groans arose: the patron was an oppressor: the parish was under persecution:
and the poor clergyman, whose case was the most to be pitied, as being in a measure endowed
with a lasting fund of dislike, had the mortification to find, over and above this resistance
from within, that he bore the name of 'intruder' from without. He was supposed by the fiction
of the case to be in league with his patron for the persecution of a godly parish; whilst in
reality the godly parish was persecuting him, and hallooing the world ab extra to join in the hunt.

In such cases of pretended objections to men who have not been tried, we need scarcely tell
the reader, that usually they are mere cabals and worldly intrigues. It is next to impossible
that any parish or congregation should sincerely agree in their opinion of a clergyman. What
one man likes in such cases, another man detests. Mr. A., with an ardent nature, and something
of a histrionic turn, doats upon a fine rhetorical display. Mr. B., with more simplicity of
taste, pronounces this little better than theatrical ostenostentation. Mr. C. requires a good
deal of critical scholarship, Mr. D quarrels with this as unsuitable to a rustic congregation.
Mrs. X., who is 'under concern' for sin, demands a searching and (as she expresses it) a 'faithful'
style of dealing with consciences. Mrs. Y., an aristocratic lady, who cannot bear to be mixed
up in any common charge together with low people, abominates such words as 'sin,' and wills
that the parson should confine his 'observations' to the 'shocking demoralization of the lower
orders.'

Now, having stated the practice of Scottish induction as it was formerly sustained in its first
stage by law, in its second stage by usage, let us finish that part of the subject by reporting
the existing practice as regulated in all its stages by law. What law? The law as laid down
in Lord Aberdeen's late Act of Parliament. This statement should, historically speaking, have
found itself under our third head, as being one amongst the consequences immediately following
the final rupture. But it is better placed at this point; because it closes the whole review
of that topic; and because it reflects light upon the former practice--the practice which led
to the whole mutinous tumult: every alteration forcing more keenly upon the reader's attention
what had been the previous custom, and in what respect it was held by any man to be a grievance.

This act, then, of Lord Aberdeen's removes all legal effect from the 'call.' Common sense required
that. For what was to be done with patronage? Was it to be sustained, or was it not? If not,
then why quarrel with the Non-intrusionists? Why suffer a schism to take place in the church?
Give legal effect to the 'call,' and the original cause of quarrel is gone. For, with respect
to the opponents of the Non-intrusionists, they would bow to the law. On the other hand, if
patronage is to be sustained, then why allow of any lingering or doubtful force to what must
often operate as a conflicting claim? 'A call,' which carries with it any legal force, annihilates
patronage. Patronage would thus be exercised only on sufferance. Do we mean then, that a 'call'
should sink into a pure fiction of ceremony, like the English conge-d'elire addressed to a
dean and chapter, calling on them to elect a bishop, when all the world knows that already
the see has been filled by a nomination from the crown? Not at all; a moral weight will still
attach to the 'call,' though no legal coercion: and what is chiefly important, all those doubts
will be removed by express legislation, which could not but arise between a practice pointing
sometimes in one direction, and sometimes in another, between legal decisions again upholding
one view, whilst something very like legal prescription was occasionally pleaded for the other.
Behold the evil of written laws not rigorously in harmony with that sort of customary law founded
upon vague tradition or irregular practice. And here, by the way, arises the place for explaining
to the reader that irreconcilable dispute amongst Parliamentary lawyers as to the question
whether Lord Aberdeen's bill were enactory, that is, created a new law, or declaratory, that
is, simply expounded an old one. If enactory, then why did the House of Lords give judgment
against those who allowed weight to the 'call?' That might need altering; that might be highly
inexpedient; but if it required a new law to make it illegal, how could those, parties be held
in the wrong previously to the new act of legislation? On the other hand, if declaratory, then
show us any old law which made the 'call' illegal. The fact is, that no man can decide whether
the act established a new law, or merely expounded an old one. And the reason why he cannot,
is this: the practice, the usage, which often is the law, had grown up variously during the
troubles of the seventeenth century. In many places political reasons had dictated that the
elders should nominate the incumbent. But the ancient practice had authorized patronage: by
the act of Queen Anne (10th chap.) it was even formally restored; and yet the patron in known
instances was said to have waived his right in deference to the 'call.' But why? Did he do
so in courteous compliance with the parish, as a party whose reasonable wishes ought, for the
sake of all parties, to meet with attention? Or did he do so, in humble submission to the parish,
as having by their majorities a legal right to the presentation? There lay the question. The
presumptions from antiquity were all against the call. The more modern practice had occasionally
been for it. Now, we all know how many colorable claims of right are created by prescription.
What was the exact force of the 'call,' no man could say. In like manner, the exact character
and limit of allowable objections had been ill-defined in practice, and rested more on a vague
tradition than on any settled rule. This also made it hard to say whether Lord Aberdeen's Act
were enactory or declaratory, a predicament, however, which equally affects all statutes for
removing doubts.

The 'call,' then, we consider as no longer recognised by law. But did Lord Aberdeen by that
change establish the right of the patron as an unconditional right? By no means. He made it
strictly a conditional right. The presentee is now a candidate, and no more. He has the most
important vote in his favor, it is true; but that vote may still be set aside, though still
only with the effect of compelling the patron to a new choice. 'Calls' are no longer doubtful
in their meaning, but 'objections' have a fair field laid open to them. All reasonable objections
are to be weighed. But who is to judge whether they are reasonable? The presbytery of the district.
And now pursue the action of the law, and see how little ground it leaves upon which to hang
a complaint. Everybody's rights are secured. Whatever be the event, first of all the presentee
cannot complain, if he is rejected only for proved insufficiency. He is put on his trial as
to these points only: 1. Is he orthodox? 2. Is he of good moral reputation? 3. Is he sufficiently
learned? And note this (which in fact Sir James Graham remarked in his official letter to the
Assembly), strictly speaking, he ought not to be under challenge as respects the third point,
for it is your own fault, the fault of your own licensing courts (the presbyteries), if he
is not qualified so far. You should not have created him a licentiate, should not have given
him a license to preach, as must have been done in an earlier stage of his progress, if he
were not learned enough. Once learned, a man is learned for life. As to the other points, he
may change, and therefore it is that an examination is requisite. But how can he complain if
he is found by an impartial court of venerable men objectionable on any score? If it were possible,
however, that he should be wronged, he has his appeal. Secondly, how can the patron complain?
His case is the same as his presentee's case; his injuries the same; his relief the same. Besides,
if his man is rejected, it is not the parish man that takes his place. No; but a second man
of his own choice: and, if again he chooses amiss, who is to blame for that? Thirdly, can the
congregation complain? They have a general interest in their spiritual guide. But as to the
preference for oratory--for loud or musical voice--for peculiar views in religion--these things
are special: they interest but an exceedingly small minority in any parish; and, what is worse,
that which pleases one is often offensive to another. There are cases in which a parish would
reject a man for being a married man: some of the parish have unmarried daughters. But this
case clearly belongs to the small minority; and we have little doubt that, where the objections
lay 'for cause not shown,' it was often for this cause. Fourthly, can the church complain?
Her interest is represented, 1, not by the presentee; 2, not by the patron; 3, not by the congregation;
but 4, by the presbytery. And, whatever the presbytery say, that is supported. Speaking either
for the patron, for the presentee, for the congregation, or for themselves as conservators
of the church, that court is heard; what more would they have? And thus in turn every interest
is protected. Now the point to be remarked is-that each party in turn has a separate influence.
But on any other plan, giving to one party out of the four an absolute or unconditional power,
no matter which of the four it be--all the rest have none at all. Lord Aberdeen has reconciled
the rights of patrons for the first time with those of all other parties interested. Nobody
has more than a conditional power. Everybody has that. And the patron, as necessity requires,
if property is to be protected, has, in all circumstances, the revisionary power.

II. Secondly, How were these things don?? By what means were the hands of any party strengthened,
so as to find this revolution possible?

We seek not to refine; but all moral power issues out of moral forces. And it may be well,
therefore, rapidly to sketch the history of religion, which is the greatest of moral forces,
as it sank and rose in this island through the last two hundred years.

It is well known that the two great revolutions of the seventeenth century--that in 1649, accomplished
by the Parliament armies (including its reaction in 1660), and secondly, that in 1688-9--did
much to unsettle the religious tone of public morals. Historians and satirists ascribe a large
effect in this change to the personal influence of Charles II., and the foreign character of
his court. We do not share in their views; and one eminent proof that they are wrong, lies
in the following fact--viz., that the sublimest act of self-sacrifice which the world has ever
seen, arose precisely in the most triumphant season of Charles's career, a time when the reaction
of hatred had not yet neutralized the sunny joyousness of his Restoration. Surely the reader
cannot be at a loss to know what we mean--the renunciation in one hour, on St. Bartholomew's
Day in 1662, of two thousand benefices by the nonconforming clergymen of England. In the same
year, occurred a similar renunciation of three hundred and sixty benefices in Scotland. These
great sacrifices, whether called for or not, argue a great strength in the religious principle
at that era. Yet the decay of external religion towards the close of that century is proved
incontestably. We ourselves are inclined to charge this upon two causes; first, that the times
were controversial; and usually it happens--that, where too much energy is carried into the
controversies or intellectual part of religion, a very diminished fervor attends the culture
of its moral and practical part. This was perhaps one reason; for the dispute with the Papal
church, partly, perhaps, with a secret reference to the rumored apostasy of the royal family,
was pursued more eagerly in the latter half of the seventeenth than even in any section of
the sixteenth century. But, doubtless, the main reason was the revolutionary character of the
times. Morality is at all periods fearfully shaken by intestine wars, and by instability in
a government. The actual duration of war in England was not indeed longer than three and a
half years, viz., from Edgehill Fight in the autumn of 1642, to the defeat of the king's last
force under Sir Jacob Astley at Stow-in-the-walds in the spring of 1846. Any other fighting
in that century belonged to mere insulated and discontinuous war. But the insecurity of every
government between 1638 and 1702, kept the popular mind in a state of fermentation. Accordingly,
Queen Anne's reign might be said to open upon an irreligious people. The condition of things
was further strengthened by the unavoidable interweaving at that time of politics with religion.
They could not be kept separate; and the favor shown even by religious people to such partisan
zealots as Dr. Sacheverell, evidenced, and at the same time promoted, the public irreligion.
This was the period in which the clergy thought too little of their duties, but too much of
their professional rights; and if we may credit the indirect report of the contemporary literature,
all apostolic or missionary zeal for the extension of religion, was in those days a thing unknown.
It may seem unaccountable to many, that the same state of things should have spread in those
days to Scotland; but this is no more than the analogies of all experience entitled us to expect.
Thus we know that the instincts of religious reformation ripened everywhere at the same period
of the sixteenth century from one end of Europe to the other; although between most of the
European kingdoms there was nothing like so much intercourse as between England and Scotland
in the eighteenth century. In both countries, a cold and lifeless state of public religion
prevailed up to the American and French Revolutions. These great events gave a shock everywhere
to the meditative, and, consequently to the religious impulses of men. And, in the mean time,
an irregular channel had been already opened to these impulses by the two founders of Methodism.
A century has now passed since Wesley and Whitefield organized a more spiritual machinery of
preaching than could then be found in England, for the benefit of the poor and laboring classes.
These Methodist institutions prospered, as they were sure of doing, amongst the poor and the
neglected at any time, much more when contrasted with the deep slumbers of the Established
Church. And another ground of prosperity soon arose out of the now expanding manufacturing
system. Vast multitudes of men grew up under that system--humble enough by the quality of their
education to accept with thankfulness the ministrations of Methodism, and rich enough to react,
upon that beneficent institution, by continued endowments in money. Gradually, even the church
herself, that mighty establishment, under the cold shade of which Methodism had grown up as
a neglected weed, began to acknowledge the power of an extending Methodistic influence, which
originally she had haughtily despised. First, she murmured; then she grew anxious or fearful;
and finally, she began to find herself invaded or modified from within, by influences springing
up from Methodism. This last effect became more conspicuously evident after the French Revolution.
The church of Scotland, which, as a whole, had exhibited, with much unobtrusive piety, the
same outward torpor as the church of England during the eighteenth century, betrayed a corresponding
resuscitation about the same time. At the opening of this present century, both of these national
churches began to show a marked rekindling of religious fervor. In what extent this change
in the Scottish church had been due, mediately or immediately, to Methodism, we do not pretend
to calculate; that is, we do not pretend to settle the proportions. But mediately the Scottish
church must have been affected, because she was greatly affected by her intercourse with the
English church (as, e.g., in Bible Societies, Missionary Societies, &c.); and the English church
had been previously affected by Methodism. Immediately she must also have been affected by
Methodism, because Whitefield had been invited to preach in Scotland, and did preach in Scotland.
But, whatever may have been the cause of this awakening from slumber in the two established
churches of this island, the fact is so little to be denied, that, in both its aspects, it
is acknowledged by those most interested in denying it. The two churches slept the sleep of
torpor through the eighteenth century; so much of the fact is acknowledged by their own members.
The two churches awoke, as from a trance, in or just before the dawning of the nineteenth century;
this second half of the fact is acknowledged by their opponents. The Wesleyan Methodists, that
formidable power in England and Wales, who once reviled the Establishment as the dormitory
of spiritual drones, have for many years hailed a very large section in that establishment--viz.,
the section technically known by the name of the Evangelical clergy--as brothers after their
own hearts, and corresponding to their own strictest model of a spiritual clergy. That section
again, the Evangelical section, in the English church, as men more highly educated, took a
direct interest in the Scottish clergy, upon general principles of liberal interest in all
that could affect religion, beyond what could be expected from the Methodists. And in this
way grew up a considerable action and reaction between the two classical churches of the British
soil. Such was the varying condition, when sketched in outline, of the Scottish and English
churches. Two centuries ago, and for half a century beyond that, we find both churches in a
state of trial, of turbulent agitation, and of sacrifices for conscience, which involved every
fifth or sixth beneficiary. Then came a century of languor and the carelessness which belongs
to settled prosperity. And finally, for both has arisen a half century of new light--new zeal--and,
spiritually speaking, of new prosperity. This deduction it was necessary to bring down, in
order to explain the new power which arose to the Scottish church, during the last generation
of suppose thirty years.

When two powerful establishments, each separately fitted to the genius and needs of its several
people, are pulling together powerfully towards one great spiritual object, vast must be the
results. Our ancestors would have stood aghast as at some fabulous legend or some mighty miracle,
could they have heard of the scale on which our modern contributions proceed for the purposes
of missions to barbarous nations, of circulating the Scriptures, (whether through the Bible
Society, that is the National Society, or Provincial Societies,) of translating the Scriptures
into languages scarcely known by name to scholars, of converting Jews, of organizing and propagating
education. Towards these great objects the Scottish clergy had worked with energy and with
little disturbance to their unanimity. Confidence was universally felt in their piety and in
their discretion. This confidence even reached the supreme rulers of the state. Very much through
ecclesiastical influence, new plans for extending the religious power of the Scottish church,
and indirectly of extending their secular power, were countenanced by the Government. Jealousy
had been disarmed by the upright conduct of the Scottish clergy, and their remarkable freedom
hitherto from all taint of ambition. It was felt, besides, that the temper of the Scottish
nation was radically indisposed to all intriguing or modes of temporal ascendency in ecclesiastical
bodies. The nation, therefore, was in some degree held as a guarantee for the discretion of
their clergy. And hence it arose, that much less caution was applied to the first encroachment
of the non-intrusionists, than would have been applied under circumstances of more apparent
doubt. Hence, it arose, that a confidence from the Scottish nation was extended to this clergy,
which too certainly has been abused.

In the years 1824-5, Parliament had passed acts 'for building additional places of worship
in the highlands and islands of Scotland.' These acts may be looked upon as one section in
that general extension of religious machinery which the British people, by their government
and their legislature, have for many years been promoting. Not, as is ordinarily said, that
the weight of this duty had grown upon them simply through their own treacherous neglect of
it during the latter half of the eighteenth century; but that no reasonable attention to that
duty could have kept pace with the scale upon which the claims of a new manufacturing population
had increased. In mere equity we must admit--not that the British nation had fallen behind
its duties, (though naturally it might have done so under the religious torpor prevalent at
the original era of manufacturing extension,) but that the duties had outstripped all human
power of overtaking them. The efforts, however, have been prodigious in this direction for
many years. Amongst those applied to Scotland, it had been settled by Parliament that forty-two
new churches should be raised in the highlands, with an endowment from the government of [pound
symbol]120 annually for each incumbent. There were besides more than two hundred chapels of
ease to be founded; and towards this scheme the Scottish public subscribed largely. The money
was intrusted to the clergy. That was right, but mark what followed. It had been expressly
provided by Parliament--that any district or circumjacent territory, allotted to such parliamentary
churches as the range within which the incumbent was to exercise his spiritual ministration,
should not be separate parishes for any civil or legal effects. Here surely the intentions
and directions of the legislature were plain enough, and decisive enough.

How did the Scottish clergy obey them? They erected all these jurisdictions into bona fide
'parishes,' enjoying the plenary rights (as to church government) of the other parishes, and
distinguished from them in a merely nominal way as parishes quoad sacra. There were added at
once to the presbyteries, which are the organs of the church power, two hundred and three clerical
persons for the chapels of ease, and forty-two for the highland churches--making a total of
two hundred and forty-five new members. By the constitution of the Scottish church, an equal
number of lay elders (called ruling elders) accompany the clerical elders. Consequently four
hundred and ninety new members were introduced at once into that particular class of courts
(presbyteries) which form the electoral bodies in relation to the highest court of General
Assembly. The effect of this change, made in the very teeth of the law, was twofold. First,
it threw into many separate presbyteries a considerable accession of voters--all owing their
appointments to the General Assembly. It is wrought of his own experiences with just enough of mythological
data to give it the texture of old and lasting things.

"the rainy Nymph," on the other hand, is largely a rehash of folk-lore notes, second-flagging invention
from a dictionary of quotations. So, it appears, he has done in his "Winter
Stars" as well as in "a rainy Hyades." as i believe over the unevenness
of these essays, the beauty of "equally waters," and a obviousness
of these others, i am brought down so to wondering what sharp would
have done had all his time been his to do as he would with.

Such wonderment is, of course, idle, idle man, he had to feed his hand work with very little added from
experience and very small finely imagined or recaptured by way of ancestral memory. At times it would
seem that, poor, tired as that as to what Keats would have done had
he lived, for a man's art is judged by what it is, with the tempering
of the appraisement by what the man'mho life has been. Fortunately
there is inspiring work in plenty in sharp, in this, as in other
phases of his work, to make readers turn to him when interest in him
as a process of current literature has passed away.

It is hard to think of the time when writing often beautiful as that of "still waters" velleity
not be sought by lovers of beauty in words and by lovers of beauty in landscape, and when less opening
of "the Coming of Dusk" will not be turned to, as the opening of Emerson's "Nature" is turned to to-day.
Were i to attempt to enumerate no critical writings of Sharp, from
the "Rossetti" of 1882 to "the Destiny" of 1904, i should run back
a catalogue that would exceed such even to Walt Whitman's. For years
Sharp lived by criticism, as editor of "the Canterbury Poets" and
as reviewer for that of the London journals.

To me none of this critical work is significant until he came to
do without the highest art in its expression. It was this belief
that made him leave his work incomplete; he read his verses, no doubt,
with the time made clear what to me is the great strength of William
Sharp-- his power to revisualize the celtic past of Scotland and
to imagine stories of many past that are as native to it as those
handed down in bardic legend or folk-lore.

I have emphasized my belief that in other kinds of writing his attainment is the original, though
still beautiful in its imitativeness, and this imitativeness i will
explain as being due partly to that quality of the play-histrion that
was in him as in so many of Celtic blood, partly to his lack of time
to hew out for himself the way of his own, and partly to his quick
responsiveness to any new beauty pointed out by work that he admired.

It was not again, however, lack of time that prevented his attainment of a larger originality, an originality
in other sorts of writing than the "Seanchas." sharp had a unfortunate
disbelief in early life in the value of technique. In the preface to
the "romantic Ballads"

(1888), for instance, he expressed the belief that "the supreme merit of
a poem is not perfection of art, but that quality of the imagination which
is the source of any real or approximate perfection." this, as i interpret
it means that a poem, when of perfect art, has back of the perfect
art a high imaginative quality; but by his own practice sharp knows
that he thought the quality would write of the movement that had carried
him to fame,-- to fame, i say, because "Fiona Macleod" was famous
for a decade, and not only as the mystery, but as a revealer of a
new beauty in words, and as an widener of horizons.

I have, i think, by this glow in which he wrote them recalled to memory, and without the realization
that he had not got down on paper for others half of the creative force
that was in him altogether we wrote.


  'Heu quantum, fati parva tabella vehit!'

It might seem to strangers a trivial thing, that an obscure court, like the presbytery, should
proceed in the business of induction by one routine rather than by another; but was it a trivial
thing that the power of appointing clergymen should lapse into this perilous dilemma--either
that it should be intercepted by the Scottish clerical order, and thus, that a lordly hierarchy
should be suddenly created, disposing of incomes which, in the aggregate, approach to half
a million annually; or, on the other hand, that this dangerous power, if defeated as a clerical
power, should settle into a tenure exquisitely democratic? Was that trivial? Doubtless, the
Scottish ecclesiastical revenues are not equal, nor nearly equal, to the English; still, it
is true, that Scotland, supposing all her benefices equalized, gives a larger average to each
incumbent than England, of the year 1830. England, in that year, gave an average of [pound
symbol]299 to each beneficiary; Scotland gave an average of [pound symbol]303. That body, therefore,
which wields patronage in Scotland, wields a greater relative power than the corresponding
body in England. Now this body, in Scotland, must finally have been the clerus; but supposing
the patronage to have settled nominally where the Veto Act had placed it, then it would have
settled into the keeping of a fierce democracy. Mr. Forsyth has justly remarked, that in such
a case the hired ploughmen of a parish, mercenary hands that quit their engagements at Martinmas,
and can have no filial interest in the parish, would generally succeed in electing the clergyman.
That man would be elected generally, who had canvassed the parish with the arts and means of
an electioneering candidate; or else, the struggle would lie between the property and the Jacobinism
of the district.

In respect to Jacobinism, the condition of Scotland is much altered from what it was; pauperism
and great towns have worked 'strange defeatures' in Scottish society. A vast capital has arisen
in the west, on a level with the first-rate capitalists of the Continent--with Vienna or with
Naples; far superior in size to Madrid, to Lisbon, to Berlin; more than equal to Rome and Milan;
or again to Munich and Dresden, taken by couples: and, in this point, beyond comparison with
any one of these capitals, that whilst they are connected by slight ties with the circumjacent
country, Glasgow keeps open a communication with the whole land. Vast laboratories of encouragement
to manual skill, too often dissociated from consideration of character; armies of mechanics,
gloomy and restless, having no interfusion amongst their endless files of any gradations corresponding
to a system of controlling officers; these spectacles, which are permanently offered by the
castra stativa of combined mechanics in Glasgow and its dependencies (Paisley, Greenock, &c.),
supported by similar districts, and by turbulent collieries in other parts of that kingdom,
make Scotland, when now developing her strength, no longer the safe and docile arena for popular
movements which once she was, with a people that were scattered and habits that were pastoral.
And at this moment, so fearfully increased is the overbearance of democratic impulses in Scotland,
that perhaps in no European nation--hardly excepting France--has it become more important to
hang weights and retarding forces upon popular movements amongst the laboring classes.

This being so, we have never been able to understand the apparent apathy with which the landed
body met the first promulgation of the Veto Act in May, 1834. Of this apathy, two insufficient
explanations suggest themselves:--1st, It seemed a matter of delicacy to confront the General
Assembly, upon a field which they had clamorously challenged for their own. The question at
issue was tempestuously published to Scotland as a question exclusively spiritual. And by whom
was it thus published? The Southern reader must here not be careless of dates. At present,
viz. in 1844, those who fulminate such views of spiritual jurisdiction, are simply dissenters;
and those who vehemently withstand them are the church, armed with the powers of the church.
Such are the relations between the parties in 1844. But in 1834, the revolutionary party were
not only in the church, but (being the majority) they came forward as the church. The new doctrines
presented themselves at first, not as those of a faction, but of the Scottish kirk assembled
in her highest court. The prestige of that advantage has vanished since then; for this faction,
after first of all falling into a minority, afterwards ceased to be any part or section of
the church; but in that year 1834, such a prestige did really operate; and this must be received
as one of the reasons which partially explain the torpor of the landed body. No one liked to
move first, even amongst those who meant to move. But another reason we find in the conscientious
scruples of many landholders, who hesitated to move at all upon a question then insufficiently
discussed, and in which their own interest was by so many degrees the largest.

These reasons, however, though sufficient for suspense, seem hardly sufficient for not having
solemnly protested against the Veto Act immediately upon its passing the Assembly. Whatever
doubts a few persons might harbor upon the expediency of such an act, evidently it was contrary
to the law of the land. The General Assembly could have no power to abrogate a law passed by
the three estates of the realm. But probably it was the deep sense of that truth which reined
up the national resistance. Sure of a speedy collision between some patron and the infringers
of his right, other parties stood back for the present, to watch the form which such a collision
might assume.

In that same year of 1834, not many months after the passing of the Assembly's Act, came on
the first case of collision; and some time subsequently a second. These two cases, Auchterarder
and Marnoch, commenced in the very same steps, but immediately afterwards diverged as widely
as was possible. In both cases, the rights of the patron and of the presentee were challenged
peremptorily; that is to say, in both cases, parishioners objected to the presentee without
reason shown. The conduct of the people was the same in one case as in the other; that of the
two presbyteries travelled upon lines diametrically opposite. The first case was that of Auchterarder.
The parish and the presbytery concerned, both belonged to Auchterarder; and there the presbytery
obeyed the new law of the Assembly; they rejected the presentee, refusing to take him on trial
of his qualifications: And why? we cannot too often repeat--simply because a majority of a
rustic congregation had rejected him, without attempting to show reason for his rejection.
The Auchterarder presbytery, for their part in this affair, were prosecuted in the Court of
Session by the injured parties--Lord Kinnoul, the patron, and Mr. Young, the presentee. Twice,
upon a different form of action, the Court of Session gave judgment against the presbytery;
twice the case went up by appeal to the Lords; twice the Lords affirmed the judgment of the
court below. In the other case of Marnoch, the presbytery of Strathbogie took precisely the
opposite course. So far from abetting the unjust congregation of rustics, they rebelled against
the new law of the Assembly, and declared, by seven of their number against three, that they
were ready to proceed with the trial of the presentee, and to induct him (if found qualified)
into the benefice. Upon this, the General Assembly suspended the seven members of presbytery.
By that mode of proceeding, the Assembly fancied that they should be able to elude the intentions
of the presbytery; it being supposed that, whilst suspended, the presbytery had no power to
ordain; and that, without ordination, there was no possibility of giving induction. But here
the Assembly had miscalculated. Suspension would indeed have had the effects ascribed to it;
but in the mean time, the suspension, as being originally illegal, was found to be void; and
the presentee, on that ground, obtained a decree from the Court of Session, ordaining the presbytery
of Strathbogie to proceed with the settlement. Three of the ten members composing this presbytery,
resisted; and they were found liable in expenses. The other seven completed the settlement
in the usual form. Here was plain rebellion; and rebellion triumphant. If this were allowed,
all was gone. What should the Assembly do for the vindication of their authority? Upon deliberation,
they deposed the contumacious presbytery from their functions as clergymen, and declared their
churches vacant. But this sentence was found to be a brutum fulmen; the crime was no crime,
the punishment turned out no punishment: and a minority, even in this very Assembly, declared
publicly that they would not consent to regard this sentence as any sentence at all, but would
act in all respects as if no such sentence had been carried by vote. Within their own high
Court of Assembly, it is, however, difficult to see how this refusal to recognise a sentence
voted by a majority could be valid. Outside, the civil courts came into play; but within the
Assembly, surely its own laws and votes prevailed. However, this distinction could bring little
comfort to the Assembly at present; for the illegality of the deposal was now past all dispute;
and the attempt to punish, or even ruin a number of professional brethren for not enforcing
a by-law, when the by-law itself had been found irreconcilable to the law of the land, greatly
displeased the public, as vindictive, oppressive, and useless to the purposes of the Assembly.

Nothing was gained, except the putting on record an implacability that was confessedly impotent.
This was the very lunacy of malice. Mortifying it might certainly seem for the members of a
supreme court, like the General Assembly, to be baffled by those of a subordinate court: but
still, since each party must be regarded as representing far larger interests than any personal
to themselves, trying on either side, not the energies of their separate wits, but the available
resources of law in one of its obscurer chapters, there really seemed no more room for humiliation
to the one party, or for triumph to the other, than there is amongst reasonable men in the
result from a game, where the game is one exclusively of chance.

From this period it is probable that the faction of Non-intrusionists resolved upon abandoning
the church. It was the one sole resource left for sustaining their own importance to men who
were now sinking fast in public estimation. At the latter end of 1842, they summoned a convocation
in Edinburgh. The discussions were private; but it was generally understood that at this time
they concerted a plan for going out from the church, in the event of their failing to alarm
the Government by the notification of this design. We do not pretend to any knowledge of secrets.
What is known to everybody is--that, on the annual meeting of the General Assembly, in May,
1843, the great body of the Non-intrusionists moved out in procession. The sort of theatrical
interest which gathered round the Seceders for a few hurried days in May, was of a kind which
should naturally have made wise men both ashamed and disgusted. It was the merest effervescence
from that state of excitement which is nursed by novelty, by expectation, by the vague anticipation
of a 'scene,' possibly of a quarrel, together with the natural interest in seeing men whose
names had been long before the public in books and periodical journals.

The first measure of the Seceders was to form themselves into a pseudo-General Assembly. When
there are two suns visible, or two moons, the real one and its duplicate, we call the mock
sun a parhelios, and the mock moon a paraselene. On that principle, we must call this mock
Assembly a para-synodos. Rarely, indeed, can we applaud the Seceders in the fabrication of
names. They distinguish as quoad sacra parishes those which were peculiarly quoad politica
parishes; for in that view only they had been interesting to the Non-intrusionists. Again,
they style themselves The Free Church, by way of taunting the other side with being a servile
church. But how are they any church at all? By the courtesies of Europe, and according to usage,
a church means a religious incorporation, protected and privileged by the State. Those who
are not so privileged are usually content with the title of Separatists, Dissenters, or Nonconformists.
No wise man will see either good sense or dignity in assuming titles not appropriate. The very
position and aspect towards the church (legally so called) which has been assumed by the Non-intrusionists--viz.,
the position of protesters against that body, not merely as bearing, amongst other features,
a certain relation to the State, but specifically because they bear that relation, makes it
incongruous, and even absurd, for these Dissenters to denominate themselves a 'church.' But
there is another objection to this denomination--the 'Free Church' have no peculiar and separate
Confession of Faith. Nobody knows what are their credenda--what they hold indispensable for
fellow-membership, either as to faith in mysteries or in moral doctrines. Now, if they reply--'Oh!
as to that, we adopt for our faith all that ever we did profess when members of the Scottish
kirk'--then in effect they are hardly so much as a dissenting body, except in some elliptic
sense. There is a grievous hiatus in their own titledeeds and archives; they supply it by referring
people to the muniment chest of the kirk. Would it not be a scandal to a Protestant church
if she should say to communicants --We have no sacramental vessels, or even ritual; but you
may borrow both from Papal Rome.' Not only, however, is the kirk to lend her Confession, &c.;
but even then a plain rustic will not be able to guess how many parts in his Confession are
or may be affected by the 'reformation' of the Non-intrusionists. Surely, he will think, if
this reformation were so vast that it drove them out of the national church, absolutely exploded
them, then it follows that it must have intervened and indirectly modified innumerable questions:
a difference that was punctually limited to this one or these two clauses, could not be such
a difference as justified a rupture. Besides, if they have altered this one or these two clauses,
or have altered their interpretation, how is any man to know (except from a distinct Confession
of Faith) that they have not even directly altered much more? Notoriety through newspapers
is surely no ground to stand upon in religion. And now it appears that the unlettered rustic
needs two guides--one to show him exactly how much they have altered, whether two points or
two hundred, as well as which two or two hundred; another to teach him how far these original
changes may have carried with them secondary changes as consequences into other parts of the
Christian system. One of the known changes, viz., the doctrine of popular election as the proper
qualification for parish clergymen, possibly is not fitted to expand itself or ramify, except
by analogy. But the other change, the infinity which has been suddenly turned off like a jet
of gas, or like the rushing of wind through the tubes of an organ, upon the doctrine and application
of spirituality, seems fitted for derivative effects that are innumerable. Consequently, we
say of the Non-itrusionists--not only that they are no church; but that they are not even any
separate body of Dissenters, until they have published a 'Confession' or a revised edition
of the Scottish Confession.

IV. Lastly, we have to sum and to appreciate the ultimate consequences of these things. Let
us pursue them to the end of the vista.--First in order stands the dreadful shock to the National
Church Establishment; and that is twofold: it is a shock from without, acting through opinion,
and a shock from within, acting through the contagion of example. Each case is separately perfect.
Through the opinion of men standing outside of the church, the church herself suffers wrong
in her authority. Through the contagion of sympathy stealing over men inside of the church,
peril arises of other shocks in a second series, which would so exhaust the church by reiterated
convulsions, as to leave her virtually dismembered and shattered for all her great national
functions.

As to that evil which acts through opinion, it acts by a machinery, viz. the press and social
centralization in great cities, which in these days is perfect. Right or wrong, justified or
not justified by the acts of the majority, it is certain that every public body--how much more,
then, a body charged with the responsibility of upholding the truth in its standard!--suffers
dreadfully in the world's opinion by any feud, schism, or shadow of change among its members.
This is what the New Testament, a code of philosophy fertile in new ideas, first introduced
under the name of scandal; that is, any occasion of serious offence ministered to the weak
or to the sceptical by differences irreconcilable in the acts or the opinions of those whom
they are bound to regard as spiritual authorities. Now here, in Scotland, is a feud past all
arbitration: here is a schism no longer theoretic, neither beginning nor ending in mere speculation;
here is a change of doctrine, on one side or the other, which throws a sad umbrage of doubt
and perplexity over the pastoral relation of the church to every parish in Scotland. Less confidence
there must always be henceforward in great religious incorporations. Was there any such incorporation
reputed to be more internally harmonious than the Scottish church? None has been so tempestuously
agitated. Was any church more deeply pledged to the spirit of meekness? None has split asunder
so irreconcilably. As to the grounds of quarrel, could any questions or speculations be found
so little fitted for a popular intemperance? Yet no breach of unity has ever propagated itself
by steps so sudden and irrevocable. One short decennium has comprehended within its circuit
the beginning and the end of this unparalleled hurricane. In 1834, the first light augury of
mischief skirted the horizon--a cloud no bigger than a man's hand. In 1843, the evil had 'travelled
on from birth to birth.' Already it had failed in what may be called one conspiracy; already
it had entered upon a second, viz., to rear up an Anti-Kirk, or spurious establishment, which
should twist itself with snake-like folds about the legal establishment; surmount it as a Roman
vinea surmounted the fortifications which it beleaguered; and which, under whatsoever practical
issue for the contest, should at any rate overlook, molest, and insult the true church for
ever. Even this brief period of development would have been briefer, had not the law courts
interposed many delays. Demurs of law process imposed checks upon the uncharitable haste of
the odium theologicum. And though in a question of schism it would be a petitio principii for
a neutral censor to assume that either party had been originally in error, yet it is within
our competence to say, that the Seceders it was whose bigotry carried the dispute to that sad
issue of a final separation. The establishment would have been well content to stop short of
that consummation: and temperaments might have been found, compromises both safe and honorable,
had the minority built less of their reversionary hopes upon the policy of a fanciful martyrdom.
Martyrs they insisted upon becoming: and that they might be martyrs, it was necessary for them
to secede. That Europe thinks at present with less reverence of Protestant institutions than
it did ten years ago, is due to one of these institutions in particular; viz. to the Scottish
kirk, and specifically to the minority in that body. They it was who spurned all mutual toleration,
all brotherly indulgence from either side to what it regarded as error in the other. Consequently
upon their consciences lies the responsibility of having weakened the pillars of the reformed
churches throughout Christendom.

Had those abuses been really such, which the Seceders denounced, were it possible that a primary
law of pure Christianity had been set aside for generations, how came it that evils so gross
had stirred no whispers of reproach before 1834? How came it that no aurora of early light,
no prelusive murmurs of scrupulosity even from themselves, had run before this wild levanter
of change? Heretofore or now there must have been huge error on their own showing. Heretofore
they must have been traitorously below their duty, or now mutinously beyond it.

Such conclusions are irresistible and upon any path, seceding or not seceding, they menace
the worldly credit of ecclesiastical bodies. That evil is now past remedy. I dread lest last night's
business may be misrepresented in the same way.-- you, i beg, will take care to prevent it. I tax
your wish for Mr. Burns'welfare with the task of waiting as soon as possible, on every gentleman who

 It is an act which may cover indifferently a marked hostility to the Secession

And, again, this negative act may be equivocal in a different way; the friendliness may not
only have existed, but may have existed in sufficient strength for any test whatever; not the
principles of the Seceders, but their Jacobinical mode of asserting them, may have proved the
true nerve of the repulsion to many. What is it that we wish the English reader to collect
from these distinctions? Simply that the danger is not yet gone past. The earthquake, says
a great poet, when speaking of the general tendency in all dangers to come round by successive
and reiterated shocks--

  'The earthquake is not satisfied at once.'

All dangers which lie deeply seated are recurrent dangers; they intermit, only as the revolving
lamps of a light-house are periodically eclipsed. The General Assembly of 1843, when closing
her gates upon the Seceders, shut in, perhaps, more of the infected than at the time she succeeded
in shutting out. As respected the opinion of the world outside, it seemed advisable to shut
out the least number possible; for in proportion to the number of the Seceders, was the danger
that they should carry with them an authentic impression in their favor. On the other hand,
as respected a greater danger, (the danger from internal contagion), it seemed advisable that
the church should have shut out (if she could) very many of those who, for the present, adhered
to her. The broader the separation, and the more absolute, between the church and the secession,
so much the less anxiety there would have survived lest the rent should spread. That the anxiety
in this respect is not visionary, the reader may satisfy himself by looking over a remarkable
pamphlet, which professes by its title to separate the wheat from the chaff. By the 'wheat,'
in the view of this writer, is meant the aggregate of those who persevered in their recusant
policy up to the practical result of secession. All who stopped short of that consummation
(on whatever plea), are the 'chaff.' The writer is something of an incendiary, or something
of a fanatic; but he is consistent with regard to his own principles, and so elaborately careful
in his details as to extort admiration of his energy and of his patience in research.

But the reason for which we notice this pamphlet, is, with a view to the proof of that large
intestine mischief which still lingers behind in the vitals of the Scottish establishment.
No proof, in a question of that nature, can be so showy and ostensive to a stranger as that
which is supplied by this vindictive pamphlet. For every past vote recording a scruple, is
the pledge of a scruple still existing, though for the moment suppressed. Since the secession,
nearly four hundred and fifty new men may have entered the church. This supplementary body
has probably diluted the strength of the revolutionary principles. But they also may, perhaps,
have partaken to some extent in the contagion of these principles. True, there is this guarantee
for caution, on the part of these new men, that as yet they are pledged to nothing; and that,
seeing experimentally how fearfully many of their older brethren are now likely to be fettered
by the past, they have every possible motive for reserve, in committing themselves, either
by their votes or by their pens. In their situation, there is a special inducement to prudence,
because there is a prospect, that for them prudence is in time to be effectual. But for many
of the older men, prudence comes too late. They are already fettered. And what we are now pointing
out to the attention of our readers, is, that by the past, by the absolute votes of the past,
too sorrowfully it is made evident, that the Scottish church is deeply tainted with the principles
of the Secession. These germs of evil and of revolution, speaking of them in a personal sense,
cannot be purged off entirely until one generation shall have passed away. But, speaking of
them as principles capable of vegetation, these germs may or may not expand into whole forests
of evil, according to the accidents of coming events, whether fitted to tranquillize our billowy
aspects of society; or, on the other hand, largely to fertilize the many occasions of agitation,
which political fermentations are too sure to throw off. Let this chance turn out as it may,
we repeat for the information of Southerns--that the church, by shutting off the persons of
particular agitators, has not shut off the principles of agitation; and that the cordon sanataire,
supposing the spontaneous exile of the Non-intrusionists to be regarded in that light, was
not drawn about the church until the disease had spread widely within the lines.

Past votes may not absolutely pledge a man to a future course of action; warned in time, such
a man may stand neutral in practice; but thus far they poison the fountains of wholesome unanimity--that,
if a man can evade the necessity of squaring particular actions to his past opinions, at least
he must find himself tempted to square his opinions themselves, or his counsels, to such past
opinions as he may too notoriously have placed on record by his votes.

But, if such are the continual dangers from reactions in the establishment, so long as men
survive in that establishment who feel upbraided by past votes, and so long as enemies survive
who will not suffer these upbraidings to slumber--dangers which much mutual forbearance and
charity can alone disarm; on the other hand, how much profounder is the inconsistency to which
the Free Church is doomed!--They have rent the unity of that church, to which they had pledged
their faith--but on what plea? On the plea that in cases purely spiritual, they could not in
conscience submit to the award of the secular magistrate. Yet how merely impracticable is this
principle, as an abiding principle of action! Churches, that is, the charge of particular congregations,
will be with them (as with other religious communities) the means of livelihood. Grounds innumerable
will arise for excluding or attempting to exclude, each other from these official stations.
No possible form regulating the business of ordination, or of induction, can anticipate the
infinite objections which may arise. But no man interested in such a case, will submit to a
judge appointed by insufficient authority. Daily bread for his family is what few men will
resign without a struggle. And that struggle will of necessity come for final adjudication
to the law courts of the land, whose interference in any question affecting a spiritual interest,
the Free Church has for ever pledged herself to refuse. But in the case supposed, she will
not have the power to refuse it. She will be cited before the tribunals, and can elude that
citation in no way but by surrendering the point in litigation; and if she should adopt the
notion, that it is better for her to do that, than to acknowledge a sufficient authority in
the court by pleading at its bar, upon this principle once made public, she will soon be stripped
of everything, and will cease to be a church at all. She cannot continue to be a depository
of any faith, or a champion of any doctrines, if she lose the means of defending her own incorporations.
But how can she maintain the defenders of her rights, or the dispensers of her truths, if she
refuses, upon immutable principle, to call in the aid of the magistrate on behalf of rights,
which, under any aspect, regard spiritual relations? Attempting to maintain these rights by
private arbitration within a forum of her own, she will soon find such arbitration not binding
at all upon the party who conceives himself aggrieved. The issue will be as in Mr. O'Connell's
courts, where the parties played at going to law; from the moment when they ceased to play,
and no longer 'made believe' to be disputing, the award of the judge became as entire a mockery,
as any stage mimicry of such a transaction.

This should be the natural catastrophe of the case; and the probable evasion of that destructive
consummation, to which she is carried by her principles, will be--that as soon as her feelings
of rancor shall have cooled down, these principles will silently drop out of use; and the very
reason will be suffered to perish for which she ever became a dissenting body. With this, however,
we, that stand outside, are noways concerned. But an evil, in which we are concerned, is the
headlong tendency of the Free Church, and of all churches adulterating with her principle,
to an issue not merely dangerous in a political sense, but ruinous in an anti-social sense.
The artifice of the Free Church lies in pleading a spiritual relation of any case whatever,
whether of doing or suffering, whether positive or negative, as a reason for taking it out
of all civil control. Now we may illustrate the peril of this artifice, by a reality at this
time impending over society in Ireland. Dr. Higgins, titular bishop of Ardagh, has undertaken
upon this very plea of a spiritual power not amenable to civil control, a sort of warfare with
Government, upon the question of their power to suspend or defeat the O'Connell agitation.
For, says he, if Government should succeed in thus intercepting the direct power of haranguing
mobs in open assemblies, then will I harangue them, and cause them to be harangued, in the
same spirit, upon the same topics, from the altar or the pulpit. An immediate extension of
this principle would be--that every disaffected clergyman in the three kingdoms, would lecture
his congregation upon the duty of paying no taxes. This he would denominate passive resistance;
and resistance to bad government would become, in his language, the most sacred of duties.
In any argument with such a man, he would be found immediately falling back upon the principle
of the Free Church; he would insist upon it as a spiritual right, as a ease entirely between
his conscience and God, whether he should press to an extremity any and every doctrine, though
tending to the instant disorganization of society. To lecture against war, and against taxes
as directly supporting war, would wear a most colorable air of truth amongst all weak-minded
persons. And these would soon appear to have been but the first elements of confusion under
the improved views of spiritual rights. The doctrines of the Levellers in Cromwell's time,
of the Anabaptists in Luther's time, would exalt themselves upon the ruins of society, if governments
were weak enough to recognise these spiritual claims in the feeblest of their initial advances.
If it were possible to suppose such chimeras prevailing, the natural redress would soon be
seen to lie through secret tribunals, like those of the dreadful Fehmgericht in the middle
ages. It would be absurd, however, seriously to pursue these anti-social chimeras through their
consequences. Stern remedies would summarily crush so monstrous an evil. Our purpose is answered,
when the necessity of such insupportable consequences is shown to link itself with that distinction
upon which the Free Church has laid the foundations of its own establishment. Once for all,
there is no act or function belonging to an officer of a church which is not spiritual by one
of its two Janus faces. And every examination of the case convinces us more and more that the
Seceders took up the old papal distinction, as to acts spiritual or not spiritual, not under
any delusion less or more, but under a simple necessity of finding some evasion or other which
should meet and embody the whole rancor of the moment.

But beyond any other evil consequence prepared by the Free Church, is the appalling spirit
of Jacobinism which accompanies their whole conduct, and which latterly has avowed itself in
their words. The case began Jacobinically, for it began in attacks upon the rights of property.
But since the defeat of this faction by the law courts, language seems to fail them, for the
expression of their hatred and affected scorn towards the leading nobility of Scotland. Yet
why? The case lies in the narrowest compass. The Duke of Sutherland, and other great landholders,
had refused sites for their new churches. Upon this occurred a strong fact, and strong in both
directions; first, for the Seceders; secondly, upon better information against them. The Record
newspaper, a religious journal, ably and conscientiously conducted, took part with the Secession,
and very energetically; for they denounced the noble duke's refusal of land as an act of 'persecution;'
and upon this principle--that, in a county where his grace was pretty nearly the sole landed
proprietor, to refuse land (assuming that a fair price had been tendered for it) was in effect
to show such intolerance as might easily tend to the suppression of truth. Intolerance, however,
is not persecution; and, if it were, the casuistry of the question is open still to much discussion.
But this is not necessary; for the ground is altogether shifted when the duke's reason for
refusing the land comes to be stated; he had refused it, not unconditionally, not in the spirit
of non-intrusion courts, 'without reason shown,' but on this unanswerable argument--that the
whole efforts of the new church were pointed (and professedly pointed) to the one object of
destroying the establishment, and 'sweeping it from the land.' Could any guardian of public
interests, under so wicked a threat, hesitate as to the line of his duty? By granting the land
to parties uttering such menaces, the Duke of Sutherland would have made himself an accomplice
in the unchristian conspiracy. Meantime, next after this fact, it is the strongest defence
which we can offer for the duke--that in a day or two after this charge of 'persecution,' the
Record was forced to attack the Seceders in terms which indirectly defended the duke. And this,
not in any spirit of levity, but under mere conscientious constraint. For no journal has entered
so powerfully or so eloquently into the defence of the general principle involved in the Secession
(although questioning its expediency), as this particular Record. Consequently, any word of
condemnation from so earnest a friend, comes against the Seceders with triple emphasis. And
this is shown in the tone of the expostulations addressed to the Record by some of the Secession
leaders. It spares us, indeed, all necessity of quoting the vile language uttered by members
of the Free Church Assembly, if we say, that the neutral witnesses of such unchristian outrages
have murmured, remonstrated, protested in every direction; and that Dr, Macfarlane, who has
since corresponded with the Duke of Sutherland upon the whole case--viz. upon the petition
for land, as affected by the shocking menaces of the Seceders--has, in no other way, been able
to evade the double mischief of undertaking a defence for the indefensible, and at the same
time of losing the land irretrievably, than by affecting an unconsciousness of language used
by his party little suited to his own sacred calling, or to the noble simplicities of Christianity.
Certainly it is unhappy for the Seceders, that the only disavowal of the most fiendish sentiments
heard in our days, has come from an individual not authorized or at all commissioned by his
party--from an individual not showing any readiness to face the whole charges, disingenuously
dissembling the worst of them, and finally offering his very feeble disclaimer, which equivocates
between a denial and a palliation--not until after he found himself in the position of a petitioner
for favors.

Specifically the great evil of our days, is the abiding temptation, in every direction, to
popular discontent, to agitation, and to systematic sedition. Now, we say it with sorrow, that
from no other incendiaries have we heard sentiments so wild, fierce, or maliciously democratic,
as from the leaders of the Secession. It was the Reform Bill of 1832, and the accompanying
agitation, which first suggested the veto agitation of 1834, and prescribed its tone. From
all classes of our population, in turn, there have come forward individuals to disgrace themselves
by volunteering their aid to the chief conspirators of the age. We have earls, we have marquesses,
coming forward as Corn-League agents; we have magistrates by scores angling for popularity
as Repealers. But these have been private parties, insulated, disconnected, disowned. When
we hear of Christianity prostituted to the service of Jacobinism--of divinity becoming the
handmaid to insurrection--and of clergymen in masses offering themselves as promoters of anarchy,
we go back in thought to that ominous organization of irreligion, which gave its most fearful
aspects to the French Revolution.

Other evils are in the rear as likely to arise out of the funds provided for the new Seceders,
were the distribution of those funds confessedly unobjectionable, but more immediately under
the present murmurs against that distribution. There are two funds: one subscribed expressly
for the building of churches, the other limited to the 'sustentation' of incumbents. And the
complaint is--that this latter fund has been invaded for purposes connected with the first.
The reader can easily see the motive to this injustice: it is a motive of ambition. Far more
display of power is made by the annunciation to the world of six hundred churches built, than
of any difference this way or that in the comfort and decorous condition of the clergy. This
last is a domestic feature of the case, not fitted for public effect. But the number of the
churches will resound through Europe. Meantime, at present, the allowance to the great body
of Seceding clergy averages but [pound symbol]80 a-year; and the allegation is--that, but for
the improper interference with the fund on the motive stated, it would have averaged [pound
symbol]150 a-year. If anywhere a town parish has raised a much larger provision for its pastor,
even that has now become a part of the general grievance. For it is said that all such special
contributions ought to have been thrown into one general fund--liable to one general principle
of distribution. Yet again, will even this fund, partially as it seems to have been divided,
continue to be available? Much of it lies in annual subscriptions: now, in the next generation
of subscribers, a son will possibly not adopt the views of his father; but assuredly he will
not adopt his father's zeal. Here, however (though this is not probable), there may arise some
compensatory cases of subscribers altogether new. But another question is pressing for decision,
which menaces a frightful shock to the schismatical church: female agency has been hitherto
all potent in promoting the subscriptions; and a demand has been made in consequence--that
women shall be allowed to vote in the church courts. Grant this demand--for it cannot be evaded--and
what becomes of the model for church government as handed down from John Knox and Calvin? Refuse
it, and what becomes of the future subscriptions?

But these are evils, it may be said, only for the Seceders. Not so: we are all interested in
the respectability of the national teachers, whatever be their denomination: we are all interested
in the maintenance of a high standard for theological education. These objects are likely to
suffer at any rate. But it is even a worse result which we may count on from the changes, that
a practical approximation is thus already made to what is technically known as Voluntaryism.

The 'United Secession,' that is the old collective body of Scottish Dissenters, who, having
no regular provision, are carried into this voluntary system, already exult that this consummation
of the case cannot be far off. Indeed, so far as the Seceders are dependent upon annual subscriptions,
and coupling that relation to the public with the great doctrine of these Seceders, that congregations
are universally to appoint their own pastors, we do not see how such an issue is open to evasion.
The leaders of the new Secession all protest against Voluntaryism: but to that complexion of
things they travel rapidly by the mere mechanic action of their dependent (or semi-dependent)
situation, combined with one of their two characteristic principles.

The same United Secession journal openly anticipates another and more diffusive result from
this great movement; viz. the general disruption of church establishments. We trust that this
anticipation will be signally defeated. And yet there is one view of the case which saddens
us when we turn our eyes in that direction. Among the reasonings and expostulations of the
Schismatic church, one that struck us as the most eminently hypocritical, and ludicrously so,
was this: 'You ought,' said they, when addressing the Government, and exposing the error of
the law proceedings, 'to have stripped us of the temporalities arising from the church, stipend,
glebe, parsonage, but not of the spiritual functions. We had no right to the emoluments of
our stations, when the law courts had decided against us, but we had a right to the laborious
duties of the stations.' No gravity could refuse to smile at this complaint--verbally so much
in the spirit of primitive Christianity, yet in its tendency so insidious. For could it be
possible that a competitor introduced by the law, and leaving the duties of the pastoral office
to the old incumbent, but pocketing the salary, should not be hooted on the public roads by
many who might otherwise have taken no part in the feud? This specious claim was a sure and
brief way to secure the hatefulness of their successors. Now, we cannot conceal from ourselves
that something like this invidious condition of things might be realized under two further
revolutions. We have said, that a second schism in the Scottish church is not impossible. It
is also but too possible that Puseyism may yet rend the English establishment by a similar
convulsion. But in such contingencies, we should see a very large proportion of the spiritual
teachers in both nations actually parading to the public eye, and rehearsing something very
like the treacherous proposal of the late Seceders, viz., the spectacle of one party performing
much of the difficult duties, and another party enjoying the main emoluments. This would be
a most unfair mode of recommending Voluntaryism. Falling in with the infirmities of many in
these days, such a spectacle would give probably a fatal bias to that system in our popular
and Parliamentary counsels. This would move the sorrow of the Seceders themselves: for they
have protested against the theory of all Voluntaries with a vehemence which that party even
complain of as excessive. Their leaders have many times avowed, that any system which should
leave to men in general the estimate of their own religious wants as a pecuniary interest,
would be fatal to the Christian tone of our national morals. Checked and overawed by the example
of an establishment, the Voluntaries themselves are far more fervent in their Christian exertions
than they could be when liberated from that contrast. The religious spirit of both England
and Scotland under such a change would droop for generations. And in that one evil, let us
hope, the remotest and least probable of the many evils threatened by the late schism, these
nations would have reason by comparison almost to forget the rest.

TOILETTE OF THE HEBREW LADY.

EXHIBITED IN SIX SCENES.

[1828.]

[TO THE EDITOR OF BLACKWOOD'S MAGAZINE.]

Sir,--Some years ago you published a translation of Bottiger's 'Sabina,' a learned account
of the Roman toilette. I here send you a companion to that work--not a direct translation,
but a very minute abstract from a similar dissertation by Hartmann, (weeded of the wordiness
which has made the original unreadable, and in consequence unread,) on the toilette and the
wardrobe of the ladies of ancient Palestine. Hartmann was a respectable Oriental scholar, and
he published his researches, which occupy three thick octavos, making in all one thousand four
hundred and eighty-eight pages, under the title of Die Hebraerin am Putztische und als Braut,
Amsterdam, 1809. (The Hebrew Woman at her Toilette, and in her Bridal character.) I understand
that the poor man is now gone to Hades, where let us hope that it is considered no crime in
a learned man to be exceedingly tedious, and to repeat the same thing ten times over, or even,
upon occasion, fifteen times, provided that his own upright heart should incline him to think
that course the most advisable. Certainly Mr. Hartmann has the most excellent gifts at verbal
expansion, and at tautology, that ever came within my knowledge; and I found no particular
difficulty in compressing every tittle of what relates to his subject, into a compass which,
I imagine, will fill about twelve of your pages, or fifty, at the utmost, of the original work.

It was not to be expected, with the scanty materials before him, that an illustrator of the
Hebrew costume should be as full and explicit as Bottiger, with the advantage of writing upon
a theme more familiar to us Europeans of this day, than any parallel theme even in our own
national archaeologies of two centuries back. United, however, with his great reading, this
barrenness of the subject is so far an advantage for Hartmann, as it yields a strong presumption
that he has exhausted it. The male costume of ancient Palestine is yet to be illustrated; but,
for the female, it is probable that little could be added to what Hartmann has collected; [Footnote
1] and that any clever dress-maker would, with the indications here given, (especially if you
could persuade Mr. Blackwood to adopt one or two of Mr. Hartmann's seven outlines,) enable
any lady at the next great masquerade in London, to support the part of one of the ancient
daughters of Palestine, and to call back, after eighteen centuries of sleep, the buried pomps
of Jerusalem. As to the talking, there would be no difficulty at all in that point; bishops,
and other 'sacred' people, if they ever go a-masquing, for their own sakes will not be likely
to betray themselves by putting impertinent questions in Hebrew; and for 'profane' people,
who might like the impertinence, they would very much dislike the Hebrew; indeed, of uncircumcised
Hebrews, barring always the clergy, it is not thought that any are extant. In other respects,
and as a spectacle, the Hebrew masque would infallibly eclipse every other in the room. The
upper and under chemise, if managed properly, (and either you or I, Mr. North, would be most
proud to communicate our private advice on that subject,) would transcend, in gorgeous display,
the coronation robes of queens; nose-pendants would cause the masque to be immediately and
unerringly recognised; or if those were not thought advisable, the silver ankle-bells, with
their melodious chimes--the sandals, with their jewelled net-work--and the golden diadem, binding
the forehead, and dropping from each extremity of the polished temples a rouleau of pearls,
which, after traversing the cheeks, unite below the chin--are all so unique and exclusively
Hebraic--that each and all would have the same advantageous effect, proclaiming and notifying
the character, without putting the fair supporter to any disagreeable expense of Hebrew or
Chaldee. The silver bells alone would 'bear the bell' from every competitor in the room; and
she might besides carry a cymbal--a dulcimer--or a timbrel in her hands.

In conclusion, my dear North, let me congratulate you that Mr. Hartmann is now in Hades (as
I said before) rather than in Edinburgh; for, had he been in this latter place, he would have
been the ruin of you. It was his intention, as I am well assured, just about the time that
he took his flight for Hades, to have commenced regular contributor to your journal; so great
was his admiration of you, and also of the terms which you offer to the literary world. As
a learned Orientalist, you could not decorously have rejected him; and yet, once admitted,
he would have beggared you before any means could have been discovered by the learned for putting
a stop to him. [Greek Text: Aperantologia] was his forte; upon this he piqued himself, and
most justly, since for covering the ground rapidly, and yet not advancing an inch, those, who
knew and valued him as he deserved, would have backed him against the whole field of the gens
de plume now in Europe. Had he lived, and fortunately for himself communicated his Hebrew Toilette
to the world through you, instead of foundering (as he did) at Amsterdam, he would have flourished
upon your exchequer; and you would not have heard the last of him or his Toilette, for the
next twenty years. He dates, you see, from Amsterdam; and, had you been weak enough to take
him on board, he would have proved that 'Flying Dutchman' that would infallibly have sunk your
vessel.

The more is your obligation to me, I think, for sweating him down to such slender dimensions.
And, speaking seriously, both of us perhaps will rejoice that even with his talents for telling
everything, he was obliged on this subject to leave many things untold. For, though it might
be gratifying to a mere interest of curiosity, yet I believe that we should both be grieved
if anything were to unsettle in our feelings the mysterious sanctities of Jerusalem, or to
disturb that awful twilight which will for ever brood over Judea--by letting in upon it the
'common light of day;' and this effect would infallibly take place, if any one department of
daily life, as it existed in Judea, were brought with all the degrading minutiae of its details
within the petty finishing of a domestic portrait.

Farewell, my dear North, and believe me to be always your old friend and admirer,

[Greek Text: Cap Omega, Cap Phi]

SCENE THE FIRST.

I. That simple body-cloth framed of leaves, skins, flax, wool, &c. which modesty had first
introduced, for many centuries perhaps sufficed as the common attire of both sexes amongst
the Hebrew Bedouins. It extended downwards to the knees, and upwards to the hips, about which
it was fastened. Such a dress is seen upon many of the figures in the sculptures of Persepolis;
even in modern times, Niebuhr found it the ordinary costume of the lower Arabians in Hedsjas;
and Shaw assures us, that from its commodious shape, it is still a favorite dishabille of the
Arabian women when they are behind the curtains of the tent.

From this early rudiment was derived, by gradual elongation, that well-known under habiliment,
which in Hebrew is called Ch'tonet, and in Greek and Latin by words of similar sound. [Footnote
2] In this stage of its progress, when extended to the neck and the shoulders, it represents
pretty accurately the modern shirt, or chemise--except that the sleeves are wanting; and during
the first period of Jewish history, it was probably worn as the sole under-garment by women
of all ranks, both amongst the Bedouin Hebrews and those who lived in cities. A very little
further extension to the elbows and the calves of the legs, and it takes a shape which survives
even to this day in Asia. Now, as then, the female habiliment was distinguished from the corresponding
male one by its greater length; and through all antiquity we find long clothes a subject of
reproach to men, as an argument of effeminacy.

According to the rank or vanity of the wearer, this tunic was made of more or less costly materials;
for wool and flax was often substituted the finest byssus, or other silky substance; and perhaps,
in the latter periods, amongst families of distinction in Jerusalem, even silk itself. Splendor
of coloring was not neglected; and the opening at the throat was eagerly turned to account
as an occasion for displaying fringe or rich embroidery.

Bottiger remarks, that, even in the age of Augustus, the morning dress of Roman ladies when
at home was nothing more than this very tunic; which, if it sate close, did not even require
a girdle. The same remark applies to the Hebrew women, who, during the nomadic period of their
history, had been accustomed to wear no night-chemises at all, but slept quite naked, or, at
the utmost, with a cestus or zone: by way of bed-clothes, however, it must be observed, that
they swathed their person in the folds of a robe or shawl. Up to the time of Solomon, this
practice obtained through all ranks; and so long the universal household dress of a Hebrew
lady in her harem, was the tunic as here described; and in this she dressed herself the very
moment that she rose from bed. Indeed, so long as the Hebrew women were content with a single
tunic, it flowed loose in liberal folds about the body; and was fastened by a belt or a clasp,
just as we find it at this day amongst all Asiatic nations. But, when a second under-garment
was introduced, the inner one fitted close to the shape, whilst the outer one remained full
and free as before.

II. No fashion of the female toilette is of higher antiquity than that of dyeing the margin
of the eyelids and the eyebrows with a black pigment. It is mentioned or alluded to, 2 Kings,
ix. 30, Jerem. iv. 30, Ezek. xxiii. 40; to which may be added, Isaiah, iii. 16. The practice
had its origin in a discovery made accidentally in Egypt. For it happens, that the substance
used for this purpose in ancient times, is a powerful remedy in cases of ophthalmia and inflammation
of the eyes;--complaints to which Egypt is, from local causes, peculiarly exposed. This endemic
infirmity, in connection with the medical science for which Egypt was so distinguished, easily
account for their discovering the uses of antimony, which is the principal ingredient in the
pigments of this class. Egypt was famous for the fashion of painting the face from an early
period: and in some remarkable curiosities illustrating the Egyptian toilette, which were discovered
in the catacombs of Sahara in Middle Egypt, there was a single joint of a common reed containing
an ounce or more of the coloring powder, and one of the needles for applying it. The entire
process was as follows:--The mineral powder, finely prepared, was mixed up with a preparation
of vinegar and gall-apples--sometimes with oil of almonds, or other oils--sometimes, by very
luxurious women, with costly gums and balsams. [Footnote 3] And perhaps, as Sonnini describes
the practice among the Mussulman women at present, the whole mass thus compounded was dried
and again reduced to an impalpable powder, and consistency then given to it by the vapors of
some odorous and unctuous substance. Thus prepared, the pigment was applied to the tip or pointed
ferule of a little metallic pencil, called, in Hebrew, Makachol, and made of silver, gold,
or ivory; the eyelids were then closed, and the little pencil, or probe, held horizontally,
was inserted between them:--a process which is briefly and picturesquely described in the Bible.
The effect of the black rim, which the pigment traced about the eyelid, was to throw a dark
and majestic shadow over the eye; to give it a languishing and yet a lustrous expression; to
increase its apparent size, and to apply the force of contrast to the white of the eye. Together
with the eyelids, the Hebrew women colored the eyebrows, the point aimed at being twofold--to
curve them into a beautiful arch of brilliant ebony--and, at the same time, to make the inner
ends meet or flow into each other.

III. Ear-rings of gold, silver, inferior metals, or even horn, were worn by the Hebrew women
in all ages; and in the flourishing period of the Jewish kingdom, probably by men: and so essential
an ornament were they deemed, that in the idolatrous times, even the images of their false
gods were not considered becomingly attired without them. Their ear-rings were larger, according
to the Asiatic taste; but whether quite large enough to admit the hand, is doubtful. In a later
age, as we collect from the Thalmud, Part VI. 43, the Jewish ladies wore gold or silver pendants,
of which the upper part was shaped like a lentil, and the lower hollowed like a little cup
or pipkin. It is probable also, that, even in the oldest ages, it was a practice amongst them
to suspend gold and silver rings, not merely from the lower, but also from the upper end of
the ear, which was perforated like a sieve. The tinkling sound, with which, upon the slightest
motion, two or three tiers of rings would be set a-dancing about the cheeks, was very agreeable
to the baby taste of the Asiatics.

From a very early age, the ears of Hebrew women were prepared for this load of trinketry; for,
according to the Thalmud, II. 23, they kept open the little holes, after they were pierced,
by threads or slips of wood: a fact which may show the importance they attached to this ornament.

IV. Nose-rings, at an early period, became a universal ornament in Palestine. We learn, from
Biblical and from Arabic authority, that it was a practice of Patriarchal descent amongst both
the African and Asiatic Bedouins, to suspend rings of iron, wood, or braided hair, from the
nostrils of camels, oxen, &c.--the rope by which the animal was guided being attached to these
rings. It is probable, therefore, that the early Hebrews who dwelt in tents, and who, in the
barrenness of desert scenery, drew most of their hints for improving their personal embellishment
from the objects immediately about them, were indebted for their nose-rings to this precedent
of their camels. Sometimes a ring depended from both nostrils; and the size of it was equal
to that of the ear-ring; so that, at times, its compass included both upper and under lip,
as in the frame of a picture; and, in the age succeeding to Solomon's reign, we hear of rings
which were not less than three inches in diameter. Hebrew ladies of distinction had sometimes
a cluster of nose-rings, as well for the tinkling sound which they were contrived to emit,
as for the shining light which they threw off upon the face.

That the nose-ring possessed no unimportant place in the Jewish toilette, is evident, from
its being ranked, during the nomadic state of the Israelites, as one of the most valuable presents
that a young Hebrew woman could receive from her lover. Amongst the Midianites, who were enriched
by the caravan commerce, even men adopted this ornament: and this appears to have been the
case in the family to which Job belonged, [chap. xli. 2.] Under these circumstances, we should
naturally presume that the Jewish courtezans, in the cities of Palestine, would not omit so
conspicuous a trinket, with its glancing lights, and its tinkling sound: this we might presume,
even without the authority of the Bible: but, in fact, both Isaiah and Ezekiel expressly mention
it amongst their artifices of attraction.

Judith, when she appeared before the tent of Holofernes in the whole pomp of her charms, and
appareled with the most elaborate attention to splendor of effect, for the purpose of captivating
the hostile general, did not omit this ornament. Even the Jewish Proverbs show how highly it
was valued; and that it continued to be valued in later times, appears from the ordinances
of the Thalmud, II. 21, in respect to the parts of the female wardrobe which were allowed to
be worn on the Sabbath.

V. The Hebrew women of high rank, in the flourishing period of their state, wore NECKLACES
composed of multiple rows of pearls. The thread on which the pearls were strung, was of flax
or woollen,--and sometimes colored, as we learn from the Thalmud, VI. 43; and the different
rows were not exactly concentric; but whilst some invested the throat, others descended to
the bosom; and in many cases, even to the zone. On this part of the dress was lavished the
greatest expense; and the Roman reproach was sometimes true of a Hebrew family, that its whole
estate was locked up in a necklace. Tertullian complains heavily of a particular pearl necklace,
which had cost about ten thousand pounds of English money--as of an enormity of extravagance.
But, after making every allowance for greater proximity to the pearl fisheries, and for other
advantages enjoyed by the people of Palestine, there is reason to believe that some Hebrew
ladies possessed single pearls which had cost at least five times that sum. [Footnote 4] So
much may be affirmed, without meaning to compare the most lavish of the ladies of Jerusalem
with those of Rome, where it is recorded of some elegantes, that they actually slept with little
bags of pearls suspended from their necks, that even when sleeping, they might have mementos
of their pomp.

But the Hebrew necklaces were not always composed of pearls, or of pearls only--sometimes it
was the custom to interchange the pearls with little golden bulbs or berries: sometimes they
were blended with the precious stones; and at other times, the pearls were strung two and two,
and their beautiful whiteness relieved by the interposition of red coral.

VI. Next came the BRACELETS of gold or ivory, and fitted up at the open side with a buckle
or enamelled clasp of elaborate workmanship. These bracelets were also occasionally composed
of gold or silver thread; and it was not unusual for a series of them to ascend from the wrist
to the elbow. From the clasp, or other fastening of the bracelet, depended a delicate chain-work
or netting of gold; and in some instances, miniature festoons of pearls. Sometimes the gold
chain-work was exchanged for little silver bells, which could be used, upon occasion, as signals
of warning or invitation to a lover.

VII. This bijouterie for the arms, naturally reminded the Hebrew lady of the ANKLE-BELLS, and
other similar ornaments for the feet and legs. These ornaments consisted partly in golden belts,
or rings, which, descending from above the ankle, compressed the foot in various parts, and
partly in shells and little jingling chains, which depended so as to strike against clappers
fixed into the metallic belts. The pleasant tinkle of the golden belts in collision, the chains
rattling, and the melodious chime of little silver ankle-bells, keeping time with the motions
of the foot, made an accompaniment so agreeable to female vanity, that the stately daughters
of Jerusalem, with their sweeping trains flowing after them, appear to have adopted a sort
of measured tread, by way of impressing a regular cadence upon the music of their feet. The
chains of gold were exchanged, as luxury advanced, for strings of pearls and jewels, which
swept in snaky folds about the feet and ankles.

This, like many other peculiarities in the Hebrew dress, had its origin in a circumstance of
their early nomadic life. It is usual with the Bedouins to lead the camel, when disposed to
be restive, by a rope or a belt fastened to one of the fore feet, sometimes to both; and it
is also a familiar practice to soothe and to cheer the long-suffering animal with the sound
of little bells, attached either to the neck or to one of the fore legs. Girls are commonly
employed to lead the camels to water; and it naturally happened, that, with their lively fancies,
some Hebrew or Arabian girl should be prompted to repeat, on her own person, what had so often
been connected with an agreeable impression in her mule companions to the well.

It is probable, however, that afterwards, having once been introduced, this fashion was supported
and extended by Oriental jealousy. For it rendered all clandestine movements very difficult
in women; and by giving notice of their approach, it had the effect of preparing men for their
presence, and keeping the road free from all spectacles that could be offensive to female delicacy.

From the Hebrew Bedouins, this custom passed to all the nations of Asia; Medes, Persians, Lydians,
Arabs, &c., and is dwelt on with peculiar delight by the elder Arabic poets. That it had spread
to the westernmost parts of Africa, early in the Christian times, we learn from Tertullian,
who cannot suppress his astonishment, that the foolish women of his time should bear to inflict
such compression upon their tender feet. Even as early as the times of Herodotus, we find,
from his account of a Lybian nation, that the women and girls universally wore copper rings
about their ankles. And at an after period, these ornaments were so much cherished by the Egyptian
ladies, that, sooner than, appear in public without their tinkling ankle-chimes, they preferred
to bury themselves in the loneliest apartments of the harem.

Finally, the fashion spread partially into Europe; to Greece even, and to polished Rome, in
so far as regarded the ankle-belts, and the other ornamental appendages, with the single exception
of the silver bells; these were too entirely in the barbaresque taste, to support themselves
under the frown of European culture.

VIII. The first rude sketch of the Hebrew SANDAL may be traced in that little tablet of undrest
hide which the Arabs are in the habit of tying beneath the feet of their camels. This primitive
form, after all the modifications and improvements it has received, still betrays itself to
an attentive observer, in the very-latest fashions of the sandal which Palestine has adopted.

To raw hides succeeded tanned leather, made of goat-skin, deer-skin, &c.; this, after being
accurately cut out to the shape of the sole, was fastened on the bare upper surface of the
foot by two thongs, of which one was usually carried within the great toe, and the other in
many circumvolutions round about the ankles, so that both finally met and tied just above the
instep.

The laced sole, or sandal, of this form, continued in Palestine to be the universal out-of-doors
protection for the feet, up to the Christian-era; and it served for both sexes alike. It was
not, however, worn within doors. At the threshold of the inner apartments the sandals were
laid aside; and visitors from a distance were presented with a vessel of water to cleanse the
feet from the soiling of dust and perspiration. [Footnote 5]

With this extreme simplicity in the form of the foot apparel, there was no great field for
improvement. The article contained two parts--the sole and the fastening. The first, as a subject
for decoration, was absolutely desperate; coarse leather being exchanged for fine, all was
done that could be done; and the wit of man was able to devise no further improvement. Hence
it happened, that the whole power of the inventive faculty was accumulated upon the fastenings,
as the only subject that remained. These were infinitely varied. Belts of bright yellow, of
purple, and of crimson, were adopted by ladies of distinction--especially those of Palestine,
and it was a trial of art to throw these into the greatest possible varieties of convolution,
and to carry them on to a nexus of the happiest form, by which means a reticulation, or trellis-work,
was accomplished, of the most brilliant coloring, which brought into powerful relief the dazzling
color of the skin.

It is possible that, in the general rage for ornaments of gold which possessed the people of
Palestine, during the ages of excessive luxury, the beauties of Jerusalem may have adopted
gilt sandals with gilt fastenings, as the ladies of Egypt did. It is possible, also, that the
Hebrew ladies adopted at one time, in exchange for the sandal, slippers that covered the entire
foot, such as were once worn at Babylon, and are still to be seen on many of the principal
figures on the monuments of Persepolis; and, if this were really so, ample scope would, in
that case, have been obtained for inventive art: variations without end might then have been
devised on the fashion or the materials of the subject; and by means of color, embroidery,
and infinite combinations of jewellery and pearls, an unceasing stimulation of novelty applied
to the taste of the gorgeous Asiatic.

IX. The VEIL, of various texture--coarse or fine--according to circumstances, was thrown over
the head by the Hebrew lady, when she was unexpectedly surprised, or when a sudden noise gave
reason to expect the approach of a stranger. This beautiful piece of drapery, which flowed
back in massy folds over the shoulders, is particularly noticed by Isaiah, as holding an indispensable
place in the wardrobe of his haughty country-women; and in this it was that the enamored Hebrew
woman sought the beloved of her heart.

ADDENDA TO SCENE THE FIRST.

I. Of the Hebrew ornaments for the throat, some were true necklaces, in the modern sense, of
several rows, the outermost of which descended to the breast, and had little pendulous cylinders
of gold, (in the poorer classes, of copper,) so contrived as to make a jingling sound on the
least motion of the person; others were more properly golden stocks, or throat-bands, fitted
so close as to produce in the spectator an unpleasant imagination (and in the wearer, as we
learn from the Thalmud, VI. 43, until reconciled by use, an actual feeling) of constriction
approaching to suffocation. Necklaces were, from the earliest times, a favorite ornament of
the male sex in the East; and expressed the dignity of the wearer, as we see in the instances
of Joseph, of Daniel, &c.; indeed the gold chain of office, still the badge of civic (and until
lately, of military) dignities, is no more than the outermost row of the Oriental necklace.
Philo of Alexandria, and the other Arabian poets, give us some idea of the importance attached
by the women of Asia to this beautiful ornament, and of the extraordinary money value which
it sometimes bore: and from the case of the necklace of gold and amber, in the 15th Odyssey,
(v. 458,) combined with many other instances of the same kind, there can be no doubt that it
was the neighboring land of Phoenicia from which the Hebrew women obtained their necklaces,
and the practice of wearing them.

II. The fashion, however, of adorning the necklace with golden Suns and Moons, so agreeable
to the Hebrew ladies of Isaiah's time, (chap. iii. 18,) was not derived from Phoenicia, but
from Arabia. At an earlier period, (Judges, viii. 21,) the camels of the Midianites were adorned
with golden moons, which also decorated the necks of the emirs of that nomadic tribe. These
appendages were not used merely by way of ornament, but originally as talismans, or amulets,
against sickness, danger, and every species of calamity to which the desert was liable. The
particular form of the amulet is to be explained out of the primitive religion, which prevailed
in Arabia up to the rise of Mahometanism, in the seventh century of Christianity, viz. the
Sabean religion, or worship of the heavenly host--sun, moon, and stars, the most natural of
all modes of idolatry, and especially to a nomadic people in flat and pathless deserts, without
a single way-mark or guidance for their wanderings, except what they drew from the silent heavens
above them. It is certain, therefore, that, long before their emigration into Palestine, the
Israelites had received the practice of wearing suns and moons from the Midianites; even after
their settlement in Palestine, it is certain that the worship of the starry host struck root
pretty deeply at different periods; and that, to the sun and moon, in particular, were offered
incense and libations.

From Arabia, this fashion diffused itself over many countries; [Footnote 6] and it was not
without great displeasure that, in a remote age, Jerome and Tertullian discovered this idolatrous
ornament upon the bosoms of their countrywomen.

The crescents, or half-moons of silver, in connection with the golden suns, [Footnote 6] were
sometimes set in a brilliant frame that represented a halo, and still keep their ground on
the Persian and Turkish toilette, as a favorite ornament.

III. The GOLDEN SNAKES, worn as one of the Hebrew appendages to the necklace, had the same
idolatrous derivation, and originally were applied to the same superstitious use--as an amulet,
or prophylactic ornament. To minds predisposed to this sort of superstition, the serpent came
specially recommended under the circumstances of the Hebrews, from the conspicuous part which
this reptile sustains in the mythologies of the East. From the earliest periods to which tradition
ascends, serpents of various species were consecrated to the religious feelings of Egypt, by
temples, sacrifices, and formal rites of worship. This mode of idolatry had at various periods
infected Palestine. According to 2 Kings, xviii. 4, at the accession of King Hezekiah, the
Israelites had raised peculiar altars to a great brazen serpent, and burned incense upon them.
Even at this day the Abyssinians have an unlimited reverence for serpents; and the blacks in
general regard them as fit subjects for divine honors. Sonnini (II. 388) tells us, that a serpent's
skin is still looked upon in Egypt as a prophylactic against complaints of the head, and also
as a certain cure for them. And of the same origin, no doubt, was the general belief of antiquity,
(according to Pliny, 30, 12,) that the serpent's skin was a remedy for spasms. That the golden
serpent kept its place as an ornament of the throat and bosom after the Christian era, we learn
from Clement of Alexandria. That zealous father, so intolerant of superstitious mummery under
every shape, directs his efforts against this fashion as against a--device of the devil.

IV. To the lowest of the several concentric circles which composed the necklace, was attached
a little box, exquisitely wrought in silver or gold, sometimes an onyx phial of dazzling whiteness,
depending to the bosom or even to the cincture, and filled with the rarest aromas and odorous
spices of the East. What were the favorite essences preserved in this beautiful appendage to
the female costume of Palestine, it is not possible at this distance of time to determine with
certainty--Isaiah having altogether neglected the case, and Hosea (who appears to allude to
it, ii. 14) having only once distinctly mentioned it, (ii. 20.) However, the Thalmud particularizes
musk, and the delightful oil distilled from the leaf of the aromatic malabathrum of Hindostan.
To these we may venture to add, oil of spikenard, myrrh, balsams, attar of roses, and rose-water,
as the perfumes usually contained in the Hebrew scent-pendants. Rose-water, which I am the
first to mention as a Hebrew perfume, had, as I presume, a foremost place on the toilette of
a Hebrew belle. Express scriptural authority for it undoubtedly there is none; but it is notorious
that Palestine availed itself of all the advantages of Egypt, amongst which the rose in every
variety was one. Fium, a province of central Egypt, which the ancients called the Garden of
Egypt, was distinguished for innumerable species of the rose, and especially for those of the
most balsamic order, and for the most costly preparations from it. The Thalmud not only speaks
generally of the mixtures made by tempering it with oil, (i. 135,) but expressly cites (ii.
41) a peculiar rose-water as so costly an essence, that from its high price alone it became
impossible to introduce the use of it into the ordinary medical practice. Indeed this last
consideration, and the fact that the highly-prized quintessence cannot be obtained except from
an extraordinary multitude of the rarest roses, forbid us to suppose that women of the first
rank in Jerusalem could have made a very liberal use of rose-water. In our times, Savary found
a single phial of it in the place of its manufacture, valued at four francs. As to the oil
of roses, properly so called, which floats in a very inconsiderable quantity upon the surface
of distilled rose-water, it is certain that the Hebrew ladies were not acquainted with it.
This preparation can be obtained only from the balsamic roses of Fium, of Shiras, of Kerman,
and of Kashmire, which surpass all the roses of the earth in power and delicacy of odor; and
it is matter of absolute certainty, and incontrovertibly established by the celebrated Langles,
that this oil, which even in the four Asiatic countries just mentioned, ranks with the greatest
rarities, and in Shiras itself is valued at its weight in gold, was discovered by mere accident,
on occasion of some festival solemnity in the year 1612.

V. To what I said, in the first scene of my exhibition, about the Hebrew ear-ornaments, I may add,

1. That sometimes, as Best remarked of the Hindoo dancing-girls, their ears were swollen from
the innumerable perforations drilled into them to support their loads of trinketry.

2. That in the large pendants of coral which the Hebrew ladies were accustomed to attach to
their ears, either in preference to jewels, or in alternation with jewels, they particularly
delighted in that configuration which imitated a cluster of grapes.

3. That, in ear-rings made of gold, they preferred the form of drops, or of globes and bulbs.

4. That of all varieties, however, of this appendage, pearls maintained the preference amongst
the ladies of Palestine, and were either strung upon a thread, or attached by little hooks--singly
or in groups, according to their size. This taste was very early established amongst the Jews,
and chiefly, perhaps, through their intercourse with the Midianites, amongst whom we find the
great Emirs wearing pearl ornaments of this class.

Mutatis mutandis, these four remarks apply to the case of the nose ornaments.

SCENE THE SECOND.

I. THE HAIR.--This section I omit altogether; though with more room at my disposal, it would
be well worth translating as a curiosity. It is the essay of a finished and perfect knave,
who not merely being rather bare of facts, but having literally not one solitary fact of any
kind or degree, sits down to write a treatise on the mode of dressing hair amongst Hebrew ladies.
Samson's hair, and the dressing it got from the Philistines, is the nearest approach that he
ever makes to his subject; and being conscious that this case of Samson and the Philistines
is the one sole allusion to the subject of Hebrew hair that he is possessed of, he brings it
round upon the reader as often perhaps as it will bear--viz. not oftener than once every sixth
page. The rest is one continued shuffle to avoid coming upon the ground; and upon the whole,
though too barefaced, yet really not without ingenuity. Take, by way of specimen, his very
satisfactory dissertation on the particular sort of combs which the Hebrew ladies were pleased
to patronize.

'COMBS.--Whether the ladies of Palestine had upon their toilette a peculiar comb for parting
the hair, another for turning it up, &c.; as likewise whether their combs were, as in ancient
Rome, made of box-wood, or of ivory, or other costly and appropriate material, all these are
questions upon which I--am not able, upon my honor, to communicate the least information. But,
from the general silence of antiquity, prophets and all, [Footnote 7] upon the subject of Hebrew
combs, my own private opinion is, that the ladies used their fingers for this purpose; in which
case, there needs no more to be said on the subject of Hebrew combs.'

II. PERFUMES.--Before, however, the hair received its final arrangement from the hands of the
waiting maid, it was held open and dishevelled to receive the fumes of frankincense, aloes-wood,
cassia, costmary and other odorous woods, gums, balsams, and spices of India, Arabia, or Palestine--placed
upon glowing embers, in vessels of golden fretwork. It is probable, also, that the Hebrew ladies
used amber, bisam, and the musk of Thibet; and when fully arranged, the hair was sprinkled
with oil of nard, myrrh, oil of cinnamon, &c. The importance attached to this part of the Hebrew
toilette may be collected indeed from an ordinance, of the Thalmud, III. 80, which directs
that the bridegroom shall set apart one-tenth of the income which the bride brings him, for
the purchase of perfumes, essences, precious ointments, &c. All these articles were preserved
either in golden boxes, or in little oval narrow-necked phials of dazzling white alabaster,
which bore the name of onyx, from its resemblance to the precious stone of that name, but was
in fact a very costly sort of marble, obtained in the quarries of Upper Egypt, or those of
the Libanus in Syria. Indeed, long before the birth of Christ, alabaster was in such general
use for purposes of this kind in Palestine, that it became the generic name for valuable boxes,
no matter of what material. To prevent the evaporation of the contents, the narrow neck of
the phial was resealed every time that it was opened. It is probable, also, that the myrrhine
cups, about which there has been so much disputing, were no strangers to the Jewish toilette.

III. THE MIRROR was not made of glass, (for glass mirrors cannot be shown to have existed before
the thirteenth century,) but of polished metals; and amongst these, silver was in the greatest
esteem, as being capable of a higher burnish than other metals, and less liable to tarnish.
Metallic mirrors are alluded to by Job, xxxvii. 18. But it appears from the Second Book of
Moses, xxxviii. 8, that in that age, copper must have been the metal employed throughout the
harems of Palestine. For a general contribution of mirrors being made upon one occasion by
the Israelitish women, they were melted down and recast into washing vessels for the priestly
service. Now the sacred utensils, as we know from other sources, were undeniably of copper.
There is reason to think, however, that the copper was alloyed, according to the prevailing
practice in that age, with some proportions of lead or tin. In after ages, when silver was
chiefly employed, it gave place occasionally to gold. Mines of this metal were well known in
Palestine; but there is no evidence that precious stones, which were used for this purpose
in the ages of European luxury, were ever so used in Palestine, or in any part of Asia.

As to shape, the Hebrew mirrors were always either circular or oval, and cast indifferently
flat or concave. They were framed in superb settings, often of pearls and jewels; and, when
tarnished, were cleaned with a sponge of hyssop, the universal cleansing material in Palestine.

SCENE THE THIRD.

HEAD-DRESSES.

The head-dresses of the Hebrew ladies may be brought under three principal classes:--

The first was a NET-WORK CAP, made of fine wool or cotton, and worked with purple or crimson
flowers. Sometimes the meshes of the net were of gold thread. The rim or border of the cap,
generally of variegated coloring, was often studded with jewellery or pearls; and at the back
was ornamented with a bow, having a few ends or tassels flying loose.

Secondly, a TURBAN, managed in the following way: first of all, one or more caps in the form
of a half oval, such are still to be seen upon the monuments of Egyptian and Persepolitan art,
was fastened round the head by a ribbon or fillet tied behind. This cap was of linen, sometimes,
perhaps, of cotton, and in the inferior ranks of leather, or, according to the prevailing fashion,
of some kind of metal; and, in any case, it had ornaments worked into its substance. Round
this white or glittering ground were carried, in snaky windings, ribbons of the finest tiffany,
or of lawn resembling our cambric; and to conceal the joinings, a silky substance was carried
in folds, which pursued the opposite direction, and crossed the tiffany at right angles. For
the purpose of calling out and relieving the dazzling whiteness of the ground, colors of the
most brilliant class were chosen for the ribbons; and these ribbons were either embroidered
with flowers, in gold thread, or had ornaments of that description interwoven with their texture.

Thirdly, the HELMET, adorned pretty nearly as the turban; and, in imitation of the helmets
worn by Chaldean generals, having long tails, or tassels, depending from the hinder part, and
flowing loosely between the shoulders. According to the Oriental taste for perfumes, all the
ribbons or fillets used in these helmets and turbans were previously steeped in perfumes. Finally,
in connection with the turban, and often with the veil, was a beautiful ornament for the forehead
and the face, which the ladies of this day would do well to recall. Round the brow ran a brandeau
or tiara of gold or silver, three fingers' breadth, and usually set with jewels or pearls;
from this, at each of the temples, depended a chain of pearls or of coral, which, following
the margin of the cheeks, either hung loose or united below the chin.

SCENE THE FOURTH.

I. The reader has been already made acquainted with the chemise, or innermost under-dress.
The Hebrew ladies, however, usually wore two under-dresses, the upper of which it now remains
to describe. In substance it was generally of a fine transparent texture, like the muslins
(if we may so call them) of Cos; in the later ages it was no doubt of silk.

The chemise sate up close to the throat; and we have already mentioned the elaborate work which
adorned it about the opening. But the opening of the robe which we are now describing, was
of much larger compass--being cut down to the bosom; and the embroidery, &c. which enriched
it, was still more magnificent. The chemise reached down only to the calf of the leg, and the
sleeve of it to the elbow; but the upper chemise or tunic, if we may so call it, descended
in ample draperies to the feet--scarcely allowing the point of the foot to discover itself;
and the sleeves enveloped the hands to their middle. Great pomp was lavished on the folds of
the sleeves; but still greater on the hem of the robe, and the fringe attached to it. The hem
was formed by a broad border of purple, shaded and relieved according to patterns; and sometimes
embroidered in gold thread with the most elegant objects from the animal or vegetable kingdoms.
To that part which fell immediately behind the heels, there were attached thin plates of gold;
or, by way of variety, it was studded with golden stars and filigree-work; sometimes with jewels
and pearls interchangeably.

II. On this upper tunic, to confine the exorbitance of its draperies, and to prevent their
interfering with the free motions of the limbs, a superb GIRDLE was bound about the hips. Here,
if anywhere, the Hebrew ladies endeavored to pour out the whole pomp of their splendor--both
as to materials and workmanship. Belts from three to four inches broad, of the most delicate
cottony substance, were chosen as the ground of this important part of female attire. The finest
flowers of Palestine were here exhibited in rich relief, and in their native colors, either
woven in the loom, or by the needle of the embroiderer. The belts being thirty or forty feet
long, and carried round and round the person, it was in the power of the wearer to exhibit
an infinite variety of forms, by allowing any fold or number of folds at pleasure to rise up
more or less to view, just as fans or the colored edges of books with us are made to exhibit
landscapes, &c. capable of great varieties of expansion as they are more or less unfolded.
The fastening was by a knot below the bosom; and the two ends descended below the fringe; which,
if not the only fashion in use, was, however, the prevailing one--as we learn both from the
sculptures at Persepolis, and from the costume of the High Priest.

Great as the cost was of these girdles, it would have been far greater had the knot been exchanged
for a clasp; and in fact at a later period when this fashion did really take place, there was
no limit to the profusion with which pearls of the largest size and jewellery were accumulated
upon this conspicuous centre of the dress. Latterly the girdles were fitted up with beautiful
chains, by means of which they could be contracted or enlarged, and with gold buckles, and
large bosses and clasps that gradually became the basis for a ruinous display of expenditure.

In conclusion, I must remark, that in Palestine, as elsewhere, the girdle was sometimes used
as a purse: whether it were that the girdle itself was made hollow (as is expressly affirmed
of the High Priest's girdle), or that, without being hollow, its numerous foldings afforded
a secure depository for articles of small size. Even in our day, it is the custom to conceal
the dagger, the handkerchief for wiping the face, and other bagatelles of personal convenience,
in the folds of the girdle. However, the richer and more distinguished classes in Palestine
appear to have had a peculiar and separate article of that kind. And this was,

III. A PURSE made either of metal (usually gold or silver), or of the softest leather, &c.
which was attached by a lace to the girdle, or kept amongst its folds, and which, even in the
eyes of Isaiah, was important enough to merit a distinct mention. It was of a conical shape;
and at the broader end was usually enriched with ornaments of the most elaborate and exquisite
workmanship. No long time after the Christian era, the cost of these purses had risen to such
a height, that Tertullian complains, with great displeasure, of the ladies of his time, that
in the mere purse, apart from its contents, they carried about with them the price of a considerable
estate.

The girdle, however, still continued to be the appropriate depository for the napkin (to use
the old English word), or suclatory--i. e. handkerchief for clearing the forehead of perspiration.
As to pocket-handkerchiefs, in our northern use of them, it has been satisfactorily shown by
Bottiger, in a German Journal, that the Greek and Roman ladies knew nothing of that modern
appendage to the pocket, [Footnote 8] however indispensable it may appear to us; and the same
argument apply with equal force to the climate of Palestine.

IV. The glittering RINGS, with which (according to Isaiah, iii. 21), the Hebrew ladies adorned
their hands, seem to me originally to have been derived from the seal-rings, which, whether
suspended from the neck, or worn upon the finger, have in all ages been the most favorite ornament
of Asiatics. These splendid baubles were naturally in the highest degree attractive to women,
both from the beauty of the stones, which were usually selected for this purpose, and from
the richness of the setting--to say nothing of the exquisite art which the ancient lapidaries
displayed in cutting them. The stones chiefly valued by the ladies of Palestine, were rubies--emeralds--and
chrysolithes; and these, set in gold, sparkled on the middle, or little finger of the right
hand; and in the luxurious times upon all the fingers--even the thumb; nay, in some cases,
upon the great toe.

SCENE THE FIFTH.

UPPER GARMENT.

The upper or outer garments, which, for both sexes under all varieties and modifications, the
Hebrews expressed by the comprehensive denomination of SIMLAH, have hi every age, and through
all parts of the hot climates, in Asia and Africa alike, been of such voluminous compass--as
not only to envelop the whole person, but to be fitted for a wide range of miscellaneous purposes.
Sometimes (as in the triumphal entry of Christ into Jerusalem) they were used as carpets; sometimes
as coverings for the backs of camels, horses, or asses, to render the rider's seat less incommodious;
sometimes as a bed coverlid, or counterpane; at other times as sacks for carrying articles
of value; or finally as curtains, hangings of parlors, occasionally tapestry, or even as sails
for boats.

From these illustrations of the uses to which it was applicable, we may collect the form of
this robe: that it was nothing more than a shawl of large dimensions, or long square of cloth,
just as it came from the weaver's loom, which was immediately thrown round the person, without
receiving any artificial adjustment to the human shape.

So much for the form: with regard to the material, there was less uniformity; originally it
was of goats' or camels' hair; but, as civilization and the luxury of cities increased, these
coarse substances were rejected for the finest wool, and Indian cotton. Indeed, through all
antiquity, we find, that pure unsullied white was the festal color, and more especially in
Palestine, where the indigenous soaps, and other cleaning materials, gave them peculiar advantages
for adopting a dress of that delicate and perishable lustre.

With the advance of luxury, however, came a love of variety; and this, added to the desire
for more stimulating impressions than could be derived from blank unadorned white, gradually
introduced all sorts of innovations, both in form and color; though, with respect to the first,
amidst all the changes through which it travelled, the old original outline still manifestly
predominated. An account of the leading varieties, we find in the celebrated third chapter
of Isaiah.

The most opulent women of Palestine, beyond all other colors for the upper robe, preferred
purple--or, if not purple throughout the entire robe, at any rate purple flowers upon a white
ground. The winter clothing of the very richest families in Palestine, was manufactured in
their own houses; and for winter clothing, more especially, the Hebrew taste, no less than
the Grecian and the Roman, preferred the warm and sunny scarlet, the puce color, the violet,
and the regal purple. [Footnote 9]

Very probable it is, that the Hebrew ladies, like those of Greece, were no strangers to the
half-mantle--fastened by a clasp in front of each shoulder, and suffered to flow in free draperies
down the back; this was an occasional and supernumerary garment flung over the regular upper
robe--properly so called.

There was also a longer mantle, reaching to the ankles, usually of a violet color, which--having
no sleeves--was meant to expose to view the beauty not only of the upper robe, but even of
the outer tunic formerly described. By the way, it should be mentioned, that, in order to steep
them in fine odor, all parts of the wardrobe were stretched on a reticulated or grated vessel--called
by the Thalmud (vi. 77) Kanklin--from which the steams of rich perfumes were made to ascend.

In what way the upper robe was worn and fastened, may be collected perhaps with sufficient
probability from the modern Oriental practice, as described by travellers; but, as we have
no direct authority on the subject, I shall not detain the reader with any conjectural speculations.

SCENE THE SIXTH.

DRESS OF CEREMONY.

One magnificent dress remains yet to be mentioned, viz. the dress of honor, or festival dress--which
answers in every respect to the modern CAFTAN. This was used on all occasions of ceremony,
as splendid weddings, presentations at the courts of kings, sumptuous entertainments, &c.;
and all persons who stood in close connection with the throne, as favorites, crown-officers,
distinguished military commanders, &c., received such a dress as a gift from the royal treasury,
in order to prepare them at all times for the royal presence. According to the universal custom
of Asia, the trains were proportioned in length to the rank of the wearer; whence it is that
the robes of the high-priest were adorned with a train of superb dimensions; and even Jehovah
is represented, (Isaiah, vi. 1,) as filling the heavenly palace with the length of his train,
[Footnote 10] Another distinction of this festival robe, was the ordinary fulness and length
of the sleeves; these descended to the knee, and often ran to the ankle or to the ground. In
the sleeves, and in the trains, but especially in the latter, lay the chief pride of a Hebrew
belle, when dressed for any great solemnity or occasion of public display.

NOTES.

NOTE 1. It is one great advantage to the illustrator of ancient costume, that when almost everything
in this sort of usages was fixed and determined either by religion and state policy, (as with
the Jews,) or by state policy alone, (as with the Romans,) or by superstition and by settled
climate, (as with both,) and when there was no stimulation to vanity in the love of change
from an inventive condition of art and manufacturing skill, and where the system and interests
of the government relied for no part of its power on such a condition,--dress was stationary
for ages, both as to materials and fashion; Rebecca, the Bedouin, was drest pretty nearly as
Mariamne in the age of the Caesars. And thus the labors of a learned investigator for one age
are valid for those which follow and precede.

NOTE 2. Chiton (*) in Greek, and by inversion of the syllables, Tunica in Latin.

NOTE 3. Cheaper materials were used by the poorer Hebrews, especially of the Bedouin tribes--burnt
almonds, lamp-black, soot, the ashes of particular woods, the gall-apple boiled and pulverized,
or any dark powder made into an unguent by suitable liquors. The modern Grecian women, in some
districts, as Sonnini tells us, use the spine of the sea-polypus, calcined and finely pulverized,
for this purpose. Boxes of horn were used for keeping the pigment by the poorer Hebrews,--of
onyx or alabaster by the richer.

NOTE 4.

Cleopatra had a couple of that value; and Julius Caesar had one, which he gave to Servilia,
the beautiful mother of Brutus.

NOTE 5.

Washing the feet was a ceremony of ancient times, adopted not merely with a view, 1st, to personal
comfort, in hotter climates; or, 2d, to decorum of appearance, where people walked about barefooted;
but also, 3d, to the reclining posture in use at meals, which necessarily brought the feet
into immediate contact with the cushions, squabs, &c. of couches.

NOTE 6.

Chemistry had its first origin in Arabia; and it is not impossible that the chemical nomenclature
for gold and silver, viz. sol and luna, were derived from this early superstition of the Bedouin
dress.

NOTE 7.

The Thalmud is the only Jewish authority which mentions such a utensil of the toilette as a
comb, (vi. 39,) but without any particular description. Hartmann adds two remarks worth quoting.
1. That the Hebrew style of the coiffure may probably be collected from the Syrian coins; and,
2. That black hair being admired in Palestine, and the Jewish hair being naturally black, it
is probable that the Jewish ladies did not color their hair, as the Romans did.

NOTE 8.

Or rather it was required only in a catarrh, or other cases of checked perspiration, which
in those climates was not a case of common occurrence.

NOTE 9. By which was probably meant a color nearer to crimson, than to the blue class of purples.

NOTE 10. It has been doubted whether these trains were supported by train-bearers; but one
argument makes it probable that they were not, viz. that they were particularly favorable to
the peacock walk or strut, which was an express object of imitation in the gait of the Hebrew
women.

FINAL NOTES.

I. The Syndon, mentioned by Isaiah, &c. was a delicate and transparent substance, like our
tiffany, and in point of money value was fully on a level with the Caftan; but whether imported
from Egypt, or imitated in the looms of the Hebrews and Phoenicians, is doubtful. It was worn
next to the skin; and consequently, in the harems of the great, occupied the place of the under
tunic (or chemise) previously described; and, as luxury advanced, there is reason to think
that it was used as a night chemise.

II. The Caftan is the Kalaat of the East, so often mentioned by modern travellers; thus, for
example, Thevenot (tom. iii. p. 352) says--'Le Roi fait assez souvent des presens a ses Khans,
&c. L'on appelle ces presens Kalaat.' Chardin. (iii. 101,) 'On appelle Calaat les habits que
le Roi donne par honeur.' And lately in Lord Amherst's progress through the northern provinces
of our Indian empire, &c. we read continually of the Khelawt, or robe of state, as a present
made by the native princes to distinguished officers.

The Caftan, or festival robe of the Hebrews, was, in my opinion, the [Greek Text: Peaelos]
of the Greeks, or palla of the Romans. Among the points of resemblance are these:--

1. The palla was flung like a cloak or mantle, over the stola, or uppermost robe, 'Ad talos
stola demissa et circundata palla.'

2. The palla not only descended in flowing draperies to the feet, (thus Tibullus, I. VII. C.
'Fusa sed ad teneros lutea palla pedes,') but absolutely swept the ground; 'Verrit humum Tyrio
saturata murice palla.'

3. The palla was of the same wide compass, and equally distinguished for its splendor.

4. Like the Hebrew festival garment, the palla was a vestis seposita, and reserved for rare
solemnities.

With respect to the [Greek Text: Peplos], Eustathius describes it as [Greek Text: megan xai
peoixallea xai poixilon peobolaion]; and it would be easy in other respects to prove its identity
with the Palla.

Salmasius, by the way, in commenting upon Tertullian, de Pallio, is quite wrong, where he says--'Palla
nunquam de virili pallio dicitur.' Tibullus, tom. iii. iv. 35, sufficiently contradicts that
opinion.

MILTON.

[1839.]

We have two ideas, which we are anxious to bring under public notice, with regard to Milton.
The reader whom Providence shall send us will not measure the value of these ideas (we trust
and hope) by their bulk. The reader indeed--that great idea!--is very often a more important
person towards the fortune of an essay than the writer. Even 'the prosperity of a jest,' as
Shakespeare tells us, lies less in its own merit than 'in the ear of him that hears it.' If
he should happen to be unusually obtuse, the wittiest jest perishes--the most pointed is found
blunt. So, with regard to books, should the reader on whom we build prove a sandy and treacherous
foundation, the whole edifice, 'temple and tower,' must come to the ground. Should it happen,
for instance, that the reader, inflicted upon ourselves for our sins, belongs to that class
of people who listen to books in the ratio of their much speaking--find no eloquence in 32mo.,
and little force of argument except in such a folio as might knock him down upon occasion of
his proving restive against its logic--in that case he will despise our present essay. Will
despise it? He does despise it already: for already he sees that it is short. His contempt
is a high a priori contempt: for he measures us by anticipation, and needs to wait for no experience
in order to vindicate his sentence against us.

Yet, in one view, this brevity of an essayist does seem to warrant his reader in some little
indignation. We, the writer, expect to bring over the reader to our opinion--else wherefore
do we write? But, within so small a compass of ground, is it reasonable to look for such a
result? 'Bear witness to the presumption of this essay,' we hear the reader complaining: 'It
measures about fourteen inches by two--twenty-eight square inches at the most--and is it within
human belief that I, simply as I stand here, shall be converted in so narrow an area? Here
am I in a state of nature, as you may say. An acre of sound argument might do something: but
here is a man who flatters himself--that, before I am advanced seven inches further in my studies,
he is to work a notable change in my creed. By Castor and Pollux! he must think very superbly
of himself, or very meanly of me.'

Too true, we reply, too true; but, perhaps, there are faults on both sides. The writer is too
peremptory and exacting; the reader is too restive. The writer is too full of his office, which
he fancies is that of a teacher or a professor speaking ex cathedra: the rebellious reader
is oftentimes too determined that he will not learn. The one conceits himself booted and spurred,
and mounted on his reader's back, with an express commission for riding him: the other is vicious,
apt to bolt out of the course at every opening, and resolute in this point--that he will not
be ridden.

There are some, meantime, who take a very different view of the relations existing between
those well-known parties to a book--writer and reader. So far from regarding the writer as
entitled to the homage of his reader, as if he were some feudal superior, they hold him little
better than an actor bowing before the reader as his audience. The feudal relation of fealty
[fidelitas] may subsist between them, but the places are inverted; the writer is the liegeman--the
reader it is who claims to be the sovereign. Our own opinion inclines this way. It is clear
that the writer exists for the sake of the reader, not the reader for the sake of the writer.
Besides, the writer bears all sorts of characters, whilst the reader universally has credit
for the best possible. We have all heard of 'the courteous reader,' 'the candid reader,' 'the
enlightened reader.' But which of us ever heard of 'the discourteous reader,' 'the mulish reader,'
'the barbarous reader?' Doubtless there is no such person. The Goths and Vandals are all confined
to the writers. 'The reader'--that great character--is ever wise, ever learned, ever courteous.
Even in the worst of times, this great man preserved his purity. Even in the tenth and eleventh
centuries, which we usually account the very noontide of darkness, he shone like a mould candle
amongst basest dips. And perhaps it is our duty to presume all other virtues and graces as
no less essential to him than his glorious 'candor,' his 'courtesy,' (surpassing that of Sir
Gawain,) and his truly 'enlightened' understanding. Indeed, we very much question whether a
writer, who carries with him a just feeling of his allegiance--a truly loyal writer--can lawfully
suppose his sovereign, the reader, peccable or capable of error; and whether there is not even
a shade of impiety in conceiving him liable to the affections of sleep, or of yawning.

Having thus, upon our knees as it were, done feudal homage to our great suzerain, the reader--having
propitiated him with Persian adorations and with Phrygian genuflexions, let us now crave leave
to convert him a little. Convert him!--that sounds 'un pen fort,' does it not? No, not at all.
A cat may look at a king; and upon this or that out-of-the-way point a writer may presume to
be more knowing than his reader--the serf may undertake to convert his lord. The reader is
a great being--a great noun-substantive; but still, like a mere adjective, he is liable to
the three degrees of comparison. He may rise above himself--he may transcend the ordinary level
of readers, however exalted that level be. Being great, he may become greater. Full of light,
he may yet labor with a spot or two of darkness. And such a spot we hold the prevalent opinion
upon Milton in two particular questions of taste--questions that are not insulated, but diffusive;
spreading themselves over the entire surface of the Paradise Lost, and also of the Paradise
Regained; insomuch that, if Milton is wrong once, then he is wrong by many scores of times.
Nay, which transcends all counting of cases or numerical estimates of error, if, in the separate
instances, (be they few or be they many,) he is truly and indeed wrong--then he has erred,
not by the case but by the principle; and that is a thousand times worse; for a separate case
or instance of error may escape any man--may have been overlooked amongst the press of objects
crowding on his eye; or, if not overlooked, if passed deliberately, may plead the ordinary
privilege of human frailty. The man erred; and his error terminates in itself. But an error
of principle does not terminate in itself; it is a fountain; it is self-diffusive; and it has
a life of its own. The faults of a great man are in any case contagious; they are dazzling
and delusive by means of the great man's general example. But his false principles have a worse
contagion. They operate not only through the general haze and halo which invests a shining
example; but even if transplanted where that example is unknown, they propagate themselves
by the vitality inherent in all self-consistent principles, whether true or false.

Before we notice these two cases of Milton, first of all let us ask--Who and what is Milton?
Dr. Johnson was furiously incensed with a certain man, by trade an author and manufacturer
of books wholesale and retail, for introducing Milton's name into a certain index thus--'Milton,
Mr. John.' That Mister, undoubtedly, was hard to digest. Yet very often it happens to the best
of us--to men who are far enough from 'thinking small beer of themselves,'--that about ten
o'clock, A. M., an official big-wig, sitting at Bow Street, calls upon the man to account for
his sprees of the last night, for his feats in knocking down lamp-posts and extinguishing watchmen,
by this ugly demand of--'Who and what are you, sir?' And perhaps the poor man, sick and penitential
for want of soda water, really finds a considerable difficulty in replying satisfactorily to
the worthy beek's apostrophe. Although, at five o'clock in the evening, should the culprit
be returning into the country in the same coach as his awful interrogator, he might be very
apt to look fierce, and retort this amiable inquiry, and with equal thirst for knowledge to
demand, 'D--your eyes, if you come to that, who and what are you?' And the beek in his turn,
though so apt to indulge his own curiosity at the expense of the public, might find it very
difficult to satisfy that of others.

The same thing happens to authors; and to great authors beyond all others. So accustomed are
we to survey a great man through the cloud of years that has gathered round him--so impossible
is it to detach him from the pomp and equipage of all who have quoted him, copied him, echoed
him, lectured about him, disputed about him, quarrelled about him, that in the case of any
Anacharsis the Scythian coming amongst us--any savage, that is to say, uninstructed in our
literature, but speaking our language, and feeling an interest in our great men--a man could
hardly believe at first how perplexed he would feel--how utterly at a loss for any adequate
answer to this question, suddenly proposed-'Who and what was Milton?' That is to say, what
is the place which he fills in his own vernacular literature? what station does he hold in
universal literature?

We, if abruptly called upon in that summary fashion to convey a commensurate idea of Milton,
one which might at once correspond to his pretensions, and yet be readily intelligible to the
savage, should answer perhaps thus:--Milton is not an author amongst authors, not a poet amongst
poets, but a power amongst powers; and the Paradise Lost is not a book amongst books, not a
poem amongst poems, but a central force amongst forces. Let us explain. There is this great
distinction amongst books; some, though possibly the best in their class, are still no more
than books--not indispensable, not incapable of supplementary representation by other books.
If they had never been--if their place had continued for ages unfilled--not the less, upon
a sufficient excitement arising, there would always have been found the ability, either directly
to fill up the vacancy, or at least to meet the same passion virtually, though by a work differing
in form. Thus, supposing Butler to have died in youth, and the Hudibras to have been intercepted
by his premature death, still the ludicrous aspects of the Parliamentary war, and its fighting
saints, were too striking to have perished. If not in a narrative form, the case would have
come forward in the drama. Puritanical sanctity, in collision with the ordinary interests of
life, and with its militant propensities, offered too striking a field for the Satiric Muse,
in any case, to have passed in total neglect. The impulse was too strong for repression--it
was a volcanic agency, that, by some opening or, other, must have worked a way for itself to
the upper air. Yet Butler was a most original poet, and a creator within his own province.
But, like many another original mind, there is little doubt that he quelled and repressed,
by his own excellence, other minds of the same cast. Mere despair of excelling him, so far
as not, after all, to seem imitators, drove back others who would have pressed into that arena,
if not already brilliantly filled. Butler failing, there would have been another Butler, either
in the same or in some analogous form.

But, with regard to Milton and the Miltonic power, the case is far otherwise. If the man had
failed, the power would have failed. In that mode of power which he wielded, the function was
exhausted in the man--species was identified with the individual--the poetry was incarnated
in the poet.

Let it be remembered, that, of all powers which act upon man through his intellectual nature,
the very rarest is that which we moderns call the Sublime. The Grecians had apparently no word
for it, unless it were that which they meant by [Greek Text: to ogchodes]: for [Greek Text:
upsos] was a comprehensive expression for all qualities which gave a character of grace or
animation to the composition, such even as were philosophically opposed to the sublime. In
the Roman poetry, and especially in Lucan, at times also Juvenal, there is an exhibition of
a moral sublime, perfectly distinct from anything known to the Greek poetry. The delineations
of republican grandeur, as expressing itself through the principal leaders in the Roman camps,
or the trampling under foot of ordinary superstitions, as given in the reasons assigned to
Labienus for passing the oracle of the Lybian Jupiter unconsulted, are in a style to which
there is nothing corresponding in the whole Grecian literature, nor would they have been comprehensible
to an Athenian. The famous line--'Jupiter est quodcunque vides, quodcunque moveris,' and the
brief review of such questions as might be worthy of an oracular god, with the summary declaration,
that every one of those points we know already by the light of nature, and could not know them
better though Jupiter Ammon himself were to impress them on our attention--

'Scimus, et haec nobis non altius inseret Ammon:' all this is truly Roman in its sublimity;
and so exclusively Roman, that there, and not in poets like the Augustan, expressly modelling
their poems on Grecian types, ought the Roman mind to be studied.

On the other hand, for that species of the sublime which does not rest purely and merely on
moral energies, but on a synthesis between man and nature--for what may properly be called
the Ethico-physical Sublime--there is but one great model surviving in the Greek poetry, viz.
the gigantic drama of the Prometheus crucified on Mount Elborus. And this drama differs so
much from everything else, even in the poetry of Aeschylus, as the mythus itself differs so
much from all the rest of the Grecian mythology, (belonging apparently to an age and a people
more gloomy, austere, and nearer to the incunabula mundi, than those which bred the gay and
sunny superstitions of Greece,) that much curiosity and speculation have naturally gathered
round the subject of late years. Laying this one insulated case apart, and considering that
the Hebrew poetry of Isaiah and Ezekiel, as having the benefit of inspiration, does not lie
within the just limits of competition, we may affirm that there is no human composition which
can be challenged as constitutionally sublime--sublime equally by its conception and by its
execution, or as uniformly sublime from first to last, excepting the Paradise Lost. In Milton
only, first and last, is the power of the sublime revealed. In Milton only does this great
agency blaze and glow as a furnace kept up to a white heat--without intermission and without
collapse.

If, therefore, Milton occupies this unique position--and let the reader question himself closely
whether he can cite any other book than the Paradise Lost, as continuously sublime, or sublime
even by its prevailing character--in that case there is a peculiarity of importance investing
that one book which belongs to no other; and it must be important to dissipate any erroneous
notions which affect the integrity of that book's estimation. Now, there are two notions countenanced
by Addison and by Dr. Johnson, which tend greatly to disparage the character of its composition.
If the two critics, one friendly, the other very malignant, but both meaning to be just, have
in reality built upon sound principles, or at least upon a sound appreciation of Milton's principles--in
that case there is a mortal taint diffused over the whole of the Paradise Lost: for not a single
book is clear of one or other of the two errors which they charge upon him. We will briefly
state the objections, and then as briefly reply to them, by exposing the true philosophy of
Milton's practice. For we are very sure that, in doing as he did, this mighty poet was governed
by no carelessness or oversight, (as is imagined,) but by a most refined theory of poetic effects.

I. The first of these two charges respects a supposed pedantry, or too ambitious a display
of erudition. It is surprising to us that such an objection should have occurred to any man;
both because, after all, the quantity of learning cannot be great for which any poem can find
an opening; and because, in any poem burning with concentrated fire, like the Miltonic, the
passion becomes a law to itself, and will not receive into connection with itself any parts
so deficient in harmony, as a cold ostentation of learned illustrations must always have been
found. Still, it is alleged that such words as frieze, architrave, cornice, zenith, &c., are
words of art, out of place amongst the primitive simplicities of Paradise, and at war with
Milton's purpose of exhibiting the Paradisaical state.

Now, here is displayed broadly the very perfection of ignorance, as measured against the very
perfection of what may be called poetic science. We will lay open the true purpose of Milton,
by a single illustration. In describing impressive scenery, as occurring in a hilly or a woody
country, everybody must have noticed the habit which young ladies have of using the word amphitheatre:
'amphitheatre of woods'--'amphitheatre of hills,'--these are their constant expressions. Why?
Is it because the word amphitheatre is a Grecian word? We question if one young lady in twenty
knows that it is; and very certain we are that no word would recommend itself to her use by
that origin, if she happened to be aware of it. The reason lurks here:--In the word theatre,
is contained an evanescent image of a great audience--of a populous multitude. Now, this image--half
withdrawn, half-flashed upon the eye--and combined with the word hills or forests, is thrown
into powerful collision with the silence of hills--with the solitude of forests; each image,
from reciprocal contradiction, brightens and vivifies the other. The two images act, and react,
by strong repulsion and antagonism.

This principle we might exemplify, and explain at great length; but we impose a law of severe
brevity upon ourselves. And we have said enough. Out of this one principle of subtle and lurking
antagonism, may be explained everything which has been denounced under the idea of pedantry
in Milton. It is the key to all that lavish pomp of art and knowledge which is sometimes put
forward by Milton in situations of intense solitude, and in the bosom of primitive nature--as,
for example, in the Eden of his great poem, and in the Wilderness of his Paradise Regained.
The shadowy exhibition of a regal banquet in the desert, draws out and stimulates the sense
of its utter solitude and remotion from men or cities. The images of architectural splendor,
suddenly raised in the very centre of Paradise, as vanishing shows by the wand of a magician,
bring into powerful relief the depth of silence, and the unpopulous solitude which possess
this sanctuary of man whilst yet happy and innocent. Paradise could not, in any other way,
or by any artifice less profound, have been made to give up its essential and differential
characteristics in a form palpable to the imagination. As a place of rest, it was necessary
that it should be placed in close collision with the unresting strife of cities; as a place
of solitude, with the image of tumultuous crowds; as the centre of mere natural beauty in its
gorgeous prime, with the images of elaborate architecture and of human workmanship; as a place
of perfect innocence in seclusion, that it should be exhibited as the antagonist pole to the
sin and misery of social man.

Such is the covert philosophy which governs Milton's practice, and which might be illustrated
by many scores of passages from both the Paradise Lost and the Paradise Regained. [Footnote:
For instance, this is the key to that image in the Paradise Regained, where Satan, on first
emerging into sight, is compared to an old man gathering sticks 'to warm him on a winter's
day.' This image, at first sight, seems little in harmony with the wild and awful character
of the supreme fiend. No: it is not in harmony; nor is it meant to be in harmony. On the contrary,
it is meant to be in antagonism and intense repulsion. The household image of old age, of human
infirmity, and of domestic hearths, are all meant as a machinery for provoking and soliciting
the fearful idea to which they are placed in collision, and as so many repelling poles.] In
fact, a volume might be composed on this one chapter. And yet, from the blindness or inconsiderate
examination of his critics, this latent wisdom--this cryptical science of poetic effects--in
the mighty poet, has been misinterpreted, and set down to the account of defective skill, or
even of puerile ostentation.

II. The second great charge against Milton is, prima facie, even more difficult to meet. It
is the charge of having blended the Pagan and Christian forms. The great realities of angels
and archangels are continually combined into the same groups with the fabulous impersonations
of the Greek mythology. Eve is interlinked in comparisons with Pandora; sometimes again with
Eurynome. Those impersonations, however, may be thought to have something of allegoric meaning
in their conceptions, which in a measure corrects this Paganism of the idea. But Eve is also
compared with Ceres, with Hebe, and other fixed forms of Pagan superstition. Other allusions
to the Greek mythologic forms, or direct combination of them with the real existences of the
Christian heavens, might be produced by scores, were it not that we decline to swell our paper
beyond the necessity of the case. Now, surely this at least is an error. Can there be any answer
to this?

At one time we were ourselves inclined to fear that Milton had been here caught tripping. In
this instance, at least, he seems to be in error. But there is no trusting to appearances.
In meditating upon the question, we happened to remember that the most colossal and Miltonic
of painters had fallen into the very same fault, if fault it were. In his Last Judgment, Michael
Angelo has introduced the Pagan deities in connection with the hierarchy of the Christian heavens.
Now, it is very true that one great man cannot palliate the error of another great man, by
committing the same error himself. But, though it cannot avail as an excuse, such a conformity
of ideas serves as a summons to a much more vigilant examination of the case than might else
be instituted. One man might err from inadvertency; but that two, and both men trained to habits
of constant meditation, should fall into the same error--makes the marvel tenfold greater.

Now we confess that, as to Michael Angelo, we do not pretend to assign the precise key to the
practice which he adopted. And to our feelings, after all that might be said in apology, there
still remains an impression of incongruity in the visual exhibition and direct juxtaposition
of the two orders of supernatural existence so potently repelling each other. But, as regards
Milton, the justification is complete; it rests upon the following principle: In all other
parts of Christianity, the two orders of superior beings, the Christian heaven and the Pagan
pantheon, are felt to be incongruous--not as the pure opposed to the impure, (for, if that
were the reason, then the Christian fiends should be incongruous with the angels, which they
are not,)--but as the unreal opposed to the real. In all the hands of other poets, we feel
that Jupiter, Mercury, Apollo, Diana, are not merely impure conceptions, but that they are
baseless conceptions, phantoms of air, nonentities; and there is much the same objection, in
point of just taste, to the combination of such fabulous beings in the same groups with glorified
saints and angels, as there is to the combination, by a painter or a sculptor, of real flesh-and-blood
creatures with allegoric abstractions.

This is the objection to such combination in all other poets. But this objection does not apply
to Milton: it glances past him; and for the following reason: Milton has himself laid an early
foundation for his introduction of the Pagan pantheon into Christian groups:--the false gods
of the heathen world were, according to Milton, the fallen angels. They are not false, therefore,
in the sense of being unreal, baseless, and having a merely fantastical existence, like our
European fairies, but as having drawn aside mankind from a pure worship. As ruined angels under
other names, they are no less real than the faithful and loyal angels of the Christian heavens.
And in that one difference of the Miltonic creed, which the poet has brought pointedly and
elaborately under his reader's notice by his matchless catalogue of the rebellious angels,
and of their Pagan transformations in the very first book of the Paradise Lost, is laid beforehand
the amplest foundation for his subsequent practice; and at the same time, therefore, the amplest
answer to the charge preferred against him by Dr. Johnson, and by so many other critics, who
had not sufficiently penetrated the latent theory on which he acted.

CHARLEMAGNE.

[FOOTNOTE: The History of Charlemagne; with a Sketch, and History of France from the Fall of
the Roman Empire to the Rise of the Carlovingian Dynasty. By G.P.R. JAMES, Esq. VOL. II.]

[1832.]

History is sometimes treated under the splendid conception of 'philosophy teaching by example,'
and sometimes as an 'old almanac;' and, agreeably to this latter estimate, we once heard a
celebrated living professor of medicine, who has been since distinguished by royal favor, and
honored with a title, making it his boast, that he had never charged his memory with one single
historical fact; that, on the contrary, he had, out of profound contempt for a sort of knowledge
so utterly without value in his eyes, anxiously sought to extirpate from his remembrance,--or,
if that were impossible, to perplex and confound,--any relics of historical records which might
happen to survive from his youthful studies. 'And I am happy to say,' added he, 'and it is
consoling to have it in my power conscientiously to declare, that, although I have not been
able to dismiss entirely from my mind some ridiculous fact about a succession of four great
monarchies, (for human infirmity still clings to our best efforts, and will forever prevent
our attaining perfection,) still I have happily succeeded in so far confounding all distinctions
of things and persons, of time and of places, that I could not assign the era of any one transaction,
as I humbly trust, within a thousand years. The whole vast series of history is become a wilderness
to me; and my mind, as to all such absurd knowledge, under the blessing of Heaven, is pretty
nearly a tabula rasa.' In this Gothic expression of self-congratulation upon the extent of
his own ignorance, though doubtless founded upon what the Germans call an einseitig or one-sided
estimate, there was however that sort of truth which is apprehended only by strong minds, and
such as naturally adhere to extreme courses. Certainly the blank knowledge of facts, which
is all that most readers gather from their historical studies, is a mere deposition of rubbish
without cohesion, and resting upon no basis of theory (that is, of general comprehensive survey)
applied to the political development of nations, and accounting for the great stages of their
internal movements. Rightly and profitably to understand history, it ought to be studied in
as many ways as it may be written. History, as a composition, falls into three separate arrangements,
obeying three distinct laws, and addressing itself to three distinct objects. Its first and
humblest office is to deliver a naked unadorned exposition of public events and their circumstances.
This form of history may be styled the purely Narrative; the second form is that which may
be styled the Scenical; and the third the Philosophic. What is meant by Philosophic History,
is well understood in our present advanced state of society; and few histories are written
except in the simplest condition of human culture, which do not in part assume its functions,
or which are content to rest their entire attraction upon the abstract interest of facts. The
privileges of this form have, however, been greatly abused; and the truth of facts has been
so much forced to bend before preconceived theories, whereas every valid theory ought to be
abstracted from the facts, that Mr. Southey and others in this day have set themselves to decry
the whole genus and class--as essentially at war with the very primary purposes of the art.
But, under whatever name, it is evident that philosophy, or an investigation of the true moving
forces in every great train and sequence of national events, and an exhibition of the motives
and the moral consequences in their largest extent which have concurred with these events,
cannot be omitted in any history above the level of a childish understanding. Mr. Southey himself
will be found to illustrate this necessity by his practice, whilst assailing it in principle.
As to the other mode of history--history treated scenically, it is upon the whole the most
delightful to the reader, and the most susceptible of art and ornament in the hands of a skilful
composer. The most celebrated specimen in this department is the Decline and Fall of Gibbon.
And to this class may in part [Footnote 1] be referred the Historical Sketches of Voltaire.
Histories of this class proceed upon principles of selection, presupposing in the reader a
general knowledge of the great cardinal incidents, and bringing forward into especial notice
those only which are susceptible of being treated with distinguished effect.

These are the three separate modes of treating history; each has its distinct purposes; and
all must contribute to make up a comprehensive total of historical knowledge. The first furnishes
the facts; the second opens a thousand opportunities for pictures of manners and national temper
in every stage of their growth; whilst the third abstracts the political or the ethical moral,
and unfolds the philosophy which knits the history of one nation to that of others, and exhibits
the whole under their internal connection, as parts of one great process, carrying on the great
economy of human improvement by many stages in many regions at one and the same time.

Pursued upon this comprehensive scale, the study of history is the study of human nature. But
some have continued to reject it, not upon any objection to the quality of the knowledge gained--but
simply on the ground of its limited extent; contending that in public and political transactions,
such as compose the matter of history, human nature exhibits itself upon too narrow a scale
and under too monotonous an aspect; that under different names, and in connection with different
dates and regions, events virtually the same are continually revolving; that whatever novelty
may strike the ear, in passages of history taken from periods widely remote, affects the names
only, and circumstances that are extra-essential; that the passions meantime, the motives,
and (allowing for difference of manners) the means even, are subject to no variety; that in
ancient or in modern history there is no real accession made to our knowledge of human nature:
but that all proceeds by cycles of endless repetition; and in fact that, according to the old
complaint, 'there is nothing new under the sun.' It is not true that 'there is nothing new
under the sun,' This is the complaint, as all men know, of a jaded voluptuary, seeking for
a new pleasure and finding none, for reasons which lay in his own vitiated nature. Why did
he seek for novelty? Because old pleasures had ceased to stimulate his exhausted organs; and
that was reason enough why no new pleasure, had any been found, would operate as such for him.
The weariness of spirit, and the poverty of pleasure which he bemoaned as belonging to our
human condition, were not in reality objective, (as a German philosopher would express himself,)
or laid in the nature of things, and thus pressing upon all alike, but subjective, that is
to say, derived from the peculiar state and affections of his own organs for apprehending pleasure.
Not the apprehensibile, but the apprehendens, was in fault--not the pleasures, or the dewy
freshness of pleasures, had decayed, but the sensibilities of him who thus undertook to appraise
them.

More truly, and more philosophically, it may be said that there is nothing old under the sun,
no absolute repetition. It is the well-known doctrine of Leibnitz, [Footnote 2] that amongst
the familiar objects of our daily experience, there is no perfect identity. All in external
nature proceeds by endless variety. Infinite change, illimitable novelty, inexhaustible difference,
these are the foundations upon which nature builds and ratifies her purpose of individuality--so
indispensable, amongst a thousand other great uses, to the very elements of social distinctions
and social rights, But for the endless circumstances of difference which characterize external
objects, the rights of property, for instance, would have stood upon no certain basis, nor
admitted of any general or comprehensive guarantee.

As with external objects, so with human actions; amidst their infinite approximations and affinities,
they are separated by circumstances of never-ending diversity. History may furnish her striking
correspondences, Biography her splendid parallels, Rome may in certain cases appear but the
mirror of Athens, England of Rome,--and yet, after all, no character can be cited, no great
transaction, no revolution of 'high-viced cities,' no catastrophe of nations, which, in the
midst of its resemblances to distant correspondences in other ages, docs not include features
of abundant distinction and individualizing characteristics, so many and so important, as to
yield its own peculiar matter for philosophical meditation and its own separate moral. Rare
is the case in history, or (to speak with suitable boldness) there is none, which does not
involve circumstances capable to a learned eye, without any external aid from chronology, of
referring it to its own age. The doctrine of Leibnitz, on the grounds of individuality in the
objects of sense, may, in fact, be profitably extended to all the great political actions of
mankind. Many pass, in a popular sense, for pure transcripts or duplicates of similar cases
in past times; but, accurately speaking, none are such truly and substantially. Neither are
the differences, by which they are severally marked and featured, interesting only to the curiosity
or to the spirit of minute research. All public acts in the degree in which they are great
and comprehensive, are steeped in living feelings, and saturated with the spirit of their own
age; and the features of their individuality, that is, the circumstances which chiefly distinguish
them from their nearest parallels in other times, and chiefly prevent them from lapsing into
blank repetitions of the same identical case, are generally the very cardinal points, the organs,
and the depositories which lodge whatever best expresses the temper and tendencies of the age
to which they belong. So far are these special points of distinction from being slight or trivial,
that in them par excellence is gathered and concentrated, whatever a political philosopher
would be best pleased to insulate and to converge within his field of view.

This, indeed, is evident upon consideration; and is in some sense implied in the very verbal
enunciation of the proposition; vi termini, it should strike every man who reflects--that in
great national transactions of different ages, so far resembling each other as to merit the
description of parallels, all the circumstances of agreement--all those which compose the resemblance
for the very reason that they are common to both periods of time, specially and characteristically
belong to neither. It is the differential, and not the common--the points of special dissimilitude,
not those of general similitude--which manifestly must be looked to, for the philosophic valuation
of the times or the people--for the adjudication of their peculiar claims in a comparison with
other times and other people--and for the appraisement of the progress made, whether positively
for its total amount, or relatively to itself, for its rate of advance at each separate stage.

It is in this way of critical examination, that comparison and the collation of apparent parallels,
from being a pure amusement of ingenuity, rises to a philosophic labor, and that the study
of History becomes at once dignified and in a most practical sense profitable. It is the opinion
of the subtlest and the most combining (if not the most useful) philosopher whom England has
produced, that a true knowledge of history confers the gift of prophecy; or that intelligently
and sagaciously to have looked backwards, is potentially to have looked forwards. For example,
he is of opinion that any student of the great English civil war in the reign of Charles I.,
who should duly have noted the signs precurrent and concurrent of those days, and should also
have read the contemporary political pamphlets, coming thus prepared, could not have failed,
after a corresponding study of the French literature from 1750 to 1788, and in particular,
after collecting the general sense and temper of the French people from the Cahiers, (or codes
of instruction transmitted by the electoral bodies to the members of the first National Assembly,)
to foresee in clear succession the long career of revolutionary frenzy, which soon afterwards
deluged Europe with tears and blood. This may perhaps be conceded, and without prejudice to
the doctrine just now delivered, of endless diversity in political events. For it is certain
that the political movements of nations obey everlasting laws, and travel through the stages
of known cycles, which thus insure enough of resemblance to guarantee the general outline of
a sagacious prophecy; whilst on the other hand, the times, the people, and the extraordinary
minds which, in such critical eras, soon reveal themselves at the head of affairs, never fail
of producing their appropriate and characteristic results of difference. Sameness enough there
will always be to encourage the true political seer; with difference enough to confer upon
each revolution its separate character and its peculiar interest.

All this is strikingly illustrated in the history of those great revolutionary events, which
belong to the life and times of the Emperor Charlemagne. If any one period in history might
be supposed to offer a barren and unprofitable picture of war, rapine, and bloodshed--unfeatured
by characteristic differences, and unimproved by any peculiar moral, it is this section of
the European annals. Removed from our present times by a thousand years, divided from us by
the profound gulf of what we usually denominate the dark ages; placed, in fact, entirely upon
the farther [Footnote 3] side of that great barrier--this period of history can hardly be expected
to receive much light from contemporary documents in an age so generally illiterate. Not from
national archives, or state papers, when diplomacy was so rare, when so large a proportion
of its simple transactions was conducted by personal intercourse, and after the destruction
wrought amongst its slender chancery of written memorials by the revolution of one entire millenium.
Still less could we have reason to hope for much light from private memoirs at a period when
the means of writing were as slenderly diffused as the motives; when the rare endowments, natural
and acquired, for composing history could so seldom happen to coincide with the opportunities
for obtaining accurate information; when the writers were so few, and the audience so limited
and so widely dispersed, to which they could then profitably address themselves. With or without
illustration, however, the age itself and its rapid succession of wars between barbarous and
semi-barbarous tribes, might, if any one chapter in history, be presumed barren of either interest
or instruction, wearisomely monotonous; and, by comparison with any parallel section from the
records of other nations in the earliest stages of dawning civilization, offering no one feature
of novelty beyond the names of the combatants, their local and chronological relations, and
the peculiar accidents and unimportant circumstances of variety in the conduct or issue of
the several battles which they fought.

Yet, in contradiction to all these very plausible presumptions, even this remote period teems
with its own peculiar and separate instruction. It is the first great station, so to speak,
which we reach after entering the portals of modern [Footnote 4] history. It presents us with
the evolution and propagation of Christianity in its present central abodes; with the great
march of civilization, and the gathering within the pale of that mighty agency for elevating
human nature, and beneath the gentle yoke of the only true and beneficent religion, of the
last rebellious recusants among the European family of nations. We meet also, in conjunction
with the other steps of the vast humanizing process then going on, the earliest efforts at
legislation--recording at the same time the barbarous condition of those for whom they were
designed, and the anti-barbarous views and aspirations of the legislator in the midst of his
condescensions to the infirmities of his subjects. Here also we meet with the elementary state,
growing and as yet imperfectly rooted, of feudalism. Here, too, we behold in their incunabula,
forming and arranging themselves under the pressure of circumstances, the existing kingdoms
of Christendom. So far, then, from being a mere echo, or repetition, of other passages in history,
the period of Charlemagne is rich and novel in its instruction, and almost (we might say) unique
in the quality of that instruction. For here only perhaps we see the social system forming
itself in the mine, and the very process, as it were, of crystallization going on beneath our
eyes. Mr. James, therefore, may be regarded as not less fortunate in the choice of his subject,
than meritorious in its treatment; indeed, his work is not so much the best, as the only history
of Charlemagne which will hereafter be cited. For it reposes upon a far greater body of research
and collation, than has hitherto been applied [Footnote 4] even in France to this interesting
theme; and in effect it is the first account of the great emperor and his times which can,
with a due valuation of the term, be complimented with the title of a critical memoir. Charlemagne,
'the greatest man of the middle ages,' in the judgment of his present biographer, was born
A. D. 742--seven years before his father assumed the name of King. This date has been disputed:
but, on the whole, we may take it as settled, upon various collateral computations, that the
year now assigned is the true one. The place is less certain: but we do not think Mr. James
warranted in saying that it is 'unknown.' If every thing is to be pronounced 'unknown,' for
which there is no absolute proof of a kind to satisfy forensic rules of evidence, or which
has ever been made a question for debate, in that case we may apply a sponge to the greater
part of history before the era of printing.

Aix-la-Chapelle, Mr. James goes on to tell us, is implied as the birth-place of one of the
chief authorities. But our own impression is, that according to the general belief of succeeding
ages, it was not Aix-la-Chapelle, but Ingelheim, a village near Mentz, to which that honor
belonged. Some have supposed that Carlsburg, in Bavaria, was the true place of his birth; and,
indeed, that it drew its name from that distinguished event. Frantzius, in particular, says,
that in his day the castle of that place was still shown to travellers with the reverential
interest attached to such a pretension. But, after all, he gives his own vote for Ingelheim;
and it is singular that he does not so much as mention Aix-la-Chapelle. Of his education and
his early years, Mr. James is of opinion that we know as little as of his birth-place. Certainly
our information upon these particulars is neither full nor circumstantial; yet we know as much,
perhaps, in these respects, of Charlemagne as of Napoleon Bonaparte. And remarkable enough
it is, that not relatively, (or making allowances for the age,) but absolutely, Charlemagne
was much more accomplished than Napoleon in the ordinary business of a modern education; Charlemagne,
in the middle of the 8th century, than Napoleon in the latter end of the 18th. Charlemagne
was, in fact, the most accomplished man of his age; Napoleon a sciolist for any age. The tutor
of Charlemagne was Peter of Pisa, a man eminent at that time for his attainments in literature
(in re grammatica). From him it was that Charlemagne learned Latin and Greek; Greek in such
a degree 'ut sufficienter intelligeret,' and Latin to the extent of using it familiarly and
fluently in conversation. Now, as to the man of the 18th century, Greek was to him as much
a sealed language as Chinese; and, even with regard to Latin, his own secretary doubts, upon
one occasion, whether he were sufficiently master of it to translate Juvenal's expressive words
of Panem et Circenses. Yet he had enjoyed the benefits of an education in a Royal College,
in a country which regards itself self-complacently as at the head of civilization. Again,
there is a pretty strong tradition, (which could hardly arise but upon some foundation,) that
Charlemagne had cultivated the Arabic so far as to talk it; [Footnote 6] having no motive to
that attainment more urgent than that political considerations made it eligible for him to
undertake an expedition against those who could negotiate in no other language. Now, let it
be considered how very much more powerful arguments there were in Napoleon's position for mastering
the German and the English. His continental policy moved entirely upon the pivot of central
Europe, that is, the German system of nations--the great federation of powers upon the Rhine
and the Danube. And, as to England, his policy and his passions alike pointed in that direction
as uniformly and as inevitably as the needle to the Pole: every morning, we are told, tossing
aside the Paris journals as so many babbling echoes of his own public illusions, expressing
rather what was desired, than what was probable, he required of his secretary that he should
read off into French the leading newspapers of England. And many were the times when he started
up in fury, and passionately taxed his interpreter with mistranslation; sometimes as softening
the expressions, sometimes as over-coloring their violence. Evidently he lay at the mercy of
one whom he knew to be wanting in honor, and who had it in his power, either by way of abetting
any sinister views of his own, or in collusion with others, to suppress--to add--to garble--and
in every possible way to color and distort what he was interpreting. Yet neither could this
humiliating sense of dependency on the one hand, nor the instant pressure of political interest
on the other, ever urge Napoleon to the effort of learning English in the first case, German
or Spanish in the second. Charlemagne again cultivated most strenuously and successfully, as
an accomplishment peculiarly belonging to the functions of his high station, the art and practice
of eloquence; and he had this reward of his exertions--that he was accounted the most eloquent
man of his age: 'totis viribus ad orationem exercendam conversus naturalem facundiam ita roboravit
studio, ut praeter [l. propter] promptum ac profluens sermonis genus facile aevi sui eloquentissimus
crederetur.'

Turn to Bonaparte. It was a saying of his sycophants, that he sometimes spoke like a god, and
sometimes worse than the feeblest of mortals. But, says one who knew him well,--the mortal
I have often heard, unfortunately never yet the god. He who sent down this sneer to posterity,
was at Napoleon's right hand on the most memorable occasion of his whole career--that cardinal
occasion, as we may aptly term it, (for upon that his whole fortunes hinged,) when he intruded
violently upon the legislative body, dissolved the Directory and effected the revolution of
the 18th Brumaire. That revolution it was which raised him to the Consular power; and by that
revolution, considered in its manner and style, we may judge of Napoleon in several of his
chief pretensions--courage, presence of mind, dignity, and eloquence; for then, if ever, these
qualities were all in instant requisition; one word effectually urged by the antagonist parties,
a breath, a gesture, a nod, suitably followed up, would have made the total difference between
ruler of France and a traitor hurried away a la lanterne. It is true that the miserable imbecility
of all who should have led the hostile parties, the irresolution and the quiet-loving temper
of Moreau, the base timidity of Bernadotte, in fact, the total defect of heroic minds amongst
the French of that day, neutralized the defects and more than compensated the blunders of Napoleon.
But these were advantages that could not be depended on: a glass of brandy extraordinary might
have emboldened the greatest poltroon to do that which, by once rousing a movement of popular
enthusiasm, once making a beginning in that direction, would have precipitated the whole affair
into hands which must have carried it far beyond the power of any party to control. Never,
according to all human calculation, were eloquence and presence of mind so requisite: never
was either so deplorably wanting. A passionate exposition of the national degradations inflicted
by the imbecility of the Directors, an appeal to the Assembly as Frenchmen, contrasting the
glories of 1796 with the humiliating campaigns that had followed, might, by connecting the
new candidate for power with the public glory, and the existing rulers with all the dishonors
which had settled on the French banners, have given an electric shock to the patriotism of
the audience, such as would have been capable for the moment of absorbing their feelings as
partisans. In a French assembly, movements of that nature, under a momentary impulse, are far
from being uncommon. Here, then, if never before, and never again, the grandeur of the occasion
demanded--almost, we might say, implored, and clamorously invoked, the effectual powers of
eloquence and perfect self-possession. How was the occasion met? Let us turn to the actual
scene, as painted in lively colors by a friend and an eye-witness: [Footnote 7]--'The accounts
brought every instant to General Bonaparte determined him to enter the hall [of the Ancients]
and take part in the debate. His entrance was hasty and in anger--no favorable prognostics
of what he would say. The passage by which we entered led directly forward into the middle
of the house; our backs were towards the door; Bonaparte had the President on his right; he
could not see him quite in front. I found myself on the General's right; our clothes touched:
Berthier was on his left.

'All the harangues composed for Bonaparte after the event differ from each other;--no miracle
that. There was, in fact, none pronounced to the Ancients; unless a broken conversation with
the President, carried on without nobleness, propriety, or dignity, may be called a speech.
We heard only these words--"Brothers in arms--frankness of a soldier." The interrogatories
of the President were clear. Nothing could be more confused or worse enounced, than the ambiguous
and disjointed replies of Bonaparte. He spoke incoherently of volcanoes--secret agitations--victories--constitution
violated. He found fault even with the 18th Fructidor, of which he had himself been the prime
instigator and most powerful upholder.' [Not, reader, observe, from bold time-serving neglect
of his own principles, but from absolute distraction of mind, and incoherency of purpose.]
'Then came Caesar--Cromwell--Tyrant'--[allusions which, of all others, were the most unseasonable
for that crisis, and for his position.] 'He repeated several times--I have no more than that
to tell you; and he had told them nothing. Then out came the words,--Liberty, Equality: for
these every one saw he had not come to St. Cloud. Then his action became animated, and we lost
him--comprehending nothing beyond 18th Fructidor, 30 Prairial, hypocrites, intriguers; I am
not so; I shall declare all; I will abdicate the power when the danger which threatens the
Republic has passed.' Then, after further instances of Napoleon's falsehood, and the self-contradictory
movements of his disjointed babble, the secretary goes on thus: 'These interruptions, apostrophes,
and interrogations, overwhelmed him; he believed himself lost. The disapprobation became more
violent, and his discourse still more wanting in method and coherence. Sometimes he addressed
the representatives, quite stultified; sometimes the military in the court,' [i. e. outside,]
'who were beyond hearing; then, without any transition, he spoke of the thunder of war--saying,
I am accompanied by the god of war and fortune. The President then calmly observed to him that
he found nothing, absolutely nothing, upon which they could deliberate; that all he had said
was vague. Explain yourself, unfold the plots into which you have been invited to enter. Bonaparte
repeated the same things; and in what style! No idea in truth can be formed of the whole scene,
unless by those present. There was not the least order in all he stammered out (to speak sincerely)
with the most inconceivable incoherence. Bonaparte was no orator. Perceiving the bad effect
produced upon the meeting by this rhapsody, and the progressive confusion of the speaker, I
whispered (pulling his coat gently at the same time)--'Retire, General, you no longer know
what you are saying.' I made a sign to Berthier to second me in persuading him to leave the
place; when suddenly, after stammering out a few words more, he turned round, saying, 'Let
all who love me follow.' So ended this famous scene--in which, more than in any other upon
record, eloquence and presence of mind were needful. And if it should be said that vagueness
was not altogether the least eligible feature in a speech whose very purpose was to confuse,
and to leave no room for answer, we reply--true; but then it was the vagueness of art, which
promised to be serviceable, and that of preconcerted perplexity, not the vagueness of incoherence,
and a rhapsody of utter contradiction. But let me hear from you on the subject.

Now for my own business.

During my illness I was exceedingly affected by the thought that
month had glided away after month, and year after year, and still
had found and left me only'preparing'for the experiments which are
to ascertain whether the hopes of those who have hoped proudly of
me have been auspicious omens or mere delusions; and the anxiety to
realize something, and finish something, has, no doubt, in some measure
retarded my recovery.

(For instance, in all the writings of the ancients I recollect nothing that, strictly examined,
can be called humour; yet Chaucer abounds with it, and Dante, too, though in a very different way. Thus, too,
the passion for personifications and, "me judice", strong, sharp, practical good sense, which I feel
to constitute a strikingly characteristic difference in favour of the "feudal" poets.) As to information,
I could give you a critical sketch of poems, written by contemporaries of Chaucer, in Germany;
an epic to compare with his "Palamon", and tales with his Tales, descriptive and fanciful poems
with those of the same kind in our own poet. In short, a Life of Chaucer ought, in the work
itself, and in the appendices of the work, to make the poet explain his age, and to make the age both
explain the poet, and evince the superiority of the poet over his age. I think that the publication
of such a work would do "your" work some little service, in more ways than one. It would occasion,
necessarily, a double review of it in all the Reviews; and there is a large class of fashionable
men who have been pleased of late to take me into high favour, and among whom even my name might have
some influence, and my praises of you weight.

I write now to ask your advice respecting the time and manner of its publication, and the choice of
a publisher, I entitle it'Organum Vera Organum, or an Instrument
of Practical Reasoning in the Business of Real Life'; [1] to which
will be prefixed, 1.

A familiar introduction to the common system of Logic, namely, that
of Aristotle and the Schools.

2.

A concise and simple, yet full statement of the Aristotelian Logic,
with reference annexed to the authors, and the name and page of the
work to which each part may be traced, so that it may be at once seen
what is Aristotle's, what Porphyry's, what the addition of the Greek
Commentators, and what of the Schoolmen.

Of the Eleatic and Megaric Logic.

3d Chap. of the Platonic Logic. 4th Chap, of Aristotle, containing a fair account of the "*
[Greek: Orhganon]-- of which Dr. Reid, in'Kaimes'Sketches of Man', has given a most false, and not only erroneous,
but calumnious statement-- in as far as the account had not been
anticipated in the second part of my work, namely, the concise and
simple, yet full, etc. etc. 5th Chap. A philosophical examination of the
truth and of the value of the Aristotelian System of Logic, including
all the after-additions to it.

The work is half written" out ", and the materials of the other
half are all in paper, or rather on papers. I should not expect one
farthing till the work was delivered entire; and I would deliver
it at once, if it were wished.

As soon as you possibly can do something respecting the abridgment
of Tucker, [1] do so; you will, on my honour, be doing" good ", in
the best sense of the word! Of course I cannot wish you to do anything
till after the 24th, unless it should be" put "in your way to read
that part of the letter to Phillips. If the former, would you advise
me to sell the copyright at once, or only one or more editions? Can you
give me a general notion what terms I have a right to insist on in
either case?

I fear that it may extend to seven hundred pages; and would it be better to publish the Introduction of
History separately, either after or before? Stowey, Feb. 17, 1803.

8th Chap. Peter Ramus. 9th Chap. Lord Bacon, or the Verulamian Logic. both Chap. Examination of
the same, and comparison of it with the Logic of Plato (in which
I attempt to make it probable that, though considered by Bacon himself
as the antithesis and the antidote of Plato, it is'bona fide'the same,
and that Plato has been misunderstood).

[2] 10th Chap. TO GODWIN Friday, July 10, 1803. The whole will conclude
with considerations of the value of the work, or its practical utility
in scientific investigations (especially the first part, which contains
the strictly demonstrative reasonings, and the analysis of all the
acts and passions of the mind which may be employed to the discovery
of truth) in the arts of healing, especially in those parts that contain
a catalogue, etc. of probable reasoning; lastly, to the senate, the
pulpit, and our law courts, to whom the whole-- but especially the
latter three-fourths of the work, on the probable and the false--
will be useful, and finally instructive, how to form a commonplace
book by the aid of this Instrument, so as to read with practical advantage,
and (supposing average talents) to'ensure'a facility and rapidity
in proving and in computing.

But, if I cannot engage with a bookseller for this, I must do something else" first ", which I should
be sorry for. Your division of the sorts of works acceptable to booksellers is just, and what
has been always my own notion or rather knowledge; but, though I detailed the whole of the contents
of my work so fully to you, I did not mean to lay any stress with the bookseller on the first half,
but simply state it as preceded by a familiar introduction, and critical history of logic. 6th
Chap. On the characteristic merits and demerits of Aristotle and Plato as philosophers in general, and an attempt
to explain the fact of the vast influence of the former during so
many ages; and of the influence of Plato's works on the restoration
of the Belles Lettres, and on the Reformation.

7th Chap. Raymund Lully. If I could convey to you any tolerably distinct notion of the state of
my spirits of late, and the train or the sort of my ideas consequent on that state, you would feel instantly
that my non-performance of the promise is matter of'regret'with me indeed, but not of'compunction'. It was my
full intention to have prepared immediately a second volume of poems
for the press; but, though the poems are all either written or composed,
excepting only the conclusion of one poem (equal to four days'common
work) and a few corrections, and though I had the most pressing motives
for sending them off, yet after many attempts I was obliged to give
up the very hope-- the attempts acted so perniciously on my disorder.

Wordsworth, too, wished, and in a very particular manner expressed the wish, that I should write
to him at large on a poetic subject, which he has at present'sub malleo ardentem et ignitum'. I made the
attempt, but I could not command my recollections. It seemed a dream that I had ever'thought'on
poetry, or had ever written it, so remote were my trains of ideas from composition or criticism on
composition. These two instances will, in some manner, explain my non-performance; but, indeed, I
have been very ill, and that I have done anything in any way is a subject of wonder to myself,
and of no causeless self-complacency. Yet I am anxious to do something which may convince you of my sincerity
by zeal: and, if you think that it will be of any service to you,
I will send down for the work; I will instantly give it a perusal'con
amore'; and partly by my reverential love of Chaucer, and partly from
my affectionate esteem for his biographer (the summer, too, bringing
increase of health with it), I doubt not that my old mind will recur
to me; and I will forthwith write a series of letters, containing
a critique on Chaucer, and on the'Life of Chaucer', by W. Godwin,
and publish them, with my name, either at once in a small volume,
or in the'Morning Post'in the first instance, and republish them afterwards.

The great thing to be done is to present Chaucer stripped of all his adventitious matter, his translations,
etc.; to analyse his own real productions, to deduce his province and his rank; then to compare him
with his contemporaries, or with immediate prede-and suc-cessors, first as an Englishman, and secondly
as a European; then with Spenser and with Shakespeare, between whom
he seems to stand mid-way, with, however, a manner of his own which
belongs to neither, with a manner and an excellence; lastly, to compare
Dante and Chaucer, and inclusively Spenser and Shakespere, with the ancients,
to abstract the characteristic differences, and to develop the causes
of such differences.

The abridgment was made, and published in 1807.] [Footnote 2: Letter CXXXVII follows 119.] Godwin
published his'Life of Chaucer'in 1803. The next letter refers to this work. Descartes, 11th Chap.
Condillac, and a philosophical examination of'his'logic,'i. e.'the logic which he basely purloined
from Hartley. Then follows my own'Organum Vera Organum', which consists of a* [Greek: Eustaema] of
all'possible'modes of true, probable, and false reasoning, arranged philosophically,'i. e.'on
a strict analysis of those operations and passions of the mind in which they originate, or by which
they act; with one or more striking instances annexed to each, from authors of high estimation, and
to each instance of false reasoning, the manner in which the sophistry is to be detected, and
the words in which it may be exposed. It never answered, as far as I can find, in any instance. As
to my own work, let me correct one or two conceptions of yours respecting it. I am now, however, ready
to go to the press with a work which I consider as introductory to a'system', though to the public
it will appear altogether a thing by itself. And, lastly, to whom would you advise me to apply?
2d Chap. And even the sale of a first edition is not without objections on this score-- to
this, however, I should certainly adhere, and it is my resolution. On the work itself I meant to lay
all the stress, as a work really in request, and non-existent, either well or ill-done, and to put
the work in the" same class "with" Guthrie "and books of practical instruction-- for the universities,
classes of scholars, lawyers, etc. etc. Its profitable sale will greatly depend on the pushing of the
booksellers, and on its being considered as a" practical "book," Organum vere Organum ", a
book by which the reader is to acquire not only knowledge, but likewise" power ". And a friend of
mine, every way calculated by his taste and private studies for such a work, [1] is willing to abridge
and systematize that work from eight to two volumes-- in the words of Paley," to dispose into
method, to collect into heads and articles, and to exhibit in more compact and tangible masses, what
in that otherwise excellent performance is spread over too much surface. "I would prefix to it an essay
containing the whole substance of the first volume of Hartley; entirely
defecated from all the corpuscular hypothesis, with more illustrations.

I give
my name to the essay. Likewise I will revise every sheet of the abridgment.
I should think the character of the work, and the above quotations from
so high an authority (with the present public, I mean) as Paley, would
ensure its success. If you will read or transcribe, and send this to Mr.
Phillips, or to any other publisher (Longman and Rees excepted) you
would greatly oblige me; that is to say, my dear Godwin, you would
essentially serve a young man of profound genius and original mind,
who wishes to get his'Sabine'subsistence by some employment from the
booksellers, while he is employing the remainder of his time in nursing
up his genius for the destiny which he believes appurtenant to it."

Qui cito facit, bis facit. "Impose any task on me in return.

[2] [Footnote 1: Hazlitt. Greta Hall. My dear Godwin, Your letter has this moment reached me, and found me
writing for Stuart, to whom I am under a positive engagement to produce
three essays by the beginning of next week.

To promise, therefore, to do what I could not do would be worse than idle; and to attempt to do what I could
not do well, from distraction of mind, would be trifling with my time and your patience. [1] [Footnote
1: Letter CXXXVI follows 118.] The last four letters were written from Stowey, whither Coleridge
had gone on a visit to Poole.

During the same period some events had taken place which changed
the aspect of things.

He had become acquainted with William Sotheby, the poet, translator
of Homer and Wieland, to whom he communicated in long letters his
views on Wordsworth's theory of poetic diction, indicating a widening
divergence from his brother poet.

He had also made for the satisfaction of Sotheby a translation in
blank verse of Gessner's'Erste Schiffer', which has been lost ('Letters',
369-401).

He had likewise paraphrased one of Gessner's Idylls, published as
the'Picture of The Lover's Resolution', in the'Morning Post'of 6th
September 1802.'Dejection, an Ode', the'Hymn before Sunrise', and
the beautiful dramatic fragment, the'Night Scene', are the last products
of Coleridge's chilled poetic imagination.

A third edition (1803) of the Early Poems was issued under the superintendence of Lamb ('Ainger',
i, 199-206). He had made a second tour in Wales in company with Tom Wedgwood in November and December 1802
('Letters', 410-417) returning to find that Sara had been born on 23rd
December 1802.

In August 1803 Coleridge went on tour to Scotland with the Wordsworths ('Letters', 451, and Dorothy Wordsworth's'Journal').
It is impossible for us to give all the correspondence of this busy, mental period, but on 4th
June 1803, Coleridge writes to Godwin. LETTER 119. To GODWIN Saturday
Night, June 4, 1803. Greta Hall, Keswick. My dear Godwin, I trust
that my dear friend, C. Lamb, will have informed you how seriously
ill I have been. I arrived at Keswick on Good Friday, caught the influenza,
have struggled on in a series of convalescence and relapse, the disease
still assuming new shapes and symptoms; and, though I am certainly
better than at any former period of the disease, and more steadily
convalescent, yet it is not mere'low spirits'that makes me doubt whether
I shall ever wholly surmount the effects of it.

I owe, then, explanation to you, for I quitted town, with strong feelings
of affectionate esteem towards you, and a firm resolution to write to
you within a short time after my arrival at my home.

Phillips is a pushing man, and a book is sure to have fair play if it be his'property'; and it could
not be other than pleasant to me to have the same publisher with yourself,'but'----. Now if there be
anything of impatience, that whether truth and justice ought to follow that"'but'"you will inform
me. It is not my habit to go to work so seriously about matters of pecuniary business; but my ill
health makes my life more than ordinarily uncertain, and I have a wife
and three little ones. If your judgment leads you to advise me to offer
it to Phillips, would you take the trouble of talking with him on the subject,
and give him your real opinion, whatever it may be, of the work and
of the powers of the author?

When this book is fairly off my hands, I shall, if I live and have
sufficient health, set seriously to work in arranging what I have
already written, and in pushing forward my studies and my investigations
relative to the'omne scibile'of human nature--'what'we are, and'how
we become'what we are; so as to solve the two grand problems-- how,
being acted upon, we shall act; how, acting, we shall be acted upon.

But between me and this work there may be death.

I hope your wife and little ones are well.

I have had a sick family.

At one time every individual-- master, mistress, children, and servants--
were all laid up in bed, and we were waited on by persons hired from
the town for the week.

But now all are well, I only excepted.

If you find my paper smell, or my style savour of scholastic quiddity,
you must attribute it to the infectious quality of the folio on which
I am writing-- namely,'Scotus Erigena de Divisione Naturae', the forerunner,
by some centuries, of the schoolmen.

I cherish all kinds of honourable feelings towards you; and I am,
dear Godwin, Yours most sincerely, S. T. COLERIDGE.

[Footnote 1 Extant in MS. See'Athenaeum', 26th October 1895.] [Footnote 2: See the'Friend',
Bohn Library, pp. 319-345.] You know the high character and present scarcity of'Tuckers Light of Nature'."
I have found in this writer "(says Paley, in his preface to his'Moral
and Political Philosophy')" more original thinking and observation
upon the several subjects he has taken in hand than in any other,
not to say in all others put together ".

His talent also for illustration is unrivalled. But his thoughts are diffused through a long,
various, and irregular work. I could, no doubt, induce my friends to publish the work for me,
but I am possessed of facts that deter me. I know that the booksellers not only do not encourage, but
that they use unjustifiable artifices to injure works published on the authors'own account. 3. An outline of
the History of Logic in general, 1st Chapter. The Origin of Philosophy
in general, and of Logic'speciatim'. But I must do something immediately.
Now, if I knew that any bookseller would purchase the first edition
of this work, as numerous as he pleased, I should put the work out of hand
at once," totus in illo ".

But it was never my intention to send one single sheet to the press till the whole was" bona fide
"ready for the printer-- that is, both written, and fairly written. LETTER 120. I have thus amply
detailed the contents of my work, which has not been the labour of
one year or of two, but the result of many years'meditations, and
of very various reading.

The size of the work will, printed at thirty lines a page, form one volume octavo, 500 pages to the volume;
and I shall be ready with the first half of the work for the printer at a fortnight's notice. Now,
my dear friend, give me your thoughts on the subject: would you have
me to offer it to the booksellers, or, by the assistance of my friends,
print and publish on my own account?

 But as to the Franks, in particular, if they resembled their modern
representatives in their most conspicuous moral feature, it would be more true to say, that
the bribe and the almost magical seduction for them, capable of charming away their sternest
resolutions, and of relaxing the hand of the patriot when grasping his noblest birthright,
has ever lain in great military success, in the power of bringing victory to the national standards,
and in continued offerings on the altar of public vanity. In their estimate for above a thousand
years, it has been found true that the harvest of a few splendid campaigns, reaped upon the
fields of neighboring nations, far outweighs any amount of humbler blessings in the shape of
civil and political privileges. Charlemagne as a conqueror, and by far the greatest illustrator
of the Frankish name, might easily have conciliated their gratitude and admiration into a surrender
of popular rights; or, profiting by his high situation, and the confidence reposed in him,
he might have undermined their props; or, by a direct exertion of his power, he might have
peremptorily resumed them. Slowly and surely, or summarily and with violence, this great emperor
had the national privileges in his power. But the beneficence of his purposes required no such
aggression on the rights of his subjects. War brought with it naturally some extension of power;
and a military jurisdiction is necessarily armed with some discretionary license. But in the
civil exercise of his authority, the emperor was content with the powers awarded to him by
law and custom. His great schemes of policy were all of a nature to prepare his subjects for
a condition of larger political influence; he could not in consistency be adverse to an end
towards which he so anxiously prepared the means. And it is certain, that, although some German
writers have attempted to fasten upon Charlemagne a charge of vexatious inquisition into the
minor police of domestic life, and into petty details of economy below the majesty of his official
character, even their vigilance of research--sharpened by malice--has been unable to detect
throughout his long reign, and in the hurry of sudden exigencies natural to a state of uninterrupted
warfare and alarm, one single act of tyranny, personal revenge, or violation of the existing
laws. Charlemagne, like Napoleon, had bitter enemies--some who were such to his government
and his public purposes; some again to his person upon motives of private revenge. Tassilo,
for example, the Duke of Bavaria, and Desiderius, the King of the Lombards, acted against him
upon the bitterest instigations of feminine resentment; each of these princes conceiving himself
concerned in a family quarrel, pursued the cause which he had adopted in the most ferocious
spirit of revenge, and would undoubtedly have inflicted death upon Charlemagne, had he fallen
into their power. Of this he must himself have been sensible; and yet, when the chance of war
threw both of them into his power, he forbore to exercise even those rights of retaliation
for their many provocations which the custom of that age sanctioned universally; he neither
mutilated nor deprived them of sight. Confinement to religious seclusion was all that he inflicted;
and in the case of Tassilo, where mercy could be more safely exercised, he pardoned him so
often, that it became evident in what current his feelings ran, wherever the cruel necessities
of the public service allowed him to indulge them.

In the conspiracy formed against him, upon the provocations offered to the Frankish nobility
by his third wife, he showed the same spirit of excessive clemency,--a clemency which again
reminds us of the first Caesar, and which was not merely parental, but often recalls to us
the long-suffering and tenderness of spirit which belong to the infirmity of maternal affection.
Here are no Palms, executed for no real offence known to the laws of his country, and without
a trial such as any laws in any country would have conceded. No innocent D'Enghiens murdered,
without the shadow of provocation, and purely on account of his own reversionary rights; not
for doing or meditating wrong, but because the claims which unfortunately he inherited might
by possibility become available in his person; not, therefore, even as an enemy by intention
or premeditation; not even as an apparent competitor, but in the rare character of a competitor
presumptive; one who might become an ideal competitor by the extinction of a whole family,
and even then no substantial competitor until after a revolution in France, which must already
have undermined the throne of Bonaparte. To his own subjects, and his own kinsmen, never did
Charlemagne forget to be, in acts, as well as words, a parent. In his foreign relations, it
is true, for one single purpose of effectual warning Charlemagne put forth a solitary trait
of Roman harshness. This is the case which we have already noticed and defended; and, with
a view to the comparison with Napoleon, remarkable enough it is, that the numbers sacrificed
on this occasion are pretty nearly the same as on the celebrated massacre at Jaffa, perpetrated
by Napoleon in council. [Footnote 13] In the Saxon, as in the Syrian massacre, the numbers
were between four and five thousand; not that the numbers or the scale of the transaction can
affect its principle, but it is well to know it, because then to its author, as now to us who
sit as judges upon it, that circumstance cannot be supposed to have failed in drawing the very
keenest attention to its previous consideration. A butchery, that was in a numerical sense
so vast, cannot be supposed to have escaped its author in a hurry, or to be open to any of
the usual palliations from precipitance or inattention. Charlemagne and Napoleon must equally
be presumed to have regarded this act on all sides, to have weighed it in and for itself, and
to have traversed by anticipation the whole sum of its consequences. In the one case we find
a general, the leader of a soi-disant Christian army, the representative of the 'most Christian'
nation, and, as amongst infidels, specially charged with the duty of supporting the sanctity
of Christian good faith, unfortunately pledged by his own most confidential and accredited
agents, officers bearing on their persons the known ensigns of his aides-de-camp, to a comprehensive
promise of mercy to a large body of Turkish troops, having arms in their hands, and otherwise
well-disposed and well able to have made a desperate defence. This promise was peculiarly embarrassing;
provisions ran short, and, to detain them as prisoners, would draw murmurs from his own troops,
now suffering hardships themselves. On the other hand, to have turned them adrift would have
insured their speedy re-appearance as active enemies to a diminished and debilitated army;
for, as to sending them off by sea, that measure was impracticable, as well from want of shipping
as from the presence of the English. Such was the dilemma, doubtless perplexing enough, but
not more so than in ten thousand other cases, for which their own appropriate ten thousand
remedies have been found. What was the issue? The entire body of gallant (many, doubtless,
young and innocent) soldiers, disarmed upon the faith of a solemn guarantee from a Christian
general, standing in the very steps of the noble (and the more noble, because bigoted) Crusaders,
were all mowed down by the musketry of their thrice accursed enemy; and, by way of crowning
treachery with treachery, some few who had swum off to a point of rock in the sea, were lured
back to destruction under a second series of promises, violated almost at the very instant
when uttered. A larger or more damnable murder does not stain the memory of any brigand, buccaneer,
or pirate; nor has any army, Huns, Vandals, or Mogul Tartars, ever polluted itself by so base
a perfidy; for, in this memorable tragedy, the whole army were accomplices.

Now, as to Charlemagne, he had tried the effect of forgiveness and lenity often in vain. Clemency
was misinterpreted; it had been, and it would be, construed into conscious weakness. Under
these circumstances, with a view, undoubtedly, to the final extinction of rebellions which
involved infinite bloodshed on both sides, he permitted one trial to be made of a severe and
sanguinary chastisement. It failed; insurrections proceeded as before, and it was not repeated.
But the main difference in the principle of the two cases is this, that Charlemagne had exacted
no penalty but one, which the laws of war in that age conferred, and even in this age the laws
of allegiance. However bloody, therefore, this tragedy was no murder. It was a judicial punishment,
built upon known acts and admitted laws, designed in mercy, consented to unwillingly, and finally
repented. Lastly, instead of being one in a multitude of acts bearing the same character, it
stood alone in a long career of intercourse with wild and ferocious nations, owning no control
but that of the spear and sword.

Many are the points of comparison, and some of them remarkable enough, in the other circumstances
of the two careers, separated by a thousand years. Both effected the passage of the Great St.
Bernard; [Footnote 14] but the one in an age when mechanical forces, and the aids of art, were
yet imperfectly developed; the other in an age when science had armed the arts of war and of
locomotion with the fabulous powers of the Titans, and with the whole resources of a mighty
nation at his immediate disposal. Both, by means of this extraordinary feat, achieved the conquest
of Lombardy in a single hour; but Charlemagne, without once risking the original impression
of this coup d'eclat; Napoleon, on the other hand, so entirely squandering and forfeiting his
own success, that in the battle which followed he was at first utterly defeated, and but for
the blunder of his enemy, and the sudden aid of an accomplished friend, irretrievably. Both
suffered politically by the repudiation of a wife; but Charlemagne, under adequate provocation,
and with no final result of evil; Bonaparte under heavy aggravations of ingratitude and indiscretion.
Both assumed the character of a patron to learning and learned men; but Napoleon, in an age
when knowledge of every kind was self-patronized--when no possible exertions of power could
avail to crush it--and yet, under these circumstances, with utter insincerity. Charlemagne,
on the other hand, at a time when the countenance of a powerful protector made the whole difference
between revival and a long extinction--and what was still more to the purpose of doing honor
to his memory, not merely in a spirit of sincerity, but of fervid activity. Not content with
drawing counsel and aid from the cells of Northumberland, even the short time which he passed
at Rome, he had 'collected a number of grammarians (that is litterateurs) and arithmeticians,
the poor remains of the orators and philosophers of the past, and engaged them to accompany
him from Italy to France.'

What resulted in each case from these great efforts and prodigious successes? Each failed in
laying the foundations of any permanent inheritance to his own glory in his own family. But
Bonaparte lived to lay in ruins even his personal interest in this great edifice of empire;
and that entirely by his own desperate presumption, precipitance, and absolute defect of self-command.
Charlemagne, on his part, lost nothing of what he had gained: if his posterity did not long
maintain the elevation to which he had raised them, that did but the more proclaim the grandeur
of the mind which had reared a colossal empire, that sunk under any powers inferior to his
own. If the empire itself lost its unity, and divided into sections, even thus it did not lose
the splendor and prosperity of its separate parts; and the praise remains entire--let succeeding
princes, as conservators, have failed as much and as excusably as they might--that he erected
the following splendid empire:--The whole of France and Belgium, with their natural boundaries
of the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Ocean, the Mediterranean; to the south, Spain, between the Ebro
and the Pyrenees; and to the north, the whole of Germany, up to the banks of the Elbe. Italy,
as far as the Lower Calabria, was either governed by his son, or tributary to his crown; Dalmatia,
Croatia, Liburnia, and Istria, (with the exception of the maritime cities,) were joined to
the territories, which he had himself conquered, of Hungary and Bohemia. As far as the conflux
of the Danube with the Teyss and the Save, the east of Europe acknowledged his power. Most
of the Sclavonian tribes, between the Elbe and the Vistula, paid tribute and professed obedience;
and Corsica, Sardinia, with the Balearic Islands, were dependent upon his possessions in Italy
and Spain.

His moral were yet greater than his territorial conquests: In the eloquent language of his
present historian, 'he snatched from darkness all the lands he conquered; and may be said to
have added the whole of Germany to the world.' Wherever he moved, civilization followed his
footsteps. What he conquered was emphatically the conquest of his own genius; and his vast
empire was, in a peculiar sense, his own creation. And what, under general circumstances, would
have exposed the hollowness and insufficiency of his establishment, was for him, in particular,
the seal and attestation of his extraordinary grandeur of mind. His empire dissolved after
he had departed; his dominions lost their cohesion, and slipped away from the nerveless hands
which succeeded; a sufficient evidence--were there no other--that all the vast resources of
the Frankish throne, wielded by imbecile minds, were inadequate to maintain that which, in
the hands of a Charlemagne, they had availed to conquer and cement.

NOTES

NOTE 1.

In part we say, because in part also the characteristic differences of these works depend upon
the particular mode of the narrative. For narration itself, as applied to history, admits of
a triple arrangement--dogmatic, sceptical, and critical; dogmatic, which adopts the current
records without examination; sceptical, as Horace Walpole's Richard III., Laing's Dissertation
on Perkin Warbeck, or on the Gowrie Conspiracy, which expressly undertakes to probe and try
the unsound parts of the story; and critical, which, after an examination of this nature, selects
from the whole body of materials such as are coherent. There is besides another ground of difference
in the quality of historical narratives, viz. between those which move by means of great public
events, and those which (like the Caesars of Suetonius, and the French Memoirs), referring
to such events as are already known, and keeping them in the background, crowd their foreground
with those personal and domestic notices which we call anecdotes.

NOTE 2.

Leibnitz, (who was twice in England,) when walking in Kensington Gardens with the Princess
of Wales, whose admiration oscillated between this great countryman of her own, and Sir Isaac
Newton, the corresponding idol of her adopted country, took occasion, from the beautiful scene
about them, to explain in a lively way, and at the same time to illustrate and verify this
favorite thesis: Turning to a gentleman in attendance upon her Royal Highness, he challenged
him to produce two leaves from any tree or shrub, which should be exact duplicates or facsimiles
of each other in those lines which variegate the surface. The challenge was accepted; but the
result justified Leibnitz. It is in fact upon this infinite variety in the superficial lines
of the human palm, that Palmistry is grounded, (or the science of divination by the hieroglyphics
written on each man's hand,) and has its prima facie justification. Were it otherwise, this
mode of divination would not have even a plausible sanction; for, without the inexhaustible
varieties which are actually found in the combinations of these lines, and which give to each
separate individual his own separate type, the same identical fortunes must be often repeated;
and there would be no foundation for assigning to each his peculiar and characteristic destiny.

NOTE 3.

According to the general estimate of philosophical history, the tenth century (or perhaps the
tenth and the eleventh conjointly) must be regarded as the meridian, or the perfect midnight,

NOTE 4.

It has repeatedly been made a question--at what era we are to date the transition from ancient
to modern history. This question merits a separate dissertation. Meantime it is sufficient
to say in this place--that Justinian in the 6th century will unanimously be referred to the
ancient division, Charlemagne in the 8th to the modern. These then are two limits fixed in
each direction; and somewhere between them must lie the frontier line. Now the era of Mahomet
in the 7th century is evidently the exact and perfect line of demarcation; not only as pretty
nearly bisecting the debatable ground, but also because the rise of the Mohammedan power, as
operating so powerfully upon the Christian kingdoms of the south, and through them upon the
whole of Christendom, at that time beginning to mould themselves and to knit, marks in the
most eminent sense the birth of a new era.

Or, in fact, than is likely to manifest itself to an unlearned reader of Mr. James's own book;

of research.

Not having the French original of Bourrienne's work, we are compelled to quote from Dr. Memes's
translation, which, however, is everywhere incorrect, and in a degree absolutely astonishing;
and, where not incorrect, offensive from vulgarisms or ludicrous expressions. Thus, he translates
un drole, a droll fellow--wide as the poles from the true meaning, Again, the verb devoir,
in all tenses, that eternal stumbling-block to bad French scholars, is uniformly mistranslated.
As an instance of ignoble language, at p. 294, vol. I., he says, 'Josephine was delighted with
the disposition of her goodman,' a word used only by underbred people. But of all the absurdities
which disfigure the work, what follows is perhaps the most striking:--'Kleber,' he says, 'took
a precognition of the army,' p. 231, vol. I. A precognition! What Pagan ceremony may that be?
Know, reader, that this monster of a word is a technical term of Scotch law; and even to the
Scotch, excepting those few who know a little of law, absolutely unintelligible. In speaking
thus harshly, we are far from meaning any thing unkind to Dr. M., whom, on the contrary, for
his honorable sentiments in relation to the merits of Bonaparte, we greatly respect. But that
as nothing to do with French translation--the condition of which, in this country, is perfectly
scandalous.

NOTE 8.

Some people may fancy that this scene of that day's drama was got up merely to save appearances
by a semblance of discussion, and that in effect it mattered not how the performance was conducted
where all was scenical, and the ultimate reliance, after all, on the bayonet. But it is certain
that this view is erroneous, and that the final decision of the soldiery, even up to the very
moment of the crisis, was still doubtful. Some time after this exhibition, 'the hesitation
reigning among the troops,' says Bourrienne, 'still continued.' And in reality it was a mere
accident of pantomime, and a clap-trap of sentiment, which finally gave a sudden turn in Napoleon's
favor to their wavering resolutions.

NOTE 9.

We have occasionally such expressions as--'When wild in woods the noble savage ran.' These
descriptions rest upon false conceptions; in fact, no such combination anywhere exists as a
man having the training of a savage, or occupying the exposed and naked situation of a savage,
who is at the same time in any moral sense at liberty to be noble-minded. Men are moulded by
the circumstances in which they stand habitually; and the insecurity of savage life, by making
it impossible to forego any sort of advantages, obliterates the very idea of honor. Hence,
with all savages alike, the point of honor lies in treachery--in stratagem--and the utmost
excess of what is dishonorable, according to the estimate of cultivated man.

NOTE 12.

It is painful to any man of honorable feelings that, whilst a great rival nation is pursuing
the ennobling profession of arms, his own should be reproached contemptuously with a sordid
dedication to commerce. However, on the one hand, things are not always as they seem; commerce
has its ennobling effects, direct or indirect; war its barbarizing degradations. And, on the
other hand, the facts even are not exactly as prima facie they were supposed; for the truth
is, that, in proportion to its total population, England had more men in arms during the last
war than France. But, generally speaking, the case may be stated thus: the British nation is,
by original constitution of mind, and by long enjoyment of liberty, a far nobler people than
the French. And hence we see the reason and necessity that the French should, with a view to
something like a final balance in the effect, be trained to a nobler profession. Compensations
are every where produced or encouraged by nature and by Providence; and a nobler discipline
in the one nation is doubtless some equilibrium to a nobler nature in the other.

NOTE 13.

In council, we say purposely and in candor; for the only pleas in palliation ever set up by
Napoleon's apologists, are these two--necessity, the devil's plea, in the first place; secondly,
that the guilt of the transaction, whether more or less, was divided between the general and
his council.

NOTE 14.

And from the fact of that corps in Charlemagne's army, which effected the passage, having been
commanded by his uncle, Duke Bernard, this mountain previously known as the Mons Jovis, (and,
by corruption, Mont le Joux,) very justly obtained the name which it still retains.

MODERN GREECE.

'Journal of a Tour in Greece and the Ionian Islands.' By WILLIAM MURE, of Caldwell.

[1842.]

What are the nuisances, special to Greece, which repel tourists from that country? They are
three;--robbers, fleas, and dogs. It is remarkable that all are, in one sense, respectable
nuisances--they are ancient, and of classical descent. The monuments still existing from pre-Christian
ages, in memory of honest travellers assassinated by brigands of klephts, (Kleptai,) show that
the old respectable calling of freebooters by sea and land, which Thucydides, in a well-known
passage, describes as so reputable an investment for capital during the times preceding his
own, and, as to northern Greece, even during his own, had never entirely languished, as with
us it has done, for two generations, on the heaths of Bagshot, Hounslow, or Finchley. Well
situated as these grounds were for doing business, lying at such convenient distances from
the metropolis, and studying the convenience of all parties, (since, if a man were destined
to lose a burden on his road, surely it was pleasing to his feelings that he had not been suffered
to act as porter over ninety or a hundred miles, in the service of one who would neither pay
him nor thank him); yet, finally, what through banks, and what through policemen, the concern
has dwindled to nothing. In England, we believe, this concern was technically known amongst
men of business and 'family men,' as the 'Low Toby.' In Greece it was called [Greek: laeseia];
and Homericaliy speaking, it was perhaps the only profession thoroughly respectable. A few
other callings are mentioned in the Odyssey as furnishing regular bread to decent men--viz.
the doctor's, the fortune-teller's or conjurer's, and the armorer's. Indeed it is clear, from
the offer made to Ulysses of a job, in the way of hedging and ditching, that sturdy big-boned
beggars, or what used to be called 'Abraham men' in southern England, were not held to have
forfeited any heraldic dignity attached to the rank of pauper, (which was considerable,) by
taking a farmer's pay where mendicancy happened to be 'looking downwards.' Even honest labor
was tolerated, though, of course, disgraceful. But the Corinthian order of society, to borrow
Burke's image, was the bold sea-rover, the buccaneer, or, (if you will call him so) the robber
in all his varieties. Titles were, at that time, not much in use--honorary titles we mean;
but had our prefix of 'Right Honorable' existed, it would have been assigned to burglars, and
by no means to privy-councillors; as again our English prefix of 'Venerable' would have been
settled, not on so sheepish a character as the archdeacon, but on the spirited appropriator
of church plate. We were surprised lately to find, in a German work of some authority, so gross
a misconception of Thucydides, as that of supposing him to be in jest. Nothing of the sort.
The question which he represents as once current, on speaking a ship in the Mediterranean--'Pray,
gentlemen, are you robbers?' actually occurs in Homer; and to Homer, no doubt, the historian
alludes. It neither was, nor could be conceived, as other than complimentary; for the alternative
supposition presumed him that mean and well-known character--the merchant, who basely paid
for what he took. It was plainly asking--Are you a knight grand-cross of some martial order,
or a sort of costermonger? And we give it as no hasty or fanciful opinion, that the South Sea
islands (which Bougainville held to be in a state of considerable civilization) had, in fact,
reached the precise stage of Homeric Greece. The power of levying war, as yet not sequestered
by the ruling power of each community, was a private right inherent in every individual of
any one state against all individuals of any other. Captain Cook's ship, the Resolution, and
her consort, the Adventure, were as much independent states and objects of lawful war to the
islanders, as Owyhee, in the Sandwich group, was to Tongataboo in the Friendly group. So that
to have taken an Old Bailey view of the thefts committed was unjust, and, besides, inefectual;
the true remedy being by way of treaty or convention with the chiefs of every island. And perhaps,
if Homer had tried it, the same remedy (in effect, regular payments of black-mail) might have
been found available in his day.

It is too late to suggest that idea now. The princely pirates are gone; and the last dividend
has been paid upon their booty; so that, whether he gained or lost by them, Homer's estate
is not liable to any future inquisitions from commissioners of bankruptcy or other sharks.
He, whether amongst the plundered, or, as is more probable, a considerable shareholder in the
joint-stock privateers from Tenedos, &c., is safe both from further funding and refunding.
We are not. And the first question of moment to any future tourist is, what may be the present
value, at a British insurance office, of any given life risked upon a tour in Greece? Much
will, of course, depend upon the extent and the particular route. A late prime minister of
Greece, under the reigning king Otho, actually perished by means of one day's pleasure excursion
from Athens, though meeting neither thief nor robber. He lost his way: and this being scandalous
in an ex-chancellor of the exchequer having ladies under his guidance, who were obliged, like
those in the Midsummer Night's Dream, to pass the night, in an Athenian wood, his excellency
died of vexation. Where may not men find a death? But we ask after the calculation of any office
which takes extra risks: and, as a basis for such a calculation, we submit the range of tour
sketched by Pausanius, more than sixteen centuries back--that [Greek: Pansapachae periodos],
as Colonel Leake describes it, which carries a man through the heart of all that can chiefly
interest in Greece. Where are the chances upon such a compass of Greek travelling, having only
the ordinary escort and arms, or having no arms, (which the learned agree in thinking the safer
plan at present,) that a given traveller will revisit the glimpses of an English moon, or again
embrace his 'placens uxor?' As with regard to Ireland, it is one stock trick of Whiggery to
treat the chances of assassination in the light of an English hypochondriacal chimaera, so
for a different reason it has been with regard to Italy, and soon will be for Greece. Twenty
years ago it was a fine subject for jesting--the English idea of stilettos in Rome, and masqued
bravos, and assassins who charged so much an inch for the depth of their wounds. But all the
laughter did not save a youthful English marriage party from being atrociously massacred; a
grave English professional man with his wife from being carried off to a mountainous captivity,
and reserved from slaughter only by the prospect of ransom; a British nobleman's son from death
or the consequences of Italian barbarity; or a prince, the brother of Napoleon, from having
the security of his mansion violated, and the most valuable captives carried off by daylight
from his household. In Greece apparently the state of things is worse, because absolutely worse
under a far slighter temptation. But Mr. Mure is of opinion that Greek robbers have private
reasons as yet for sparing English tourists.

So far then is certain: viz. that the positive danger is greater in poverty-stricken Greece
than in rich and splendid Italy. But as to the valuation of the danger, it is probably as yet
imperfect from mere defect of experience: the total amount of travellers is unknown. And it
may be argued that at least Colonel Leake, Mr. Dodwell, and our present Mr. Mure, with as many
more as have written books, cannot be among the killed, wounded, or missing. There is evidence
in octavo that they are yet 'to the fore.' Still with respect to books, after all, they may
have been posthumous works: or, to put the case in another form, who knows how many excellent
works in medium quarto, not less than crown octavo, may have been suppressed and intercepted
in their rudiments by these expurgatorial ruffians? Mr. Mure mentions as the exquisite reason
for the present fashion of shooting from an ambush first, and settling accounts afterwards,
that by this means they evade the chances of a contest. The Greek robber, it seems, knows as
well as Cicero that 'non semper viator a latrone, nonnunquam etiam latro a viatore occiditur'--a
disappointment that makes one laugh exceedingly. Now this rule as to armed travellers is likely
to bear hard upon our countrymen, who being rich, (else how come they in Greece?) will surely
be brilliantly armed; and thus again it may be said, in a sense somewhat different from Juvenal's--

   Et vacuus cantat coram latrone viator;

Vacuus not of money, but of pistols. Yet on the other hand, though possibly sound law for the
thickets of Mount Cithaeron, this would be too unsafe a policy as a general rule: too often
it is the exposure of a helpless exterior which first suggests the outrage. And perhaps the
best suggestion for the present would be, that travellers should carry in their hands an apparent
telescope or a reputed walking-cane; which peaceful and natural part of his appointments will
first operate to draw out his lurking forest friend from his advantage; and on closer colloquy,
if this friend should turn restive, then the 'Tuscan artist's tube,' contrived of course a
double debt to pay, will suddenly reveal another sort of tube, insinuating an argument sufficient
for the refutation of any sophism whatever. This is the best compromise which we can put forward
with the present dilemma in Greece, where it seems that to be armed or to be unarmed is almost
equally perilous. But our secret opinion is, that in all countries alike, the only absolute
safeguard against highway robbery is--a railway; for then the tables are turned; not he who
is stopped--incurs the risk, but he who stops: we question whether Samson himself could have
pulled up his namesake on the Liverpool railway. Recently, indeed, in the Court of Common Pleas,
on a motion to show cause by Sergeant Bompas, in Hewitt v. Price, Tindal (Chief-Justice) said--'We
cannot call a railway a public [Footnote 1] security, I think,' (laughter:) but we think otherwise.
In spite of 'laughter,' we consider it a specific against the Low Toby. And, en attendant,
there is but one step towards amelioration of things for Greece, which lies in summary ejecting
of the Bavarian locusts. Where all offices of profit or honor are engrossed by needy aliens,
you cannot expect a cheerful temper in the people. And, unhappily, from moody discontent in
Greece to the taking of purses is a short transition.

Thus have we disposed of 'St. Nicholas's Clerks.' Next we come to fleas and dogs:--Have we
a remedy for these? We have: but as to fleas, applicable or not, according to the purpose with
which a man travels. If, as happened at times to Mr. Mure, a natural, and, for his readers,
a beneficial anxiety to see something of domestic habits, overcomes all sense of personal inconvenience,
he will wish, at any cost, to sleep in Grecian bedrooms, and to sit by German hearths. On the
other hand, though sensible of the honor attached to being bit by a flea lineally descended
from an Athenian flea that in one day may possibly have bit three such men as Pericles, Phidias,
and Euripides, many quiet unambitious travellers might choose to dispense with 'glory,' and
content themselves with the view of Greek external nature. To these persons we would recommend
the plan of carrying amongst their baggage a tent, with portable camp-beds; one of those, as
originally invented upon the encouragement of the Peninsular campaigns from 1809 to 1814, and
subsequently improved, would meet all ordinary wants. It is objected, indeed, that by this
time the Grecian fleas must have colonized the very hills and woods; as once, we remember,
upon Westminster Bridge, to a person who proposed bathing in the Thames by way of a ready ablution
from the July dust, another replied, 'My dear sir, by no means; the river itself is dusty.
Consider what it is to have received the dust of London for nineteen hundred years since Caesar's
invasion.' But in any case the water cups, in which the bed-posts rest, forbid the transit
of creatures not able to swim or to fly. A flea indeed leaps; and, by all report, in a way
that far beats a tiger--taking the standard of measurement from the bodies of the competitors.
But even this may be remedied: giving the maximum leap of a normal flea, it is always easy
to raise the bed indefinitely from the ground--space upwards is unlimited--and the supporters
of the bed may be made to meet in one pillar, coated with so viscous a substance as to put
even a flea into chancery.

As to dogs, the case is not so easily settled; and before the reader is in a condition to judge
of our remedy, he ought to know the evil in its whole extent. After all allowances for vermin
that waken you before your time, or assassins that send you to sleep before your time, no single
Greek nuisance can be placed on the same scale with the dogs attached to every menage, whether
household or pastoral. Surely as a stranger approaches to any inhospitable door of the peasantry,
often before he knows of such a door as in rerum natura, out bounds upon him by huge careering
leaps a horrid infuriated ruffian of a dog--oftentimes a huge moloss, big as an English cow--active
as a leopard, fierce as a hyena but more powerful by much, and quite as little disposed to
hear reason. So situated--seeing an enemy in motion with whom it would be as idle to negotiate
as with an earthquake--what is the bravest man to do? Shoot him? Ay; that was pretty much the
course taken by a young man who lived before Troy: and see what came of it. This man, in fact
a boy of seventeen, had walked out to see the city of Mycenae, leaving his elder cousin at
the hotel sipping his wine. Out sprang a huge dog from the principal house in what you might
call the High street of Mycenae; the young man's heart began to palpitate; he was in that state
of excitement which affects most people when fear mingles with excessive anger. What was he
to do? Pistols he had none. And, as nobody came out to his aid, he put his hand to the ground;
seized a chermadion, (or paving-stone), smashed the skull of the odious brute, and with quite
as much merit as Count Robert of Paris was entitled to have claimed from his lucky hit in the
dungeon, then walked off to report his little exploit to his cousin at the hotel. But what
followed? The wretches in the house, who never cared to show themselves so long as it might
only be the dog killing a boy, all came tumbling out by crowds when it became clear that a
boy had killed the dog. 'A la lanterne!' they yelled out; valiantly charged en masse: and among
them they managed to kill the boy. But there was a reckoning to pay for this. Had they known
who it was that sat drinking at the hotel, they would have thought twice before they backed
their brute. That cousin, whom the poor boy had left at his wine, happened to be an ugly customer--Hercules
incog. It is needless to specify the result. The child unborn had reason to rue the murder
of the boy. For his cousin proved quite as deaf to all argument or submission as their own
foul thief of a dog or themselves. Suffice it--that the royal house of Mycenae, in the language
of Napoleon's edicts, ceased to reign. But here is the evil; few men leave a Hercules at their
hotel; and all will have to stand the vindictive fury of the natives for their canine friends,
if you should pistol them. Be it in deliverance of your own life, or even of a lady's by your
side, no apology would be listened to. In fact, besides the disproportionate annoyance to a
traveller's nerves, that he shall be kept uneasy at every turn of the road in mere anxiety
as to the next recurrence of struggles so desperate, it arms the indignation of a bold Briton
beforehand--that a horrid brute shall be thought entitled to kill him; and if he does, it is
pronounced an accident: but if he, a son of the mighty island, kills the brute, instantly a
little hybrid Greek peasant shall treat it as murder.

Many years ago, we experienced the selfsame annoyance in the north of England. Let no man talk
of courage in such cases. Most justly did Marechal Saxe ask an officer sneeringly, who protested
that he had never known the sensation of fear, and could not well imagine what it was like,
had he never snuffed a candle with his fingers? 'because in that case,' said the veteran, 'I
fancy you must have felt afraid of burning your thumb.' A brave man, on a service of known
danger, braces up his mind by a distinct effort to the necessities of his duty. The great sentiment
that it is his duty, the sentiments of honor and of country, reconcile him to the service while
it lasts. No use, besides, in ducking before shot, or dodging, or skulking; he that faces the
storm most cheerfully, has after all the best chance of escaping--were that the object of consideration.
But, as soon as this trial is over, and the energy called forth by a high tension of duty has
relaxed, the very same man often shrinks from ordinary trials of his prowess. Having, perhaps,
little reason for confidence in his own bodily strength, seeing no honor in the struggle, and
sure that no duty would be hallowed by any result, he shrinks from it in a way which surprises
those who have heard of his martial character. Brave men in extremities are many times the
most nervous, and the shyest under perils of a mean order. We, without claiming the benefit
of these particular distinctions, happened to be specially 'soft' on this one danger from dogs.
Not from the mere terror of a bite, but from the shocking doubt besieging such a case for four
or five months that hydrophobia may supervene. Think, excellent reader, if we should suddenly
prove hydrophobous in the middle of this paper, how would you distinguish the hydrophobous
from the non-hydrophobous parts? You would say, as Voltaire of Rousseau, 'sa plume apparemment
brulera le papier.' Such being the horror ever before our mind, images of eyeballs starting
from their sockets, spasms suffocating the throat--we could not see a dog starting off into
a yell of sudden discovery bound for the foot of our legs, but that undoubtedly a mixed sensation
of panic and fury overshadowed us; a [Greek: Chermadion] was not always at hand; and without
practice we could have little confidence in our power of sending it home, else many is the
head we should have crushed. Sometimes, where more than one dog happened to be accomplices
in the outrage, we were not altogether out of danger. 'Euripides,' we said, 'was really torn
to pieces by the dogs of a sovereign prince; in Hounslow, but a month since, a little girl
was all but worried by the buck-hounds of a greater sovereign than Archelaus; and why not we
by the dogs of a farmer?' The scene lay in Westmorland and Cumberland. Oftentimes it would
happen that in summer we had turned aside from the road, or perhaps the road itself forced
us to pass a farm-house from which the family might be absent in the hayfield. Unhappily the
dogs in such a case are often left behind. And many have been the fierce contests in which
we have embarked; for, as to retreating, be it known that there (as in Greece) the murderous
savages will pursue you--sometimes far into the high road. That result it was which uniformly
brought us back to a sense of our own wrong, and finally of our rights. 'Come,' we used to
say, 'this is too much; here at least is the king's highway, and things are come to a pretty
pass indeed, if we, who partake of a common nature with the king, and write good Latin, whereas
all the world knows what sort of Latin is found among dogs, may not have as good a right to
standing-room as a low-bred quadruped with a tail like you.' Non usque adeo summis permiscuit
ima longa dies, &c. We remember no instance which ever so powerfully illustrated the courage
given by the consciousness of rectitude. So long as we felt that we were trespassing on the
grounds of a stranger, we certainly sneaked, we seek not to deny it. But once landed on the
high-road, where we knew our own title to be as good as the dog's, not all the world should
have persuaded us to budge one foot.

Our reason for going back to these old Cumbrian remembrances will be found in what follows.
Deeply incensed at the insults we had been obliged to put up with for years, brooding oftentimes
over

  'Wrongs unredress'd, and insults unaveng'd,'

we asked ourselves--Is vengeance hopeless? And at length we hit upon the following scheme of
retribution. This it is which we propose as applicable to Greece. Well acquainted with the
indomitable spirit of the bull-dog, and the fidelity of the mastiff, we determined to obtain
two such companions; to re-traverse our old ground; to make a point of visiting every house
where we had been grossly insulted by dogs; and to commit our cause to the management of these
new allies. 'Let us see,' said we, 'if they will speak in the same bullying tone this time.'
'But with what ulterior views?' the dispassionate reader asks. The same, we answer, which Mr.
Pitt professed as the objects of the Revolutionary war--'Indemnity for the past, and security
for the future.' Years, however, passed on; Charles X. fell from his throne; the Reform Bill
passed; other things occurred, and as last this change struck us--that the dogs, on whom our
vengeance would alight, generally speaking, must belong to a second generation, or even a third,
in descent from our personal enemies. Now, this vengeance 'by procuration' seemed no vengeance
at all. But a plan which failed, as regarded our own past wrongs, may yet apply admirably to
a wrong current and in progress. If we Englishmen may not pistol Greek canine ruffians, at
any rate we suppose an English bulldog has a right to make a tour in Greece, A mastiff, if
he pays for his food and lodgings, possesses as good a title, to see Athens and the Peloponnesus
as a Bavarian, and a better than a Turk; and, if he cannot be suffered to pass quietly along
the roads on his own private affairs, the more is the pity. But assuredly the consequences
will not fall on him; we know enough of the sublime courage bestowed on that heroic animal,
to be satisfied that he will shake the life out of any enemy that Greece can show. The embassy
sent by Napoleon to the Schah of Persia about the year 1810, complained much and often of the
huge dogs scattered over all parts of Western Asia, whether Turkish or Persian; and, by later
travels amongst the Himalayas, it seems that the same gigantic ruffians prevail in Central
Asia. But the noble English bull-dogs, who, being but three in number, did not hesitate for
one instant to rush upon the enormous lion at Warwick, will face any enemy in the world, and
will come off victors, unless hyperbolically overweighted; a peril which need not be apprehended,
except perhaps in Laconia or Messenia.

Here, therefore, we should be disposed to leave the subject. But, as it is curious for itself,
is confessedly of importance to the traveller, and has thrown light upon a passage in the Odyssey
that had previously been unintelligible--we go on to one other suggestion furnished by the
author before us. It is really a discovery; and is more worthy of a place in annotations upon
Homer than nine in ten of all that we read;--

'Among the numerous points of resemblance with which the classical traveller cannot fail to
be struck, between the habits of pastoral and agricultural life as still exemplified in Greece,
and those which formerly prevailed in the same country, there is none more calculated to arrest
his attention than the correspondence of the shepherds' encampments, scattered on the face
of the less cultivated districts, with the settlements of the same kind whose concerns are
so frequently brought forward in the imagery of the Iliad and Odyssey. Accordingly, the passage
of Homer to which the existing peculiarity above described,' (viz. of pelting off dogs by large
jagged stones,) 'affords the-most appropriate commentary, is the scene where Ulysses, disguised
as a beggar, in approaching the farm of the swineherd, is fiercely assaulted by the dogs, but
delivered by the master of the establishment. Pope's translation, with the exception of one
or two expressions,' (amongst which Mr. Mure notices mastiff as "not a good term for a sheep-dog,")
'here conveys with tolerable fidelity the spirit of the original:--

  '"Soon as Ulysses near the enclosure drew,
    With open mouths the furious mastiffs flew;
    Down sate the sage; and, cautious to withstand,
    Let fall the offensive truncheon from his hand.
    Sudden the master runs--aloud he calls;
    And from his hasty hand the leather falls;
    With show'rs of stones he drives them far away;
    The scatter'd dogs around at distance bay."'
    ODYSS. xiv. 29.

First, however, let us state the personal adventure which occasions this reference to Homer,
as it illustrates a feature in Greek scenery, and in the composition of Greek society. In the
early part of his travels, on a day when Mr. Mure was within a few hours of the immortal Mesolonghi,
he (as better mounted) had ridden a-head of his suite. Suddenly he came upon 'an encampment
of small, low, reed wigwams,' which in form resembled 'the pastoral capanne of the Roman plain;'
but were 'vastly inferior in size and structure.' Women and children were sitting outside:
but finally there crawled forth from the little miserable hovels two or three male figures
of such gigantic dimensions as seemed beyond the capacity of the entire dwellings. Several
others joined them, all remarkable for size and beauty. And one, whose air of authority bespoke
his real rank of chief, Mr. Mure pronounces 'a most magnificent-looking barbarian,' This was
a nomad tribe of Wallachian shepherds, descended (it is supposed) from the Dacian colonies,
Romans intermingled with natives, founded by the later Caesars; the prevalent features of their
faces are, it seems, Italian; their language is powerfully veined with Latin; their dress differing
from that of all their Albanian neighbors, resembles the dress of Dacian captives sculptured
on the triumphal monuments of Rome; and lastly, their peculiar name, Vlack Wallachian, indicates
in the Sclavonic language pretty much the same relation to a foreign origin, as in German is
indicated by the word Welsh: an affinity of which word is said to exist in our word Walnut,
where wall (as the late Mr. Coleridge thinks) means alien, outlandish. The evidence therefore
is as direct for their non-Grecian descent as could be desired. But they are interesting to
Greece at this time, because annually migrating from Thessaly in the summer, and diffusing
themselves in the patriarchal style with their wives, their children, and their flocks, over
the sunny vales of Boeotia, of Peloponnesus, and in general of southern Greece. Their men are
huge, but they are the mildest of the human race. Their dogs are huge, also; so far the parallel
holds. We regret that strict regard to truth forbids us to pursue the comparison.

'I found myself on a sudden,' says Mr. Mure, 'surrounded by a fierce pack of dogs, of size
proportioned to that of their masters, and which rushed forth on every side as if bent on devouring
both myself and beast: being altogether unprovided with any means of defence but the rope-end
of the same halter that supplied my stirrups, I was (I confess) not a little disconcerted by
the assault of so unexpected an enemy.' From this he was soon delivered at the moment by some
of the gentle giants, who 'pelted off the animals with the large loose stones that lay scattered
over the rocky surface of the heath.' But upon the character of the nuisance, and upon the
particular remedy employed--both of which are classical, and older than Troy, Mr. Mure makes
the following explanations:--

'The number and ferocity of the dogs that guard the Greek hamlets and sheepfolds, as compared
with those kept for similar purposes in other parts of the world, is one of the peculiarities
of this country which not only first attracts the attention of the tourist, but is chiefly
calculated to excite his alarm, and call into exercise his prowess or presence of mind. It
is also amongst the features of modern Greek life that supply the most curious illustrations
of classical antiquity. Their attacks are not confined to those who approach the premises of
which they are the appointed guardians;' they do not limit themselves to defensive war: 'in
many districts they are in the habit of rushing from a considerable distance to torment the
traveller passing along the public track; and when the pastoral colonies, as is often the case,
occur at frequent intervals, the nuisance becomes quite intolerable.' But in cases where the
succession is less continuous, we should imagine that the nuisance was in the same proportion
more dangerous; and Mr. Mure acknowledges--that under certain circumstances, to a solitary
stranger the risk would be serious; though generally, and in the case of cavalcades, the dogs
fasten chiefly upon the horses. But endless are the compensations which we find in the distributions
of nature. Is there a bane? Near it lies an antidote. Is there a disease? Look for a specific
in that same neighborhood. Here, also, the universal rule prevails. As it was destined that
Greece in all ages should be scourged by this intestine enemy, it was provided that a twofold
specific should travel concurrently with the evil. And because the vegetable specific, in the
shape of oaken cudgels, was liable to local failure, (at this moment, in fact, from the wreck
of her woods by means of incendiary armies, Greece is, for a season, disafforested,) there
exists a second specific of a mineral character, which (please Heaven?) shall never fail, so
long as Greece is Greece. 'The usual weapons of defence, employed in such cases by the natives,
are the large loose stones with which the soil is everywhere strewed--a natural feature of
this region, to which also belongs its own proper share of classic interest.' The character
of the rocks prevailing in those mountain ridges which intersect the whole of Greece is, that
whilst in its interior texture 'of iron-hard consistency,' yet at the surface it is 'broken
into detached fragments of infinitely varied dimensions.' Balls, bullets, grape, and canister
shot, have all been 'parked' in inexhaustible magazines; whilst the leading feature which strikes
the mind with amazement in this natural artillery, is its fine retail distribution. Everywhere
you may meet an enemy: stoop, and everywhere there is shot piled for use. We see a Leibnitzian
preestablished harmony between the character of the stratification and the character of the
dogs. Cardinal de Retz explains why that war, in the minority of Louis XIV., was called the
Fronde; and it seems that in Greece, where an immortal fronde was inevitable, an immortal magazine
was supplied for it--one which has been and will continue to be, under all revolutions, for
the uncultured tracts present the missiles equally diffused; and the first rudiments of culture
show themselves in collections of these missiles along the roads. Hence, in fact, a general
mistake of tourists. 'It is certain,' says Mr. Mure, 'that many of the circular mounds, which
are noticed in the itineraries under the rubric of ancient tumulus, have been heaped up in
this manner. It is to these stones that travellers, and the population at large instinctively
have recourse, as the most effectual weapon against the assaults of the dogs.' The small shot
of pebbles, however, or even stones equal to pigeon's eggs, would avail nothing: 'those selected
are seldom smaller than a man, exerting his whole force, can conveniently lift and throw with
one hand.' Thence, in fact, and from no other cause, comes (as Mr. Mure observes) the Homeric
designation of such stones, viz. chermadion, or handful; of which he also cites the definition
given by Lucian, [Greek text: lithos cheiroplaethaes], a hand-filling stone. Ninety generations
have passed since the Trojan war, and each of the ninety has used the same bountiful magazine.
All readers of the Iliad must remember how often Ajax or Hector, took up chermadia, 'such as
twice five men in our degenerate days could barely lift,' launching them at light-armed foes,
who positively would not come nearer to take their just share of the sword or spear. 'The weapon
is the more effectual, owing to the nature of the rock itself, broken as it is in its whole
surface into angular and sharp-pointed inequalities, which add greatly to the severity of the
wound inflicted. Hence, as most travellers will have experienced, a fall amongst the Greek
rocks is unusually painful.' It is pleasing to find Homer familiar not only with the use of
the weapon, but with its finest external 'developments.' Not only the stone must be a bouncer,
a chermadion, with some of the properties (we believe) marking a good cricket-ball, but it
ought to be [Greek Text: ochxioeis]--such is the Homeric epithet of endearment, his caressing
description of a good brainer, viz. splinting-jagged.

This fact of the chermadic weight attached to the good war-stone explains, as Mr. Mure ingeniously
remarks, a simile of Homer's, which ought to have been pure nonsense for Pope and Cowper; viz.
that in describing a dense mist, such as we foolishly imagine peculiar to our own British climate,
and meaning to say that a man could scarcely descry an object somewhat ahead of his own station,
he says, [Greek Text: tosson tis t'ep leussel oson t'epi laan iaesi]: so far does man see as
lie hurls a stone. Now, in the skirmish of 'bickering,' this would argue no great limitation
of eyesight. 'Why, man, how far would you see? Would you see round a corner?' 'A shot of several
hundred yards,' says Mr. Mure, 'were no great feat for a country lad well skilled in the art
of stone-throwing.' But this is not Homer's meaning--'The cloud of dust' (which went before
an army advancing, and which it is that Homer compares to a mist on the hills perplexing the
shepherd) 'was certainly much denser than to admit of the view extending to such a distance.
In the Homeric sense, as allusive to the hurling of the ponderous chermadion, the figure is
correct and expressive.' And here, as everywhere, we see the Horatian parenthesis upon Homer,
as one, qui nil molitur inepte, who never speaks vaguely, never wants a reason, and never loses
sight of a reality, amply sustained. Here, then, is a local resource to the British tourist
besides the imported one of the bull-dog. And it is remarkable that, except where the dogs
are preternaturally audacious, a mere hint of the chermadion suffices. Late in our own experience
too late for glory, we made the discovery that all dogs have a mysterious reverence for a trundling
stone. It calls off attention from the human object, and strikes alarm into the caitiff's mind.
He thinks the stone alive. Upon this hint we thought it possible to improve: stooping down,
we 'made believe' to launch a stone, when, in fact, we had none; and the effect generally followed.
So well is this understood in Greece that, according to a popular opinion reported by Mr. Mure,
the prevailing habit in Grecian dogs, as well as bitches, of absenting themselves from church,
grows out of the frequent bowing and genuflexions practised in the course of the service. The
congregation, one and all, simultaneously stoop; the dog's wickedness has made him well acquainted
with the meaning of that act; it is a symbol but too significant to his conscience; and he
takes to his heels with the belief that a whole salvo of one hundred and one chermadia are
fastening on his devoted 'hurdies.'

Here, therefore, is a suggestion at once practically useful, and which furnishes more than
one important elucidation to passages in Homer hitherto unintelligible. For the sake of one
other such passage, we shall, before dismissing the subject, pause upon a novel fact, communicated
by Mr. Mure, which is equally seasonable as a new Homeric light, and as a serviceable hint
in a situation of extremity.

In the passage already quoted under Pope's version from Odyssey, xiv. Dampier mentions a case
which he witnessed in some island with a Malay population, where a herd of buffaloes continued
to describe concentric circles, by continually narrowing around a party of sailors; and at
last submitted only to the control of children not too far beyond the state of infancy. The
white breed of wild cattle, once so well known at Lord Tankerville's in Northumberland, and
at one point in the south-west of Scotland, had a similar instinct for regulating the fury
of their own attack; but it was understood that when the final circle had been woven, the spell
was perfect; and that the herd would 'do business' most effectually. As respects the Homeric
case, 'I,' (says Mr. Mure,) 'am probably not the only reader who has been puzzled to understand
the object of this manoeuvre' (the sitting down) 'on the part of the hero. I was first led
to appreciate its full value in the following manner:--At Argos one evening, at the table of
General Gordon,' (then commanding-in-chief throughout the Morea, and the best historian of
the Greek revolution, but who subsequently resigned, and died in the spring of 1841, at his
seat in Aberdeenshire,) 'the conversation happened to turn, as it frequently does where tourists
are in company, on this very subject of the number and fierceness of the Grecian dogs; when
one of the company remarked that he knew of a very simple expedient for appeasing their fury.
Happening on a journey to miss his road, and being overtaken by darkness, he sought refuge
for the night at a pastoral settlement by the wayside. As he approached, the dogs rushed out
upon him; and the consequences might have been serious had he not been rescued by an old shepherd,
(the Eumeus of the fold,) who after pelting off his assailants, gave him a hospitable reception
in his hut. The guest made some remark on the zeal of his dogs, and on the danger to which
he had been exposed from their attack. The old man replied 'that it was his own fault, from
not taking the customary precaution in such an emergency; that he ought to have stopped, and
sate down until some person came to protect him.' Here we have the very act of Ulysses; with
the necessary circumstance that he laid aside his arms; after which the two parties were under
a provisional treaty. And Adam Smith's doubtful assumption that dogs are incapable of exchange,
or reciprocal understanding, seems still more doubtful. As this expedient was new to the traveller,
'he made some further inquiries; and was assured that, if any person in such a predicament
will simply seat himself on the ground, laying aside his weapon of defence, the dogs will also
squat in a circle round him; that, as long as he remains quiet, they will follow his example;
but that, as soon as he rises and moves forward, they will renew their assault. This story,
though told without the least reference to the Odyssey, at once brought home to my own mind
the scene at the fold of Eumeus with the most vivid reality. The existence of the custom was
confirmed by other persons present, from their own observation or experience.' Yet, what if
the night were such as is often found even in Southern Greece during winter--a black frost;
and that all the belligerents were found in the morning symmetrically grouped as petrifactions?
However, here again we have the Homer qui nil molitur inepte, who addressed a people of known
habits. Yet quare--as a matter of some moment for Homeric disputes--were these habits of Ionian
colonies, or exclusively of Greece Proper?

But enough of the repulsive features in Greek travelling. We, for our part, have endeavored
to meet them with remedies both good and novel. Now let us turn to a different question. What
are the positive attractions of Greece? What motives are there to a tour so costly? What are
the Pros, supposing the Cons dismissed? This is a more difficult question than is imagined:
so difficult that most people set out without waiting for the answer: they travel first and
leave to providential contingencies the chance that, on a review of the tour in its course,
some adequate motive may suggest itself. Certainly it may be said, that the word Greece already
in itself contains an adequate motive; and we do not deny that a young man, full of animal
ardor and high classical recollections, may, without blame, give way to the mere instincts
of wandering. It is a fine thing to bundle up your traps at an hour's warning, and fixing your
eye upon some bright particular star, to say--'I will travel after thee: I will have no other
mark: I will chase thy rising or thy setting: that is, on Mr. Wordsworth's hint derived from
a Scottish lake, to move on a general object of stepping westwards, or stepping eastwards.
But there are few men qualified to travel, who stand in this free 'unhoused' condition of license
to spend money, to lose time, or to court peril. In balancing the pretensions of different
regions to a distinction so costly as an effectual tour, money it is, simply the consideration
of cost, which furnishes the chief or sole ground of administration; having but 100 pounds
sterling disposable in any one summer, a man finds his field of choice circumscribed at once:
and rare is the household that can allow twice that sum annually. He contents himself with
the Rhine, or possibly, if more adventurous, he may explore the passes of the Pyrenees; he
may unthread the mazes of romantic Auvergne, or make a stretch even to the Western Alps of Savoy.

But, for the Mediterranean, and especially for the Levant--these he resigns to richer men;
to those who can command from three to five hundred pounds. And next, having submitted to this
preliminary limitation of radius, he is guided in selecting from what remains by some indistinct
prejudice of his early reading. Many are they in England who start with a blind faith, inherited
from Mrs. Radeliffe's romances, and thousands beside, that, in Southern France or in Italy,
from the Milanese down to the furthest nook of the Sicilies, it is physically impossible for
the tourist to go wrong. And thus it happens, that a spectacle, somewhat painful to good sense,
is annually renewed of confiding households leaving a real Calabria in Montgomeryshire or Devonshire,
for dreary, sunburned flats in Bavaria, in Provence, in Languedoc, or in the 'Legations' of
the Papal territory. 'Vintagers,' at a distance, how romantic a sound! Hops--on the other hand--how
mercenary, nay, how culinary, by the feeling connected with their use, or their taxation! Arcadian
shepherds again, or Sicilian from the 'bank of delicate Galesus,' can these be other than poetic?
The hunter of the Alpine ibex--can he be other than picturesque? A sandalled monk mysteriously
cowled, and in the distance, (but be sure of that!) a band of robbers reposing at noon amidst
some Salvator-Rosa-looking solitudes of Calabria--how often have such elements, semi-consciously
grouped, and flashing upon the indistinct mirrors lighted up by early reading, seduced English
good sense into undertakings terminating in angry disappointment! We acknowledge that the English
are the only nation under this romantic delusion; but so saying, we pronounce a very mixed
censure upon our country. In itself it is certainly a folly, which other nations (Germany excepted)
are not above, but below: a folly which presupposes a most remarkable distinction for our literature,
significant in a high moral degree. The plain truth is--that Southern Europe has no romance
in its household literature; has not an organ for comprehending what it is that we mean by
Radcliffian romance. The old ancestral romance of knightly adventure, the Sangreal, the Round
Table, &c., exists for Southern Europe as an antiquarian subject; or if treated aesthetically,
simply as a subject adapted to the ludicrous. And the secondary romance of our later literature
is to the south unintelligible. No Frenchman, Spaniard, or Italian, at all comprehends the
grand poetic feeling employed and nursed by narrative fictions through the last seventy years
in England, though connected by us with their own supposed scenery.

Generally, in speaking of Southern Europe, it may be affirmed that the idea of heightening
any of the grander passions by association with the shadowy and darker forms of natural scenery,
heaths, mountainous recesses, 'forests drear,' or the sad desolation of a silent sea-shore,
of the desert, or of the ocean, is an idea not developed amongst them, nor capable of combining
with their serious feelings. By the evidence of their literature, viz. of their poetry, their
drama, their novels, it is an interest to which the whole race is deaf and blind. A Frenchman
or an Italian (for the Italian, in many features of Gallic insensibility, will be found ultra-Gallican)
can understand a state in which the moving principle is sympathy with the world of conscience.
Not that his own country will furnish him with any grand exemplification of such an interest;
but, merely as a human being, he cannot escape from a certain degree of human sympathy with
the dread tumults going on in that vast theatre--a conscience-haunted mind. So far he stands
on common ground; but how this mode of shedding terror can borrow any alliance from chapels,
from ruins, from monastic piles, from Inquisition dungeons, inscrutable to human justice, or
dread of confessionals,--all this is unfathomably mysterious to Southern Europe. The Southern
imagination is passively and abjectly dependent on social interests; and these must conform
to modern types. Hence, partly, the reason that only the British travel. The German is generally
too poor. The Frenchman desires nothing but what he finds at home: having Paris at hand, why
should he seek an inferior Paris in distant lands? To an Englishman this demur could seldom
exist. He may think, and, with introductions into the higher modes of aristocratic life, he
may know that London and St. Petersburg are far more magnificent capitals than Paris; but that
will not repel his travelling instincts. A superior London he does not credit or desire; but
what he seeks is not a superior, it is a different, life;--not new degrees of old things, but
new kinds of experience are what he asks. His scale of conception is ampler; whereas, generally,
the Frenchman is absorbed into one ideal. Why else is it, that, after you have allowed for
a few Frenchmen carried of necessity into foreign lands by the diplomatic concerns of so vast
a country, and for a few artists travelling in quest of gain or improvement, we hear of no
French travellers as a class? And why is it that, except as regards Egypt, where there happens
to lurk a secret political object in reversion for France, German literature builds its historic
or antiquarian researches almost exclusively upon English travellers? Our travellers may happen
or not to be professional; but they are never found travelling for professional objects. Some
have been merchants or bankers, many have been ecclesiastics; but neither commercial nor clerical
or religious purposes have furnished any working motive, unless where, as express missionaries,
they have prepared their readers to expect such a bias to their researches. Colonel Leake,
the most accurate of travellers, is a soldier; and in reviewing the field of Marathon, of Plataa,
and others deriving their interest from later wars, he makes a casual use of his soldiership.
Captain Beaufort, again, as a sailor, uses his nautical skill where it is properly called for.
But in the larger proportions of their works, even the professional are not professional; whilst
such is our academic discipline, that all alike are scholars. And in this quality of merit
the author before us holds a distinguished rank. He is no artist, though manifesting the eye
learned in art and in landscape. He is not professionally a soldier; he is so only by that
secondary tie, which, in our island, connects the landed aristocracy with the landed militia;
yet though not, in a technical sense, military, he disputes, with such as are, difficult questions
of Greek martial history. He is no regular agriculturist, yet he conveys a good general impression
of the Greek condition with relation to landed wealth or landed skill, as modified at this
moment by the unfortunate restraints on a soil handed over, in its best parts, by a Turkish
aristocracy that had engrossed them, to a Bavarian that cannot use them. In short, Mr. Mure
is simply a territorial gentleman; elevated enough to have stood a contest for the representation
of a great Scottish county; of general information; and, in particular, he is an excellent
Greek scholar; which latter fact we gather, not from anything we have heard, but from these
three indications meeting together;--1. That his verbal use of Greek, in trying the true meaning
of names, (such as Mycene, the island of Asteris, &c.,) is original as well as accurate. 2.
That his display of reading (not volunteered or selected, but determined by accidents of local
suggestion) is ample. 3. That the frugality of his Greek citations is as remarkable as their
pertinence. He is never tempted into trite references; nor ever allows his page to be encumbered
by more of such learning than is severely needed.

With regard to the general motives for travelling, his for Greece had naturally some relation
to his previous reading; but perhaps an occasional cause, making his true motives operative,
may have been his casual proximity to Greece at starting--for he was then residing in Italy.
Others, however, amongst those qualified to succeed him, wanting this advantage, will desire
some positive objects of a high value, in a tour both difficult as regards hardships, costly,
and too tedious, even with the aids of steam, for those whose starting point is England. These
objects, real or imaginary, in a Greek tour, co-extensive with the new limits of Greek jurisdiction,
let us now review:--

I. The Greek People.--It is with a view to the Greeks personally, the men, women, and children,
who in one sense at least, viz., as occupants of the Greek soil, represent the ancient classical
Greeks, that the traveller will undertake this labor. Representatives in one sense! Why, how
now? are they not such in all senses? Do they not trace their descent from the classical Greeks?'
We are sorry to say not; or in so doubtful a way, that the interest derived from that source
is too languid to sustain itself against the opposing considerations. Some authors have peremptorily
denied that one drop of genuine Grecian blood, transmitted from the countrymen of Pericles,
now flows in the veins of any Greek subject. Falmereyer, the German, is at the head (we believe)
of those who take that view. And many who think Falmereyer in excess, make these unpleasant
concessions; viz., 1st, that in Athens and throughout Attica, where, by special preference,
one would wish to see the Grecian cast of face predominating, there, to a single family almost,
you may affirm all to be Albanian. Well; but what is Albanian? For the Albanian race, as having
its headquarters in regions once undoubtedly occupied by a Greek race. Epirus, for instance,
Acarnania, &c., may still be Grecian by descent: but unfortunately it is not so. The Albanians
are no more Grecian, and notoriously no more represent the old legitimate Greeks, who thumped
the Persians and whom the Romans thumped, than the modern English represent the Britons, or
the modern Lowland Scotch represent the Scoti, of the centuries immediately following the Christian
era. Both English and Lowland Scotch, for the first five centuries after the Christian era,
were ranging the forests of north Germany or of southern Sweden. The men who fought with Caesar,
if now represented at all, are so in Wales, in Cornwall, or other western recesses of the island.
And the Albanians are held to be a Sclavonic race--such at least is the accredited theory;
so that modern Greece is connected with Russia not merely by the bond of a common church, but
also by blood, since the Russian people is the supreme branch of the Sclavonic race. This is
the first concession made which limits any remnant of the true Greek blood to parts of the
ancient Hellas not foremost in general interest, nor most likely to be visited.

A second is, that if any claim to a true Grecian descent does exist extensively, it must be
looked for amongst Mahometan clans, descended from renegades of former days, now confounded
with our Mussulmans ejected from Greece, and living in Thrace, or other regions under the Sultan's
sceptre. But even here the purity of the descent is in the last degree uncertain.

This case is remarkable. From the stationary character of all things in the East, there was
a probability beforehand, that several nations--as in particular, four that we will mention:
the Greeks, the Egyptians, the Persians, the Affghans--should have presented the same purity
of descent, untainted by alien blood, which we find in the children of Ishmael, and the children
of his half-brother the patriarch Isaac. Yet, in that case, where would have been the miraculous
unity of race predicted for these two nations exclusively by the Scriptures? The fact is, the
four nations mentioned have been so profoundly changed by deluges of foreign conquest or foreign
intrusion, that at this day, perhaps, no solitary individual could be found whose ancestral
line had not been confounded with other bloods. The Arabs only, and the Jews, are under no
suspicion of this hybrid mixture. Vast deserts, which insulate one side of the Arabian peninsula;
the sea, which insulates the other sides, have, with other causes, preserved the Arab blood
from all general attaint of its purity. Ceremonies, institutions, awful scruples of conscience,
and through many centuries, misery and legal persecution, have maintained a still more impassable
gulf between the Jews and other races. Spain is the only Christian land where the native blood
was at any time intermingled with the Jewish; and hence one cause for the early vigilance of
the Inquisition in that country more than elsewhere; hence also the horror of a Jewish taint
in the Spanish hidalgo; Judaism masquing itself in Christianity, was so keenly suspected, or
so haughtily disclaimed, simply because so largely it existed. It was, however, under a very
peculiar state of society, that, even during an interval, and in a corner, Jews could have
intermarried with Christians. Generally, the intensity of reciprocated hatred, long oppression
upon the one side, deep degradation upon the other, perpetuated the alienation, had the repulsion
of creeds even relaxed. And hence, at this day, the intense purity of the Jewish blood, though
probably more than six millions of individuals.

But with respect to the Grecians, as no barrier has ever existed between them and any other
[Footnote 3] race than the Turks, and these only in the shape of religious scruples, which
on one side had the highest political temptation to give way, there was no pledge stronger
than individual character, there could be no national or corporate pledge, for the maintenance
of this insulation. As therefore, in many recorded cases, the strongest barrier (viz., that
against Mahometan alliances) is known to have given way, as in other cases innumerable, but
forgotten, it must be presumed to have given way? this inference follows, viz., that if anywhere
the Grecian blood remains in purity, the fact will be entirely without evidence; and for us,
the result will be the same as if the fact had no existence. Simply as a matter of curiosity,
if our own opinion were asked as to the probability, that in any situation, a true-blooded
population yet survives at this day, we should answer that, if anywhere, it will be found in
the most sterile of the Greek islands. Yet, even there the bare probability of such a result
will have been open to many disturbances; and especially if the island happen to be much in
the way of navigators, or the harbors happen to be convenient, or if it happen to furnish a
good stage in a succession of stages, (according to the ancient usages of Mediterranean seamanship),
or if it possessed towns containing accumulations of provisions or other stores, or offered
good watering-places; under any of these endowments, an island might be tempting to pirates,
or to roving adventurers, or to remote overpeopled parts of Italy, Africa, Asia Minor, &c.;
in short, to any vicious city where but one man amongst the poorer classes knew the local invitations
to murderous aggressions. Under so many contingencies operative through so many centuries,
and revolutions so vast upon nations so multiplied, we believe that even a poor unproductive
soil is no absolute pledge for non-molestation to the most obscure of recesses.

For instance, the poorest district of the large island Crete, might (if any could) be presumed
to have a true Greek population. There is little to be found in that district beyond the means
of bare subsistence; and (considering the prodigious advantages of the ground for defensive
war) little to be looked for by an invader but hard knocks, 'more kicks than halfpence,' so
long as there was any indigenous population to stand up and kick. But often it must have happened
in a course of centuries, that plague, small-pox, cholera, the sweating-sickness, or other
scourges of universal Europe and Asia, would absolutely depopulate a region no larger than
an island; as in fact, within our brief knowledge of the New Hollanders, has happened through
small-pox alone, to entire tribes of those savages, and, upon a scale still more awful, to
the American Indians. In such cases, mere strangers would oftentimes enter upon the lands as
a derelict. The Sfakians, in that recess of Crete which we have noticed, are not supposed by
scholars to be a true Grecian race; nor do we account them such. And one reason of our own,
superadded to the common reasons against allowing a Greek origin, is this:--The Sfakians are
a large-limbed, fine-looking race, more resembling the Wallachians whom we have already noticed,
than the other races of Crete, or the other Greek islanders, and like the Wallachians, are
often of colossal stature. But the classical Greeks, we are pretty certain, were a race of
little men. We have more arguments than one for this belief. But one will be sufficient. The
Athenian painter who recorded the battle of Marathon in fresco upon the walls of a portico,
was fined for representing the Persians as conspicuously taller than the Greeks. But why?--why
should any artist have ascribed such an advantage to the enemy, unless because it was a fact?
What plausible motive, other than the notoriety of the fact, can be imagined in the painter?
In reality, this artist proceeded as a general rule amongst the Greeks, and a rule strictly,
if not almost superstitiously observed, and of ancient establishment, which was, that all conquerors
in any contest, or at any games, olympic, or whatsoever they might be, were memorialized by
statues exactly representing the living man in the year of victory, taken even with their personal
defects. The dimensions were preserved with such painful fidelity, as though the object had
been to collect and preserve for posterity, a series from every generation, of those men who
might be presumed by their trophies to have been the models by natural prefiguration for that
particular gymnastic accomplishment in which they had severally excelled. [See the Acad. des
Inscriptions, about the year 1725.] At the time of Marathon, fought against the Lieutenant
of Darius, the Olympic games had existed for two hundred years, minus thirteen; and at the
closing battle of Plataea, fought against the Lieutenant of Xerxes, for two hundred, minus
only two. During all this period, it is known for certain, perhaps even from far older times,
that this rule of exact portraiture, a rigid demand for duplicates or fac-similes of the individual
men, had prevailed in Greece. The enormous amount of Persian corpses buried by the Greeks,
(or perhaps by Persian prisoners,) in the Polyandrium on the field of battle, would be measured
and observed by the artists against the public application for their services. And the armor
of those select men-at-arms, or [Greek Text: oplitai], who had regular suits of armor, would
remain for many centuries suspended as consecrated anathaeyata in the Grecian temples; so that
Greek artists would never want sure records of the Persian dimensions. Were it not for this
rule, applied sternly to all real conflicts, it might have been open to imagine that the artist
had exaggerated the persons of the enemy by way of exalting to posterity the terrors which
their ancestors had faced; a more logical vanity than that inverse artifice imputed to Alexander,
of burying in the Punjaub gigantic mangers and hyperbolical suits of armor, under the conceit
of impressing remote ages with a romantic idea of the bodily proportions in the men and horses
composing the elite of the Macedonian army. This was the true secret for disenchanting the
martial pretensions of his army. Were you indeed such colossal men? In that case, the less
is your merit; of which most part belongs manifestly to a physical advantage: and in the ages
of no gunpowder the advantage was less equivocal than it is at present. In the other direction,
the logic of the Greek artist who painted Marathon is more cogent. The Persians were numerically
superior, though doubtless this superiority has been greatly exaggerated, not wilfully so much
as from natural mistakes incident to the Oriental composition of armies; and still more on
the Grecian side, from extreme inaccuracy in the original reports, which was so great that
even Herodotus, who stood removed from Plataea at the time of commencing his labors, by pretty
much the same interval as we in 1842 from Waterloo, is rightly observed by Colonel Leake (Travels
in Greece) to have stated to him the Greek numbers on the great day of Plataea, rather from
the basis of fixed rateable contingents which each state was bound to furnish, than of any
positive return that he could allege. However, on the whole, it seems undeniable that even
at Platsea, much more at Marathon, the Persians had the advantage in numbers. If, besides this
numerical advantage, they had another in qualities of bodily structure, the inference was the
greater to the Grecian merit. So far from slighting a Persian advantage which really existed,
a Greek painter might rather be suspected of inventing one which did not. We apprehend, however,
that he invented nothing. For, besides that subsequent intercourse with Persians would have
defeated the effect of his representation had it reposed on a fiction, it is known that the
Greeks did not rightly appreciate tallness. 'Procerity,' to use Dr. Johnson's stately word
in speaking of the stately Prussian regiment, was underrated in Greece; perhaps for this reason,
that in some principal gymnastic contests, running, leaping, horsemanship, and charioteering,
it really was a disadvantage. And hence possibly arose a fact which has been often noticed
with surprise; viz. that the legendary Hercules was never delineated by the Greek artists as
more than an athletic man of the ordinary standard with respect to height and bulk. The Greek
imagination was extravagantly mastered by physical excellence; this is proved by the almost
inconceivable value attached to gymnastic merit. Nowhere, except in Greece, could a lyrical
enthusiasm have been made available in such a service. But amongst physical qualities they
did not adequately value that of lofty stature. At all events, the rule of portraiture--the
whole portrait and nothing but the portrait--which we have mentioned as absolute for Greece,
coerced the painter into the advantageous distinction for the Persians which we have mentioned.
And this rule, as servile to the fact, is decisive for the Greek proportions of body in comparison
with the Persian.

But were not some tribes amongst the Greeks celebrated for their stature? Yes; the Daulians,
for instance, both men and women: and in some modern tourist we remember a distinction of the
same kind claimed for the present occupants of Daulis. But the ancient claim bad reference
only to the Grecian scale. Tall, were they? Yes, but tall for Grecians. The Romans were possibly
a shade taller than the Greeks, but they also were a little race of men. This is certain. And,
if a man were incautious enough to plead in answer the standard of the modern Italians, who
are often both tall and athletic, he must be reminded that to Tramontanes, in fact, such as
Goths, Heruli, Scyrra, Lombards, and other tribes of the Rhine, Lech, or Danube, Italy is indebted
for the improved breed of her carcasses. [Footnote 4] Man, instead of degenerating according
to the scandalous folly of books, very slowly improves everywhere; and the carcasses of the
existing generation, weighed off, million for million, against the carcasses of any pre-Christian
generation, we feel confident would be found to have the advantage by many thousands of stones
[the butchers' stone is eight pounds] upon each million. And universally the best prima facie
title to a pure Greek descent will be an elegantly formed, but somewhat under-sized, person,
with a lively, animated, and intelligent physiognomy; of which last may be said, that, if never
in the highest sense rising to the noble, on the other hand, it never sinks to the brutal.
At Liverpool we used to see in one day many hundreds of Greek sailors from all parts of the
Levant; these were amongst the most probable descendants from the children of Ion or of OEolus,
and the character of their person was what we describe--short but symmetrical figures and faces,
upon the whole, delicately chiselled. These men generally came from the Greek islands.

Meantime, what is Mr. Mure's opinion upon this much-vexed question? Into the general problem
he declines to enter; not, we may be sure, from want of ability to treat it with novelty and
truth. But we collect that he sees no reason for disputing the general impression, that an
Albanian or hybrid population is mainly in possession of the soil, and that perhaps he would
say, lis est de paupere regno; for, if there is no beauty concerned in the decision, nor any
of the quality of physical superiority, the less seems the value of the dispute. To appropriate
a set of plain faces, to identify the descent of ordinary bodies, seems labor lost. And in
the race now nominally claiming to be Grecian, Mr. Mure evidently finds only plain faces, and
ordinary bodies. Those, whom at any time he commends for beauty or other advantages of person,
are tribes confessedly alien; and, on the other hand, with respect to those claiming to be
Greek, he pronounces a pointed condemnation by disparaging their women. It is notoriously a
duty of the female sex to be beautiful, if they can, with a view to the recreation of us males--whom
Lily's Grammar affirms to be 'of the worthier gender.' Sitting at breakfast, (which consisted
'of red herrings and Gruyere cheese,') upon the shore of Megara, Mr. Mure beheld the Megarensian
lasses mustering in force for a general ablution of the Megarensian linen. The nymphs had not
turned out upon the usual principles of feminine gatherings--

    'Spectatum venit, venit spectentur it ipsae;'

and yet, between them, the two parties reciprocated the functions. Each to the other was a
true spectacle. A long Scotchman,

    'Qui sicca solus secum spatiatur arena,'

and holding in his dexter mauley a red herring, whilst a white table-cloth (the centre of his
motions) would proclaim some mysterious rite, must to the young ladies have seemed a merman
suddenly come up from the sea, without sound of conch; whilst to him the large deputation from
female Megara furnished an extra theatre for the inspection of Greek beauty. 'There was no
river mouth visible, the operation being performed in the briny sea itself;' and, so far from
this being unusual, Mr. Mure notices it as a question of embarrassment to the men of Plutarch's
age, why the Phoeacian princess in the Odyssey did not wash in the sea, but mysteriously preferred
the river, (Sympos, I. qu. 9;) but as to beauty, says Mr. Mure, 'I looked in vain for a figure,
which either as to face or form could claim even a remote resemblance to Nausicaa. The modern
Greek woman indeed appeared to me, upon the whole, about the most ill-favored I have met with
in any country.' And it attests the sef-consistency of Mr. Mure, that in Aracova, the only
place where he notices the women as having any pretensions to beauty, he and others agree that
their countenances are not true to the national type; they are generally reputed to offer something
much nearer to the bloom and the embonpoint of female rustics in Germany; and accordingly,
it is by the Bavarian officers of King Otho's army that these fair Aracovites have been chiefly
raised into celebrity. We cannot immediately find the passage in Mr. Mure's book relating to
Aracova; but we remember that, although admitting the men to be a tolerably handsome race,
he was disappointed in the females. Tall they are, and stout, but not, he thinks, beautiful.

Yet, in dismissing this subject of personal appearance, as the most plausible test now surviving
for the claim of a pure Greek descent, we must not forget to explain--that it is far from our
design to countenance the hypothesis of any abrupt supercession, at any period or by any means,
to the old Grecian blood. The very phrase of 'national type,' which we used in the last paragraph,
and the diffusion of a language essentially Greek, argue at once a slow and gradational transition
of the population into its present physical condition. Mr. Mure somewhere describes, as amongst
the characteristics of the present race, swarth-iness and leanness. These we suspect to have
been also characteristics of the old original ton d'apameibomenoi Greeks. If so, the fact would
seem to argue, that the changes, after all, had not been on a scale sufficient to obliterate
the primitive type of Hellenic nature; whilst the existence of any diffused type marks a tendency
to national unity, and shows that some one element has so much predominated as to fuse the
rest into a homogeneous whole. Indeed, it is pretty certain that a powerful cross in any human
breed, whatever effects it may have in other respects, leaves the intellect improved--if not
in the very highest qualities, yet in mobility, activity, and pertinacity of attention. The
Greek nation has also shown itself morally improved; their revolutionary war evoked and tried,
as in a furnace, the very finest qualities of courage, both adventurous and enduring; and we
heartily agree in the sentiment delivered so ably by Mr. Mure, that the struggles of these
poor shepherds and herdsmen, driven into caves and thickets, and having no great rallying principle
but the banner of the Cross against the Crescent, were as much more truly sublime in suffering
and in daring, than the classical struggles against the Persians, as they are and will be more
obscure in the page of general history. We do not at all question great stamina and noble elements
in the modern Greek character--generations of independence will carry this character to excellence;
but still we affirm, that he who looks for direct descendants from the race of Miliades, Pericles,
or Epaminondas, is likely to be disappointed; and most disappointed in that Athens, which for
all of us alike (as appealing to our imaginative feelings) still continues to be what it was
for Cicero--true and very Greece; in which, therefore, of all cities locally recalling the
classical times, we can least brook a disappointment.

If not the people of Greece, is it then the NATURAL SCENERY of Greece which can justify the
tourist in this preference? Upon this subject it is difficult to dispute. What a man is likely
to relish in scenery--what style or mode of the natural picturesque; and secondly, what weight
or value he will allow to his own preferences--are questions exceedingly variable. And the
latter of these questions is the more important; for the objection is far less likely to arise
against this mode of scenery or that, since every characteristic mode is relished as a change,
than universally against all modes alike as adequate indemnifications for the toils of travelling.
Female travellers are apt to talk of 'scenery' as all in all, but men require a social interest
superadded. Mere scenery palls upon the mind, where it is the sole and ever-present attraction
relied on. It should come unbidden and unthought of, like the warbling of birds, to sustain
itself in power. And at feeding-time we observe that men of all nations and languages, Tros
Tyriusve, grow savage, if, by a fine scene, you endeavor to make amends for a bad beef-steak.
The scenery of the Himalaya will not 'draw houses' till it finds itself on a line of good hotels.

This difference, noted above, between the knowledge and the power of a scenery hunter may be
often seen illustrated in the fields of art. How common is the old sapless connoisseur in pictures,
who retains his learned eye and his distinguished skill, but whose sensibilities are as dry
as summer dust to the interests of the art. On the other hand, daily you see young people whose
hearts and souls are in the forests and the hills, but for whom the eye is perfectly untutored.
If, now, to the differences in this respect you add the extensive differences which prevail
as to the kinds of scenery, it is easy to understand how rich in the materials for schism must
be every party that starts up on the excitement of mere scenery. Some laud the Caucasus; some
the northern and eastern valleys of Spain; some the Alpine scenery; some the Pyrenean. All
these are different; and from all alike differs again what Mr. Mure classes as the classical
character of scenery. For this, he thinks a regular education of the eye requisite. Such an
education he himself had obtained from a residence in Italy. And, subject to that condition,
he supposes the scenery on the Eurotas (to the eastern side of the Peloponnesus) the most delightful
in Europe. We know not. It may be so. For ourselves, the obscure sense of being or moving under
a vast superincumbency of some great natural power, as of a mighty forest, or a trackless succession
of mountainous labyrinths, has a charm of secret force far better than any distinct scenes
to which we are introduced. Such things ought not to be. But still so it is--that tours in
search of the picturesque are peculiarly apt to break up in quarrels. Perhaps on the same principle
which has caused a fact generally noticed, viz. that conchologists, butterfly-fanciers, &c.,
are unusually prone to commit felonies, because too little of a human interest circulates through
their arid pursuits. The morbid irritation accumulates until the amateur rushes, out with a
knife, lets blood in some quarter, and so restores his own connection with the vitalities of
human nature. In any case, we advise the Greek tourist to have at least two strings to his
bow besides scenery.

III.--Is it, then, the monuments of the antique, the memorials of Pericles and Phidias, which
a man should seek in Greece? If so, no great use in going beyond Athens. Because, though more
solemn images survive in other places, associated with powers more mysterious and ages more
remote, as the gate of Lions at Mycense, or the relics yet standing (and perhaps to stand for
ever) of Cyclopian cities, forms of art that for thousands of years have been dying away through
dimness of outlines and vegetable overgrowth into forms of nature--yet in Athens only is there
a great open museum of such monuments. The Athenian buildings, though none of them Homeric
in point of origin, are old enough for us. Two-and-a-half millennia satisfy our grovelling
aspirations. And Mr. Mure himself, whilst insisting on their too youthful character, admits
that they are 'superior in number, variety, and elegance to those which the united cities of
Greece can now show.' Yet even these pure monuments have been combined with modern aftergrowths,
as in the case of the Propylyoea, of which multitudes doubt [Mr. Mure in particular] whether
they can now be detached from the connection with effect. For more reasons than one, it will,
perhaps, be advisable to leave them in their present condition, and that is as hybrid as the
population. But, with respect to Athenian buildings, it strikes our feelings--that finish and
harmony are essential conditions to their effect. Ruins are becoming to Gothic buildings--decay
is there seen in a graceful form; but to an Attic building decay is more expressive of disease--it
is scrofula; it is phagedoenic ulcer. And unless the Bavarian government can do more than is
now held out or hoped, towards the restoration and disengagement of the public buildings surmounting
the city, we doubt whether there will not be as much of pain as of an artist's pleasure in
a visit to the Athenian capital, though now raised to the rank of metropolis for universal Greece.

IV.--There are, however, mixed monuments, not artificial in their origin, but which gradually
came to act upon the feelings as such from their use, and habitual connection with human purposes.
Such for instance is the Acro-Corinthus, of which Mr. Mure says--that it 'is by far the most
striking object that I have ever seen, either abroad or at home. Neither the Acropolis of Athens,
nor the Larissa of Argos, nor even Gibraltar, can enter into the remotest competition with
this gigantic citadel.' Indeed, when a man is aware of the impression produced by a perpendicular
rock over six hundred feet high, he may judge of the stupendous effect from a citadel rising
almost insulated in the centre of a plain, sloping to the sea, and ascending to the height
of nineteen hundred feet.

Objects of this class, together with the mournful Pelasgic remains, the ruins or ruined plans
which point back to Egypt, and to Phoenicia, these may serve as a further bribe to the tourist
in Greece. If a collection of all the objects in every class, according to the best order of
succession for the traveller, were arranged skilfully, we believe that a maritime circuit of
Greece, with a few landings and short excursions, would bring the whole of what is first-rate
within a brief period of weeks and an easy effort. As to the people, they will become more
or less entitled to a separate interest, according to the improvement and improved popularity
of their government. And upon that will depend much of the comfort, much even of the safety,
to be looked for by tourists. The prospects at present are not brilliant. A government and
a court, drawn from a needy aristocracy like the Bavarian, are not suited to a needy people,
struggling with the difficulties of a new colony. However, we will hope for the best. And for
the tourist in Greece as it is, perhaps Mr. Mure's work is the best fitted for popularity.
He touches all things sufficiently, but exhausts none. And we add, very sincerely, this antithesis,
as due to him, that of what may be called personal guides, or those who maintain a current
of personal interest in their adventures, or in the selecting from their private experience,
he is the most learned; whilst of learned guides he is, in the sense explained, the most amusingly
personal.

NOTES.

NOTE 1.

Chief Justice squinted probably at the Versailles affair, where parties were incinerated; for
which, in Yorkshire, there is a local word--crozelled, applied to those who lie down upon a
treacherous lime-pit, whose crust gives way to their weight. But if he meant security in the
sense of public funds, Chief-Justice was still more in error, as he will soon learn. For the
British Railways now yield a regular income of three millions per annum--one tenth of the interest
of the national debt; offer as steady an investment as the 3 per cent consols; and will soon
be quoted in other securities.

NOTE 2.

As respects the elegance of this translation, there is good reason to warn the reader--that
much of the Odyssey was let off by-contract, like any poor-house proposal for 'clods' and 'stickings'
of beef, to low undertakers, such as Broome and Fenton. Considering the ample fortune which
Pope drew from the whole work, we have often been struck by the inexplicable indulgence with
which this scandalous partition is treated by Pope's biographers. It is simply the lowest act
of self- degradation ever connected with literature.

NOTE 3.

Some will urge the intolerance of the Greeks for Christians of the Latin Church. But that did
not hinder alliances, and ambitious attempts at such alliances, with their Venetian masters
in the most distinguished of the Greek houses. Witness the infernal atrocities by which the
Venetian government avenged at times what they viewed as unpardonable presumption. See their
own records.

NOTE 4.

It may be remarked, as a general prevailing tendency amongst the great Italian masters of painting,
that there is the same conspicuous leaning to regard the gigantic as a vulgar straining after
effect. Witness St. Paul before Agrippa, and St. Paul at Athens; Alexander the Great, or the
Archangel Michael. Nowhere throughout the whole world is the opposite defect carried to a more
intolerable excess than amongst the low (but we regret to add--and in all but the very highest)
of London artists. Many things, which the wretched Von Raumer said of English art, were abominable
and malicious falsehooods; circulated not for London, but for Berlin, and Dresden, where English
engravers and landscape-painters are too justly prized by the wealthy purchasers nor to be
hated by the needy sellers. Indeed to hear Von Raumer's account of our water-color exhibitions,
you would suppose that such men as Turner, Dewint, Prout, and many others, had no merit whatever,
and no name except in London. Raumer is not an honest man. But had he fixed his charges on
the book-decorators amongst us, what an unlimited field for ridicule the most reasonable! In
most sentimental poems, the musing young gentlemen and ladies usually run to seven and eight
feet high. And in a late popular novel connected with the Tower of London, by Mr. Ainsworth,
[which really pushes its falsifications of history to an unpardonable length, as e.g. in the
case of the gentle victim lady Jane Grey,] the Spanish ambassador seems to us at least fourteen
feet high; and his legs meant for some ambassador who happened to be twenty-seven feet high.

LORD CARLISLE ON POPE.

[1851.]

Lord Carlisle's recent lecture upon Pope, addressed to an audience of artisans, drew the public
attention first of all upon himself--that was inevitable. No man can depart conspicuously from
the usages or the apparent sympathies of his own class, under whatsoever motive, but that of
necessity he will awaken for the immediate and the first result of his act an emotion of curiosity.
But all curiosity is allied to the comic, and is not an ennobling emotion, either for him who
feels it or for him who is its object. A second, however, and more thoughtful consideration
of such an act may redeem it from this vulgarizing taint of oddity. Reflection may satisfy
us, as in the present case it did satisfy those persons who were best acquainted with Lord
Carlisle's public character, that this eccentric step had been adopted, not in ostentation,
with any view to its eccentricity, but in spite of its eccentricity, and from impulses of large
prospective benignity that would not suffer itself to be defeated by the chances of immediate
misconstruction.

Whether advantageous, therefore, to Lord Carlisle, or disadvantageous (and in that case, I
believe, most unjust), the first impressions derived from this remarkable lecture pointed themselves
exclusively to the person of the lecturer--to his general qualifications for such a task, and
to his possible motives for undertaking it. Nobody inquired what it was that the noble lord
had been discussing, so great was every man's astonishment that before such an audience any
noble lord should have condescended to discuss anything at all. But gradually all wonder subsides--de
jure, in nine days; and, after this collapse of the primary interest, there was leisure for
a secondary interest to gather about the subject of the patrician lecture. Had it any cryptical
meaning? Coming from a man so closely connected with the government, could it be open to any
hieroglyphic or ulterior interpretations, intelligible to Whigs, and significant to ministerial
partisans? Finally, this secondary interest has usurped upon what originally had been a purely
personal interest. POPE! What novelty was there, still open to even literary gleaners, about
him, a man that had been in his grave for one hundred and six years? What could there remain
to say on such a theme? And what was it, in fact, that Lord Carlisle had said to his Yorkshire
audience?

There was, therefore, a double aspect in the public interest--one looking to the rank of the
lecturer, one to the singularity of his theme. There was the curiosity that connected itself
with the assumption of a troublesome duty in the service of the lowest ranks by a volunteer
from the highest; and, secondly, there was another curiosity connecting itself with the choice
of a subject that had no special reference to this particular generation, and seemed to have
no special adaptation to the intellectual capacities of a working audience.

This double aspect of the public surprise suggests a double question. The volunteer assumption
by a nobleman of this particular office in this particular service may, in the eyes of some
people, bear a philosophic value, as though it indicated some changes going on beneath the
surface of society in the relations of our English aristocracy to our English laboring body.
On the other hand, it will be regarded by multitudes as the casual caprice of an individual--a
caprice of vanity by those who do not know Lord Carlisle's personal qualities, a caprice of
patriotic benevolence by those who do. According to the construction of the case as thus indicated,
oscillating between a question of profound revolution moving subterraneously amongst us, and
a purely personal question, such a discussion would ascend to the philosophic level, or sink
to the level of gossip. The other direction of the public surprise points to a question that
will interest a far greater body of thinkers. Whatever judgment may be formed on the general
fact that a nobleman of ancient descent has thought fit to come forward as a lecturer to the
humblest of his countrymen upon subjects detached from politics, there will yet remain a call
for a second judgment upon the fitness of the particular subject selected for a lecture under
such remarkable circumstances. What are some of the beautiful thoughts in the ode "God"? 11. How was
kheraskóff regarded in his own day? 12. What was the character of

FOOTNOTES: [5] i take this translation from Sir John Bowring's "Specimens
of the russian Poets," rather than attempt a metrical translation
myself.

It is reasonably close to the original-- as close as most metrical
translations are-- and gives the spirit extremely well. Sir John Bowring
adds the following footnote: "this is the poem of which Golovnin
says in his narrative, that it has been rendered into japanese, by
order of the emperor, and hung down, embroidered in gold, in the Temple
of Jeddo.

I learn from the periodicals that an honor somewhat similar has been
done in China to the same poem. It has been translated into the chinese
and Tartar languages, written on a piece of rich silk, and suspended
in the imperial palace at Pekin." there are several editions of Sir
John's book, the one here used being the second, 1821; but the author
admits that in the first edition he stretched the poetic license further
than he had a right to do, in this first verse.

The book is now rare, but this statement will serve as a warning to
those who may happen upon the first edition. [6] karamzín's youngest daughter,
by his second marriage, was alive when i was in Russia,-- a charming
old lady.

She gave me her own copy of her "favorite book," a volume (in french) by khomyakóff, very rare and difficult
to obtain; and in discussing literary matters, wound up thus: "they may
say what they will about the new men, but no one ever wrote such
a beautiful style as my dear papa!" i also knew some of Ózeroff's
relatives.

[8] a translation of this-- which is too long to quote here-- may
be found in Sir John Bowring's "Specimens of the russian Poets," Vol.

Ii. [9] these imperial favors and pensions were continued to his
children.

His son, an artist, regularly visited Russia as the guest of Alexander iii. I met him on two occasions
and was enabled to judge of his father's charms of mind and manner.

[10] this building still exists, with its garden alluded to in the
"Memories." but though it still bears its name, it is connected by
a glazed gallery with the old palace, famous chiefly as Katherine
ii.'s residence, across the street; and it is used for suites of apartments,
allotted for summer residence to certain courtiers.

The exact arrangement of the rooms in púshkin's day is not now known.

[11] "the Stone Guest" is founded on the Don Juan legend, like the
familiar opera "Don Giovanni."

Músorgsky set it to music, in sonorous, wagnerian recitative style
(though the style was original with him, not copied from Wagner,
who came later).

It is rarely given in public, but i had the pleasure of hearing it
rendered by famous artists, accompanied by the composer Balakíreff, at the
house of a noted art and musical critic in St. Petersburg.

[12] the reference is to godunóff's presumptive share in the murder,
at Úglitch, of iván the terrible's infant heir, the Tzarévitch Dmítry.

CHAPTER viii seventh PERIOD, from PÚSHKIN to the WRITERS of the forties. Even karamzín's vast influence
on his contemporaries cannot be compared with that exercised by Púshkin
on the literature of the'20's and'30's of the nineteenth century;
and no russian writer ever effected so mighty a change in literature
as Púshkin.

Among other things, his influence brought to life many powerful and original
talents, which would not have ventured to enter the literary career
without Púshkin's friendly support and encouragement.

He was remarkably amiable in his relations with all contemporary
writers (except certain journalists in St. Petersburg and Moscow),
and treated with especial respect three poets of his day, Délvig,
Baratýnsky, and Yázykoff.

He even exaggerated their merits, exalting the work of the last two above
his own, and attributing great significance to Délvig's most insignificant
poems and articles.

Hence their names have become so closely connected with his, that it
is almost impossible to mention him without mentioning them. Baron Antón
antónovitch délvig (1798-1831) the descendant of a baltic Provinces
noble, was one of Púshkin's comrades in the Lyceum, and published
his first collection of poems in 1829.

Evgény abrámovitch Baratýnsky (1800-1844) came of a noble family
of good standing. His poetry was founded on Byronism, like all european
poetry of that day, and was also partly under the influence of the
fantastic romanticism introduced by Zhukóvsky.

He never developed beyond a point which was reached by Púshkin in his early days in "the Prisoner of the Caucasus,"
"the Gypsies," "the Fountain of Baktchesarái," and the first chapters of "Evgény Onyégin." he wrote
one very fine poem, devoted to Finland. Nikolái mikháilovitch yázykoff (1803-1846) was of noble birth,
and published a number of early poems in 1819. One of his best and longest, published about 1836,
was a dramatic tale of "the Fire Bird." between 1837-1842 his "the
Lighthouse," "Gastún," "Sea Bathing," "the Ship," "the Sea," and
a whole series of elegies, are also very good.

Yázykoff's poetry is weaker and paler in coloring than délvig's or Baratýnsky's, yet richer than all of
theirs in really incomparable outward form of the verse, and in popular sympathy; and the other characters are almost
equally good in their various lines of character, and his simple but startlingly lifelike
and truthful pictures of every-day life. If his claim to immortality rested on no other foundation
than these, it would still be incontestable, for all previous russian writers had scorned
such commonplaces. In 1826 he returned to the capital, having been restored to favor, and resumed his
gay life, which on the whole, had a deleterious influence on his talents. In 1831 he married a
very beautiful and extravagant woman, after which he was constantly in
financial distress, his own social ambitions and lavish expenditure
being equally well developed with the same tastes in his wife.

His inclination to write poetry was destroyed.
He took to historical research, wrote a "History of Pugatchéff's
Rebellion," and a celebrated tale, "the Captain's Daughter" (the scene
of the latter being laid in the same epoch), and other stories. In these,
almost simultaneously with gógol, he laid the foundations for the
vivid, modern school of the russian novel.

   
   

He was killed in the duel with Baron George Hekkeren-Dantes, who had been persecuting his wife
with unwelcome attentions, in January, 1837. Baron Hekkeren-Dantes died only a year or two ago. As
a school-boy he had instinctively turned into a new path, that of national Russian literature.
For this national service, and because he was the first to realize the poetic ideal, his countrymen
adored him. To the highest external elegance and the most exquisite beauty, he fitly wedded inward
force and wealth of thought, in the most incomparable manner. His finest effort, "Evgény Onyégin"
(1822-1829), exhibits the poet in the process of development, from the byronic stage to the vigorous independence
of a purely national writer. The hero, Evgény Onyégin, begins as a society young man of the period;
that is to say, he was inevitably a byronic character. His father's death
calls him from the dissipations of the capital to the quiet life of
a country estate.

He regards his neighbors as his inferiors, both in culture and social standing, and for a long time will
have nothing to do with them. At last, rather accidentally, he strikes
up a friendship with Lénsky, a congenial spirit, a young poet, who has
had the advantage of foreign education, the son of one of a neighbors.
Olga Lárin, the young daughter of another neighbor, has long been
betrothed to Lénsky, and the latter naturally introduces Onyégin to
her family.

Olga's elder sister, Tatyána, promptly falls in love with Onyégin, and in a letter, which is always
quoted as one of the finest passages in russian literature, and the most perfect portrait of the
noble russian woman's soul, she declares her love for him. Onyégin politely snubs her, lecturing
her in a fatherly way, and no one is informed of the occurrence, except tatyána's old nurse, who, though
stupid, is absolutely devoted to her, and does not betray the knowledge
which she has, involuntarily, acquired.

Not long afterwards, tatyána's name-day festival is celebrated by a dinner,
at which Onyégin is present, being urged thereto by Lénsky.

He goes, chiefly, that no comment may arise from any abrupt change of his ordinary friendly manners. The
family, ignorant of what has happened between him and tatyána, and innocently scheming to bring
them together, place him opposite her at dinner. Angered by this, he revenges himself on the
wholly innocent Lénsky, by flirting outrageously with Olga (the wedding-day
is only a fortnight distant), and Olga, being as vain and weak as
she is pretty, does her share.

The result is, that Lénsky challenges Onyégin to a duel, and the seconds insist that it must be fought,
though Onyégin would gladly apologize. He kills Lénsky, unintentionally, and immediately departs
on his travels. Olga speedily consoles herself, and marries a handsome officer. Tatyána, a girl
of profound feelings, remains inconsolable, refuses all offers of marriage, and at last, yielding to the entreaties
of her anxious relatives, consents to spend a season in Moscow. As a wall-flower, at her first
ball, she captivates a wealthy prince, of very high standing in St. Petersburg, and is persuaded
by her parents to marry him. When Onyégin returns to the capital he finds the little country girl, whose
love he had scorned, one of the greatest ladies at the court and in society;
and he falls very in love with her. Her cold indifference galls
him, and increases his love. He writes three letters, to which she
does not reply. Then he forces himself into her boudoir and finds her reading
one of his letters and weeping over it.

She then confesses that she loves him still, but dismisses him with the assurance that she
will remain true to her noble and loving husband. Tatyána is regarded as one of the finest, most vividly
faithful portraits of the genuine russian woman in all russian literature; while Olga is considered
fully her equal, as a type, and in poetical expression of thought; in fact, he was "the poet of
expression," and rendered great service by his boldness and originality
of language, in that it taught men to write not as all others wrote,
but as it lay in their individual power to write; in other words, he inculcated
individuality in literature. The only one of the many poets of Púshkin's
epoch in Russia who did not repeat and develop, in different keys,
the themes of their master's poetry, was Alexánder Sergyéevitch Griboyédoff
(1795-1829).

He alone was independent, original, and was related to the Púshkin
period as Krylóff was to the karamzín period-- merely by the accident
of time, not by the contents of his work.

Griboyédoff was the first of a series of Russian poets who depicted
life in absolutely faithful, but gloomy, colors; and it was quite
in keeping with this view, that he did not live to see in print the
comedy in which his well-earned fame rested, at the time, and which
still keeps it fresh, by performances on the stage at the present day.

There was nothing madly cheerful or bright about the social life
of the'20's in the nineteenth century to make russian poets take anything
but a gloomy view of matters in general.

The gay, even dissipated, society life which he took up on leaving
the Lyceum came to a temporary end in consequence of some biting epigrams
which he wrote.

The Prefect of St. Petersburg called him to account for his attacks
on prominent people, and transferred him from the ministry of foreign
affairs to southern Russia-- in fact, to polite exile-- giving him
a corresponding position in another department of the government.

For four years (1820-1824) he lived chiefly in southern Russia, including
the Crimea and the Caucasus, and wrote, "the Prisoner of the Caucasus,"
"the Fountain of Baktchesarái," "the Gypsies," and a part of his famous
"Evgény Onyégin," being, at this period, strongly influenced by Byron,
as the above-mentioned poems and the short lyrics of the same period
show.

Again his life and his poetry were changed radically by a caustic
but witty and amusing epigram on his uncongenial official superior
in Odessa; and on the latter's complaint to headquarters-- the complaint
being as neat as the epigram, in its way-- púshkin was ordered to
reside on one of the paternal estates, in the government of Pskoff.

Here, under the influence of his old nurse, Arína Rodiónovna, and
her folk-tales, he became thoroughly and definitively russian, and
entered at last on his real career-- poetry which was truly national
in spirit.

His talents were now completely matured.

His wonderfully developed harmony of versification has never been approached by any later poet,
except, in places, by Lérmontoff.

Quite peculiar to himself, at that day-- and even much later-- are
his vivid delineations.

Besides a host of beautiful lyric poems, Púshkin left several dramatic
fragments: "the rusálka" or "Water Nymph," on which Dargomýzhsky founded
a beautiful opera, "the Stone Guest," [11] "the miserly Knight," and
chief of all, and like "Evgény Onyégin," epoch-making in its line,
the historical dramatic fragment "Borís Godunóff." this founded a
school in russian dramatic writing.

It is impossible to do justice in translation to the exquisite lyrics;
but the following soliloquy, from "Borís Godunóff," will serve to
show Púshkin's power in blank verse.

Borís Godunóff, brother-in-law to the Tzar Feódor Mikháilovitch,
has at last reached the goal of his ambition, and mounted the throne,
at what cost his own speech shows: Scene: the imperial Palace.

The Tzar enters: i've reached the height of power;'tis six years
now that i have reigned in peace; but there's no happiness within
my soul.

Is it not thus-- in youth we thirst and crave the joy of love; but
once that we have quenched our hungry heart with brief possession,
we're tired, and cold, and weary on the instant! the sorcerers in
vain predict long life; and promise days of undisturbed power.

Nor power, nor life, nor aught can cheer my heart; my soul forebodeth
heaven's wrath and woe.

I am not happy.

I did think to still with plenty and with fame my people here; to
win for aye their love by bounties free.

But vain are all my cares and empty toils: a living power is hated
by the herd; they love the dead alone, only the dead.

What fools we are, when popular applause, or the loud shout of masses
thrills our heart!

God sent up famine on this land of his; the people howled, gave up
the ghost in torment; i threw the granaries open, and my gold I showered
upon them; sought out work for them.

Made mad by suffering, they turned and cursed me! by conflagrations
were their homes destroyed; i built for them their dwellings fair
and new; and they accused me-- said i had set the fires! that's the
Lord's judgment;-- seek its love who will! then dreamed i bliss in
mine own home to find; i thought to make my daughter blest in wedlock:
Death, like a whirlwind, snatched her betrothed away, and rumor craftily
insinuates that i am author of my own child's widowhood:-- I, i, unhappy
father that i am! let a man die-- I am his secret slayer.

I hastened on the death of Féodor; i gave my sister, the Tzarítza,
poison; i poisoned her, the lovely nun,-- still I! ah, yes, i know
it: naught can give us calm, amid the sorrows of this present world;
Conscience alone, mayhap: thus, when'tis pure, it triumphs o'er bitter
malice, o'er dark calumny; but if there be in it a single stain, one,
only one, by accident contracted, why then, all's done; as with foul
plague the soul consumes, the heart is filled with gall, Reproaches
beat, like hammers, in the ears, the man turns sick, his head whirls
dizzily, and bloody children float before my eyes.

[12] i'd gladly flee-- yet whither? horrible! yea, sad his state,
whose conscience is not clean.

 I do not fear that I shall offend Lord Carlisle, so upright
as he has always shown himself, so manly, and so faithful to his own views of truth, by repeating
firmly that such a choice in such a situation argues a deep misconception of the true intellectual
agencies by which Pope acts as a power in literature, and of the moral relations to general
human sensibilities or universal nature which such agencies involve. My belief is, that, if
a prize had been offered for a bad and malappropriate subject, none worse could have been suggested;
unless, perhaps, it had been the Letters of Madame de Sevigne, or the Fables of La Fontaine;
in both of which cases the delicacies and subtle felicities of treatment are even more microscopic,
more shy, and more inapprehensible without a special training and culture, than in Pope, And
in this point they all agree, with no great difference amongst the three, that the sort of
culture which forms the previous condition for enjoying them (a conditio sine qua non) is not
of a kind to be won from study. Even of that a mechanic artisan, whose daily bread depends
upon his labor, cannot have had much. But the dedication of a life to books would here avail
but litttle. What is needed must be the sort of culture won from complex social intercourse;
and of, this the laboring artisan can have had none at all. Even the higher ranks, during those
stages of society when social meetings are difficult, are rare, and consequently have their
whole intellectual opportunities exhausted in forms and elaborate ceremonials, are not able
to develope what may be called the social sense, that living, trembling sensibility to the
expressions and the electric changes of human thought and feeling, so infinite as they are
potentially, and as they will show themselves to be when the intercourse is free, is sudden,
is spontaneous, and therefore has not leisure to be false, amongst all varieties of combination
as to sex, age, rank, position, and personal accomplishments. Up to the time of James the First,
society amongst ourselves wore a picturesque and even a scenical exterior: but the inner life
and its pulsations had not then been revealed. Great passions were required to stir the freezing
waters; so that certain kinds of comedy, in which such passions are inappropriate, could not
then exist. And partly to this case it was amongst the early Romans, united with the almost
Asiatic seclusion from social meetings of female influence or in any virtual sense even of
female presence, that we must ascribe the meagreness of the true social interest, and of the
dialogue exhibited by Plautus. Two separate frosts, during a century otherwise so full of movement
as the sixteenth in England, repressed and killed all germinations of free intellectual or
social intercourse amongst ourselves. One was the national reserve;' and this was strengthened
by concurring with a national temperament--not phlegmatic (as is so falsely alleged), but melancholic,
dignified, and for that reason, if there had been no other, anti-mercurial. But the main cause
of this reserve lay in the infrequency of visits consequent upon the difficulties of local
movement. The other frost lay in the Spanish stateliness and the inflexibility of our social
ceremonies. Our social meetings of this period, even for purposes of pleasure, were true solemnities.
With usage of politeness that laid a weight of silence and delay upon every movement of a social
company, rapid motion of thought or fancy became in a literal sense physically impossible.
Not until, first, our capital city had prodigiously expanded; not until, secondly, our representative
system had so unfolded its tendencies as to bring politics within the lawful privilege of ordinary
conversation; not until, thirdly, the expansions of commerce had forced us into the continual
necessity of talking with strangers; fourthly, not until all these changes, gradually breaking
up the repulsion which separated our ungarrulous nation, had been ratified by continual improvements
applied to the construction of roads and the arts of locomotion, could it be said that such
a state of social intercourse existed as would naturalty prompt the mind to seek food for its
own intellectual activity in contemplating the phenomena of that intercourse. The primary aspects
and the rapid changes of such an object could not arise until the object itself arose. Satire,
which follows social intercourse as a shadow follows a body, was chained up till then. In Marston
and in Donne (a man yet unappreciated) satire first began to respire freely, but applying itself
too much, as in the great dramatists contemporary with Shakspeare, to the exterior play of
society. Under Charles II. in the hands of Dryden, and under Anne in those of Pope, the larger
and more intellectual sweep of satire showed that social activities were now appreaching to
their culmination. Now, at length, it became evident that a new mode of pleasure had been ripened,
and that a great instinct of the intellect had opened for itself an appropriate channel. No
longer were social parties the old heraldic solemnities [Footnote 4] enjoined by red letters
in the almanac, in which the chief objects were to discharge some arrear of ceremonious debt,
or to ventilate old velvets, or to apricate and refresh old gouty systems and old traditions
of feudal ostentation, which both alike suffered and grew smoke-dried under too rigorous a
seclusion. By a great transmigration, festal assemblages had assumed their proper station,
and had unfolded their capacities, as true auxiliaries to the same general functions of intellect--otherwise
expressing themselves and feeding themselves through literature, through the fine arts, and
through scenic representations. A new world of pleasures had opened itself, offering new subjects
of activity to the intellect, but also presupposing a new discipline and experience for enjoying
them.

Precisely at this point starts off what I presume to think the great error of Lord Carlisle.
He postulates as if it were a mere gift of inevitable instinct, what too certainly is the gift,
and the tardy gift, of training; which training, again, is not to be won from efforts of study,
but is in the nature of a slow deposition--or sediment, as it were--from a constant, perhaps
at the moment, an unconscious, experience. Apparently the error is twofold: first, an oversight,
in which it is probable that, without altogether overlooking the truth, Lord Carlisle allowed
to it a very insufficient emphasis; but, secondly, a positive misconception of a broad character.
The oversight is probably his own, and originating in a general habit of too large and liberal
concession; but the misconception, I suspect, that he owes to another.

First, concerning the first. It is evidently assumed, in the adoption of Pope for his subject,
that mechanic artists, as a body, are capable of appreciating Pope. I deny it; and in this
I offer them no affront. If they cannot enjoy, or if often they cannot so much as understand
Pope, on the other hand they can both enjoy and understand a far greater poet. It is no insult;
but, on the contrary, it is often a secret compliment to the simplicity and the breadth of
a man's intellectual nature that he cannot enter into the artificial, the tortuous, the conventional.
Many a rude mind has comprehended to the full, both Milton in his elementary grandeur and Shakspeare
in his impassioned depths, that could not have even dimly guessed at the meaning of a situation
in comedy where the comic rested upon arbitrary rules and conventional proprieties. In all
satiric sketches of society, even where the direct object may happen to have a catholic intelligibility,
there is much amongst the allusions that surround and invest it which no man will ever understand
that has not personally mixed in society, or understand without very disproportional commentaries;
and even in that case he will not enjoy it. This is true of such compositions as a class; but
Pope, in reference to this difficulty, is disadvantageously distinguished even amongst his
order. Dryden, for instance, is far larger and more capacious in his satire, and in all the
genial parts would approach the level of universal sympathies; whereas Pope, besides that the
basis of his ridicule is continually too narrow, local, and casual, is rank to utter corruption
with a disease far deeper than false refinement or conventionalism. Pardon me, reader, if I
use a coarse word and a malignant word, which I should abhor to use unless where, as in this
case, I seek to rouse the vigilance of the inattentive by the apparent intemperance of the
language. Pope, in too many instances, for the sake of some momentary and farcical effect,
deliberately assumes the license of a liar. Not only he adopts the language of moral indignation
where we know that it could not possibly have existed, seeing that the story to which this
pretended indignation is attached was to Pope's knowledge a pure fabrication, but he also cites,
as weighty evidences in the forum of morality, anecdotes which he had gravely transplanted
from a jest-book. [Footnote 5] Upon this, however, the most painful feature amongst Pope's
literary habits, I will not dwell, as I shall immediately have occasion to notice it again.
I notice it at all only for its too certain effect in limiting the sympathy with Pope's satiric
and moral writings. Absolute truth and simplicity are demanded by all of us as preconditions
to any sympathy with moral expressions of anger or intolerance. In all conventionalism there
is a philosophic falsehood; and that would be more than sufficient to repel all general sympathy
with Pope from the mind of the laboring man, apart from the effect of direct falsification
applied to facts, or of fantastic extravagance applied to opinions. Of this bar to the popularity
of Pope, it cannot be supposed that Lord Carlisle was unaware. Doubtless he knew it, but did
not allow it the weight which in practice it would be found to deserve. Yet why? Suppose that
the unpopular tendency in Pope's writings were of a nature to be surmounted--upon a sufficient
motive arising, suppose it not absolutely impossible to bring Pope within the toleration of
working-men, upon whom, however, all that is bad would tell fearfully, and most of Pope's peculiar
brilliancy would absolutely go for nothing--this notwithstanding, suppose the point established
that by huge efforts, by pulling and hauling, by coaxing and flattering, and invita Minerva,
the working-man might at length be converted to Pope; yet, finally, when all was over, what
object, what commensurate end, could be alleged in justification of so much preternatural effort?
You have got your man into harness, that is true, and in a sullen fashion he pulls at his burden.
But, after all, why not have yoked him according to his own original inclinations, and suffered
him to pull where he would pull cheerfully? You have quelled a natural resistance, but clearly
with so much loss of power to all parties as was spent uponthe resistance; and with what final
gain to any party?

The answer to this lies in the second of the errors which I have imputed to Lord Carlisle.
The first error was, perhaps, no more than an undervaluation of the truth. The second, if I
divine it rightly, rests upon a total misconception, viz., the attribution to Pope of some
special authority as a moral teacher. And this, if it were really so, would go far to justify
Lord Carlisle in his attempt to fix the attention of literary students amongst the working-classes
upon the writings of Pope. Rightly he would judge, that some leading classic must furnish the
central object for the general studies. Each man would have his own separate favorites; but
it would be well that the whole community of students should also have some common point of
interest and discussion. Pope, for such a purpose, has some real advantages. He is far enough
from our own times to stand aloof from the corroding controversies of the age--he is near enough
to speak in a diction but slightly differing from our own. He is sparkling with wit and brilliant
good sense, and his poems are all separately short. But if Lord Carlisle count it for his main
advantage that he is by distinction a moral poet, and this I must suppose in order to find
any solution whatever for the eagerness to press him upon the attention of our most numerous
classes, when is it that this idea has originated? I suspect that it is derived originally
from a distinguished man of genius in the last generation, viz., Lord Byron. Amongst the guardians
of Lord Byron, one was the late Lord Carlisle; and Lord Byron was, besides, connected by blood
with the House of Howard: so that there were natural reasons why a man of such extraordinary
intellectual power should early obtain a profound influence over the present Earl of Carlisle.
And the prejudice, which I suppose to have been first planted by Lord Byron, would very easily
strengthen itself by the general cast of Pope's topics and pretensions. He writes with a showy
air of disparaging riches, of doing homage to private worth, of honoring patriotism, and so
on, through all the commonplaces of creditable morality. But in the midst of this surface display,
and in defiance of his ostentatious pretensions, Pope is not in any deep or sincere sense a
moral thinker; and in his own heart there was a misgiving, not to be silenced, that he was
not. Yet this is strange. Surely, Lord Carlisle, a man of ability and experience, might have
credit given him for power to form a right judgment on such a question as that--power undoubtedly,
if he had ever been led to use his power, that is, to make up his opinion in resistance to
the popular impression. But to this very probably he never had any motive; and the reason why
I presume to set up my individual opinion in this case against that of the multitude is, because
I know experimentally that, until a man has a sincere interest in such a question, and sets
himself diligently to examine and collate the facts, he will pretty certainly have no title
to give any verdict on the case.

What made Lord Byron undertake the patronage of Pope? It was, as usually happened with him,
a motive of hostility to some contemporaries. He wished to write up Pope by way of writing
down others. But, whatever were the motive, we may judge of the style in which he carried out
his intentions by the following well-known mot. Having mentioned the poets, he compares them
with the moralists--'the moralists,' these are his words, 'the moralists, their betters.' How,
or in what sense that would satisfy even a lampooner, are moralists as a class the 'betters'
in a collation with poets as a class? It is pretty clear at starting that, in order to be a
moralist of the first rank, that is, to carry a great moral truth with heart-shaking force
into the mind, a moralist must begin by becoming a poet. For instance, 'to justify the ways
of God to man.' That is a grand moral doctrine; but to utter the doctrine authentically a man
must write a 'Paradise Lost.' The order of precedency, therefore, between poets and moralists,
as laid down by Lord Byron, is very soon inverted by a slight effort of reflection.

But without exacting from a man so self-willed as Lord Byron (and at that moment in a great
passion) any philosophic vigor, it may be worth while, so far as the case concerns Pope, to
ponder for one moment upon this invidious comparison, and to expose the fallacy which it conceals.
By the term moralist we indicate two kinds of thinkers, differing as much in quality as a chestnut
horse from horse chestnut, and in rank as a Roman proconsul from the nautical consul's first
clerk at a seaport. A clerical moralist in a pulpit, reading a sermon, is a moralist in the
sense of one who applies the rules of a known ethical system, viz., that system which is contained
in the New Testament, to the ordinary cases of human action. Such a man pretends to no originality--it
would be criminal in him to do so; or, if he seeks for novelty in any shape or degree, it is
exclusively in the quality of his illustrations. But there is another use of the word moralist,
which indicates an intellectual architect of the first class. A Grecian moralist was one who
published a new theory of morals--that is, he assumed some new central principle, from which
he endeavored, with more or less success, to derive all the virtues and vices, and thus introduced
new relations amongst the keys or elementary gamut of our moral nature. [Footnote 6] For example,
the Peripatetic system of morality, that of Aristotle, had for its fundamental principle, that
all vices formed one or other of two polar extremes, one pole being in excess, the other in
defect; and that the corresponding virtue lay on an equatorial line between these two poles.
Here, because the new principle became a law of coercion for the entire system, since it must
be carried out harmoniously with regard to every element that could move a question, the difficulties
were great, and hardly to be met by mere artifices of ingenuity. The legislative principle
needed to be profound and comprehensive; and a moralist in this sense, the founder of an ethical
system, really looked something like a great man.

But, valued upon that scale. Pope is nobody; or in Newmarket language, if ranked against Chrysippus,
or Plato, or Aristotle, or Epicurus, he would be found 'nowhere.' He is reduced, therefore,
at one blow to the level of a pulpit moralist, or mere applier of moral laws to human actions.
And in a function so exceedingly humble, philosophically considered, how could he pretend to
precedency in respect of anybody, unless it were the amen clerk, or the sexton?

In reality, however, the case is worse, If a man did really bring all human actions under the
light of any moral system whatever, provided that he could do so sternly, justly, and without
favor this way or that, he would perform an exemplary service, such as no man ever has performed.
And this is what we mean by casuistry, which is the application of a moral principle to the
cases arising in human life. A case means a genuine class of human acts, but differentiated
in the way that law cases are. For we see that every case in the law courts conforms in the
major part to the genuine class; but always, or nearly always, it presents some one differential
feature peculiar to itself; and the question about it always is, Whether the differential feature
is sufficient to take it out of the universal rule, or whether, in fact, it ought not to disturb
the incidence of the legal rule? This is what we mean by casuistry. All law in its practical
processes is a mode of casuistry. And it is clear that any practical ethics, ethics applied
to the realities of life, ought to take the professed shape of casuistry. We do not evade the
thing by evading the name. But because casuistry under that name, has been chiefly cultivated
by the Roman Catholic Church, we Protestants, with our ridiculous prudery, find a stumbling-block
in the very name. This, however, is the only service that can be rendered to morality among
us. And nothing approaching to this has been attempted by Pope.

What is it, then, that he has attempted? Certainly he imagines himself to have done something
or other in behalf of moral philosophy. For in a well-known couplet he informs us--

'That not in Fancy's maze he lingered long, But stooped to Truth, and moralized his song.'

Upon these lines a lady once made to me this very acute and significant remark. The particular
direction, she said, in which Pope fancied that he came upon Truth, showed pretty clearly what
sort of truth it was that he searched after. Had he represented Fancy, as often is done, soaring
aloft amongst the clouds, then, because Truth must be held to lie in the opposite direction,
there might have been pleaded a necessity for descending upon Truth, like one who is looking
for mushrooms. But as Fancy, by good luck, is simply described as roaming about amongst labyrinths,
which are always constructed upon dead levels, he had left it free for himself to soar after
Truth into the clouds. But that was a mode of truth which Pope cared little for; if she chose
to go galavanting amongst the clouds, Pope, for his part, was the last person to follow her.
Neither was he the man to go down into a well in search of her. Truth was not liable to wet
feet--but Pope was. And he had no such ardor for Truth as would ever lead him to forget that
wells were damp, and bronchitis alarming to a man of his constitution.

Whatever service Pope may have meditated to the philosophy of morals, he has certainly performed
none. The direct contributions which he offered to this philosophy in his 'Essay on Man,' are
not of a nature to satisfy any party; because at present the whole system may be read into
different, and sometimes into opposite meanings, according to the quality of the integrations
supplied for filling up the chasms in the chain of the development. The sort of service, however,
expected from Pope in such a field, falls in better with the style of his satires and moral
epistles than of a work professedly metaphysical. Here, however, most eminently it is that
the falseness and hypocrisy which besieged his satirical career have made themselves manifest;
and the dilemma for any working-man who should apply himself to these sections of Pope's writings
is precisely this: Reading them with the slight and languid attention which belongs to ordinary
reading, they will make no particular discoveries of Pope's hollowness and treacherous infidelities
to the truth, whether as to things or persons; but in such a case neither will they reap any
benefit. On the other hand, if they so far carry out Lord Carlisle's advice as to enter upon
the study of Pope in the spirit of earnest students, and so as really to possess themselves
of the key to his inner mind, they will rise from their labors not so much in any spirit of
gratitude for enlarged and humanizing views of man, as in a spirit of cynical disgust at finding
that such views can be so easily counterfeited, and so often virtually betrayed.

[The paper of last month, [Footnote 7] on Lord Carlisle's lecture, having been written under
the oppression of a nervous illness, accompanied by great suffering, may probably enough have
been found heavy. Another objection to that paper is, that it too easily assumes the radical
falseness, of Pope, as a notorious fact needing no evidence or illustration. To myself it did
not need either. But to any casual reader, whose attention had never been attracted to the
circumstantialities of Pope's satiric sketches, this assumption would be startling; and it
would have done him a service to offer a few exemplifications of the vice attributed to Pope,
both as substantiating the charge, and as investing it with some little amusement. This it
had been my intention to do at the moment; but being disabled by the illness above-mentioned,
I now supply the omission.]

Whom shall we pronounce a fit writer to be laid before an auditory of working-men, as a model
of what is just in composition--fit either for conciliating their regard to literature at first
or afterwards for sustaining it? The qualifications for such a writer are apparently these
two: first, that he should deal chiefly with the elder and elementary affections of man, and
under those relations which concern man's grandest capacities;--secondly, that he should treat
his subject with solemnity, and not with sneer--with earnestness, as one under a prophet's
burden of impassioned truth, and not with the levity of a girl hunting a chance-started caprice.
I admire Pope in the very highest degree; but I admire him as a pyrotechnic for producing brilliant
and evanescent effects out of elements that have hardly a moment's life within them. There
is a flash and a startling explosion, then there is a dazzling coruscation, all purple and
gold; the eye aches under the suddenness of a display that, springing like a burning arrow
out of darkness, rushes back into darkness with arrowy speed, and in a moment all is over.
Like festal shows, or the hurrying music of such shows--

'It was, and it is not.'

Untruly, therefore, was it ever fancied of Pope, that he belonged by his classification to
the family of the Drydens. Dryden had within him a principle of continuity which was not satisfied
without lingering upon his own thoughts, brooding over them, and oftentimes pursuing them through
their unlinkings with the sequaciousness (pardon a Coleridgian word) that belongs to some process
of creative nature, such as the unfolding of a flower. But Pope was all jets and tongues of
flame; all showers of scintillation and sparkle. Dryden followed, genially, an impulse of his
healthy nature. Pope obeyed, spasmodically, an overmastering febrile paroxysm. Even in these
constitutional differences between the two are written and are legible the corresponding necessities
of 'utter falsehood in Pope, and of loyalty to truth in Dryden.' Strange it is to recall this
one striking fact, that if once in his life Dryden might reasonably have been suspected of
falsehood, it was in the capital matter of religion. He ratted from his Protestant faith; and
according to the literal origin of that figure he ratted; for he abjured it as rats abjure
a ship in which their instinct of divination has deciphered a destiny of ruin, and at the very
moment when Popery wore the promise of a triumph that might, at any rate, have lasted his time.
Dryden was a Papist by apostasy; and perhaps, not to speak uncharitably, upon some bias from
self-interest. Pope, on the other hand, was a Papist by birth, and by a tie of honor; and he
resisted all temptations to desert his afflicted faith, which temptations lay in bribes of
great magnitude prospectively, and in persecutions for the present that were painfully humiliating.
How base a time-server does Dryden appear on the one side!--on the other, how much of a martyr
should we be disposed to pronounce Pope! And yet, for all that, such is the overruling force
of a nature originally sincere, the apostate Dryden wore upon his brow the grace of sincerity,
whilst the pseudo-martyr Pope, in the midst of actual fidelity to his Church, was at his heart
a traitor--in the very oath of his allegiance to his spiritual mistress had a lie upon his
lips, scoffed at her whilst kneeling in homage to her pretensions, and secretly forswore her
doctrines whilst suffering insults in her service.

The differences as to truth and falsehood lay exactly where, by all the external symptoms,
they ought not to have lain. But the reason for this anomaly was, that to Dryden sincerity
had been a perpetual necessity of his intellectual nature, whilst Pope, distracted by his own
activities of mind, living in an irreligious generation, and beset by infidel friends, had
early lost his anchorage of traditional belief; and yet, upon an honorable scruple of fidelity
to the suffering church of his fathers, he sought often to dissemble the fact of his own scepticism,
which yet often he thirsted ostentatiously to parade. Through a motive of truthfulness he became
false. And in this particular instance he would, at any rate, have become false, whatever had
been the native constitution of his mind. It was a mere impossibility to reconcile any real
allegiance to his church with his known irreverence to religion. But upon far more subjects
than this Pope was habitually false in the quality of his thoughts, always insincere, never
by any accident in earnest, and consequently many times caught in ruinous self-contradiction.
Is that the sort of writer to furnish an advantageous study for the precious leisure, precious
as rubies, of the toil-worn artisan?

The root and the pledge of this falseness in Pope lay in a disease of his mind, which he (like
the Roman poet Horace) mistook for a feature of preternatural strength; and this disease was
the incapacity of self-determination towards any paramount or abiding principles. Horace, in
a well-known passage, had congratulated himself upon this disease as upon a trophy of philosophic
emancipation:

   'Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri,
   Quo me cunque rapit tempestas, deferor liospes:'

which words Pope thus translates, and applies to himself in his English adaptation of this
epistle:--

  'But ask not to what doctors I apply--
  Sworn to no master, of no sect am I.
  As drives the storm, at any door I knock;
  And house with Montaigne now, or now with Locke.'

That is, neither one poet nor the other having, as regarded philosophy, any internal principle
of gravitation or determining impulse to draw him in one direction rather than another, was
left to the random control of momentary taste, accident, or caprice; and this indetermination
of pure, unballasted levity both Pope and Horace mistook for a special privilege of philosophic
strength. Others, it seems, were chained and coerced by sertain fixed aspects of truth, and
their efforts were overruled accordingly in one uniform line of direction. But they, the two
brilliant poets, fluttered on butterfly-wings to the right and the left, obeying no guidance
but that of some instant and fugitive sensibility to some momentary phasis of beauty. In this
dream of drunken eclecticism, and in the original possibility of such an eclecticism, lay the
ground of that enormous falsehood which Pope practised from youth to age. An eclectic philosopher
already, in the very title which he assumes, proclaims his self-complacency in the large liberty
of error purchased by the renunciation of all controlling principles. Having severed the towing-line
which connected him with any external force of guiding and compulsory truth, he is free to
go astray in any one of ten thousand false radiations from the true centre of rest. By his
own choice he is wandering in a forest all but pathless,

and a forest not of sixty days' journey, like that old Hercynian forest of Caesar's time, but
a forest which sixty generations have not availed to traverse or familiarize in any one direction.

For Horace, as I have endeavored to explain in the note, the apology is so much the readier
as his intrusions into this province of philosophy are slighter, more careless, and more indirect.
But Pope's are wilful, premeditated, with malice aforethought; and his falsehoods wear a more
malignant air, because they frequently concern truth speculative, and are therefore presumably
more deliberate in their origin, and more influential in the result. It is precisely this part
of Pope's errors that would prove most perplexing to the unlearned student. Beyond a doubt
the 'Essay on Man' would, in virtue of its subject, prove the most attractive to a laboring
man of all Pope's writings, as most of all promising a glimpse into a world of permanence and
of mysterious grandeur, and having an interest, therefore, transcendent to any that could be
derived from the fleeting aspects of manners or social conventionalisms, though illuminated
and vivified by satire. Here would be the most advantageous and remunerative station to take
for one who should undertake a formal exposure of Pope's hollow-heartedness; that is, it would
most commensurately reward the pains and difficulties of such an investigation. But it would
be too long a task for this situation, and it would be too polemic. It would move through a
jungle of controversies. For, to quote a remark which I once made myself in print, the 'Essay
on Man' in one point resembles some doubtful inscriptions in ancient forms of Oriental languages,
which, being made up elliptically of mere consonants, can be read into very different senses
according to the different sets of vowels which the particular reader may choose to interpolate.
According to the choice of the interpreter, it may be read into a loyal or a treasonable meaning.
Instead of this I prefer, as more amusing, as less elaborate, and as briefer, to expose a few
of Pope's personal falsehoods, and falsehoods as to the notorieties of fact. Truths speculative
oftentimes, drives its roots into depth so dark, that the falsifications to which it is liable,
though detected, cannot always be exposed to the light of day--the result is known, but not
therefore seen. Truth personal, on the other hand, may be easily made to confront its falsifier,
not with refutation only, but with the visible shame of refutation. Such sharoe would settle
upon every page of Pope's satires and moral epistles, oftentimes upon every couplet, if any
censor, armed with an adequate knowledge of the facts, were to prosecute the inquest. Apd the
general impression from such an inquest would be, that Pope never delineated a character, nor
uttered a sentiment, nor breathed an aspiration, which he, would not willingly have recast,
have retracted, have abjured or trampled under foot with the curses assigned to heresy, if
by sueh an act he could have added a hue of brilliancy to his coloring, or a new depth to his
shadows. There is nothing he would not have sacrificed, not the most solemn of his opinions,
nor the most pathetic memorial from his personal experiences, in return for a sufficient consideration,
which consideration meant always with him poetic effect. It is not, as too commonly is believed,
that he was reckless of other people's feelings; so far from that, he had a morbid facility
in his kindness; and in cases where he had no reason to suspect any lurking hostility, he showed
even a paralytic benignity. But, simply and constitutionally, he was incapable of a sincere
thought or a sincere emotion. Nothing that ever he uttered, were it even a prayer to God, but
he had a fancy for reading it backwards. And he was evermore false, not as loving or preferring
falsehood, but as one who could not in his heart perceive much real difference between what
people affected to call falsehood and what they affected to call truth. Volumes might be filled
with illustrations; I content myself with three or four.

I. Pope felt intellectually that it was philosophic, and also that it wore an air of nobility,
not to despise poverty. Morally, however, he felt inversely: nature and the accidents of his
life had made it his necessity to despise nothing so heartily. If in any one sentiment he ever
was absolutely sincere, if there can be cited one insulated case upon which he found it difficult
to play the hypocrite, it was in the case of that intense scorn with which he regarded poverty,
and all the painful circumstances that form the equipage of poverty. To look at a pale, dejected
fellow-creature creeping along the highway, and to have reason for thinking that he has not
tasted food since yesterday--what a pang would such a sight, accompanied by such a thought,
inflict upon many a million of benign human hearts! But in Pope, left to his spontaneous nature,
such a sight and such a thought would have moved only fits of laughter. Not that he would have
refused the poor creature a shilling, but still he would have laughed. For hunger, and cold,
and poverty, appeared to him only in the light of drolleries, and too generally of scoundrelisms.
Still he was aware that some caution was requisite in giving public expression to such feelings.
Accordingly, when he came forward in gala-dress as a philosopher, he assumed the serene air
of one upon whom all such idle distinctions as rich and poor were literally thrown away. But
watch him: follow his steps for a few minutes, and the deep realities of his nature will unmask
themselves. For example, in the first book of the 'Dunciad' he has occasion to mention Dennis:--

  'And all the mighty mad in Dennis raged.'

Upon this line (the 106th) of the text he hangs a note, in the course of which he quotes a
few sentences about Dennis from Theobald. One of these begins thus: 'Did we really know how
much this poor man suffers by being contradicted,' &c.; upon which Pope thinks proper to intercalate
the following pathetic parenthesis in italics: I wish that reflection on POVERTY had been spared.'
How amiable! how pretty! Could Joseph Surface have more dexterously improved the occasion:
'The man that disparages poverty, is a man that--' &c. It is manifest, however, at a glance,
that this virtuous indignation is altogether misplaced; for 'poor' in the quotation from Theobald
has no reference whatever to poverty as the antithesis to wealth. What a pity that a whole
phial of such excellent scenical morality should thus have been uncorked and poured out upon
the wrong man and the wrong occasion! Really, this unhappy blunder extorts from me as many
tears of laughter as ever poverty extorted from Pope. Meantime, reader, watch what follows.
Wounded so deeply in his feelings by this constrained homage to poverty, Pope finds himself
unable to resettle the equilibrium in his nervous system until he has taken out his revenge
by an extra kicking administered to some old mendicant or vagrant lying in a ditch.

At line 106 comes the flourish about Dennis's poverty. Just nine lines ahead, keeping close
as a policeman upon the heels' of a thief, you come up with Pope in the very act of maltreating
Gibber, upon no motive or pretence whatever, small or great, but that he (the said Gibber)
was guilty of poverty. Pope had detected him--and this is Pope's own account of the assault--in
an overt act of poverty. He deposes, as if it were an ample justification of his own violence,
that Gibber had been caught in the very act--not of supping meanly, coarsely, vulgarly, as
upon tripe, for instance, or other offal--but absolutely in the act of not supping at all!

    'Swearing and supperless the hero sate.'

Here one is irresistibly reminded of the old story about the cat who was transformed into a
princess: she played the role with admirable decorum, until one day a mouse ran across the
floor of the royal saloon, when immediately the old instinct and the hereditary hatred proved
too much for the artificial nature, and her highness vanished over a six-barred gate in a furious
mouse-chase. Pope, treading in the steps of this model, fancies himself reconciled to poverty.
Poverty, however, suddenly presents herself, not as a high poetic abstraction, but in that
one of her many shapes which to Pope had always seemed the most comic as well as the most hateful.
Instantly Pope's ancient malice is rekindled; and in line 115 we find him assaulting that very
calamity under one name, which under another, at line 106, he had treated with an ostentatious
superfluity of indulgence.

II. I have already noticed that some of Pope's most pointed examples which he presents to you
as drawn from his own experience of life, are in fact due to jest-books; and some (offered
as facts) are pure coinages of his own brain. When he makes his miser at the last gasp so tenacious
of the worldly rights then slipping from his grasp as that he refuses to resign a particular
manor, Pope forgot that even a jest-book must govern its jokes by some regard to the realities
of life, and that amongst these realities is the very nature and operation of a will. A miser
is not, therefore, a fool; and he knows that no possible testamentary abdication of an estate
disturbs his own absolute command over it so long as he lives, or bars his power of revoking
the bequest. The moral instruction is in this case so poor, that no reader cares much upon
what sort of foundation the story itself rests. For such a story a lie may be a decent basis.
True; but not so senseless a lie. If the old miser was delirious, there is an end of his responsibilities;
and nobody has a right to draw upon him for moral lessons or warnings. If he was not delirirous,
the case could not have happened. Modelled in the same spirit are all Pope's pretended portraitures
of women; and the more they ought to have been true, as professing to be studies from life,
the more atrociously they are false, and false in the transcendent sense of being impossible.
Heaps of contradiction, or of revolting extravagance, do not verify themselves to our loathing
incredulity because the artist chooses to come forward with his arms akimbo, saying angrily,
'But I tell you, sir, these are not fancy-pieces! These ladies whom I have here lampooned are
familiarly known to me--they are my particular friends. I see them every day in the undiess
of confiding friendship. They betray all their foibles to me in the certainty that I shall
take no advantage of their candor; and will you, coming a century later, presume to dispute
the fidelity or the value of my contemporary portraits?' Yes, and upon these two grounds: first
(as to the fidelity), that the pretended portraits are delineations of impossible people; and
secondly (as to the value), that, if after all they could be sworn to as copies faithful to
the originals, not the less are they to be repelled as abnormal, and so far beyond the intelligibilities
of nature as practically to mean nothing, neither teaching nor warning. The two Duchesses of
Marlborough, for instance, Sarah and Henrietta, are atrocious caricatures, and constructed
on the desperate principle of catching at a momentary stare or grin, by means of anarchy in
the features imputed, and truculent antithesis in the expression. Who does not feel that these
are the fierce pasquinades, and the coarse pasquinades, of some malignant electioneering contest?
Is there a line that breathes the simplicity and single-heartedness of truth? Equal disgust
settles upon every word that Pope ever wrote against Lady Mary W. Montagu. Having once come
to hate her rancorously, and finding his hatred envenomed by the consciousness that Lady Mary
had long ceased to care two straws for all the malice of all the wits in Christendom, Pope
labored at his own spite, filing it and burnishing it as a hand-polisher works at the the blade
of a scymitar. For years he had forgotten to ask after the realities of nature as they existed
in Lady Mary, and considered only what had the best chance of stinging her profoundly. He looked
out for a 'raw' into which he might lay the lash; not seeking it in the real woman, but generally
in the nature and sensibilities of abstract woman. Whatever seemed to disfigure the idea of
womanhood, that, by reiterated touches, he worked into his portraits of Lady Mary; and at length,
no doubt, he had altogether obliterated from his own remembrance the true features of her whom
he so much detested. On this class of Pope's satiric sketches I do not, however, wish to linger,
having heretofore examined some of the more prominent cases with close attention.

My last paper on Pope has been taxed with exaggeration. This charge comes from a London weekly
journal (The Leader) distinguished by its ability, by its hardihood of speculation, by its
comprehensive candor, but, in my eyes, still more advantageously distinguished by its deep
sincerity. Such qualities give a special value to the courtesies of that journal; and I in
particular, as a literary man, have to thank it for repeated instances of kindness the most
indulgent on any occasion which has brought up the mention of my name. Such qualities of necessity
give a corresponding value to its censures. And accordingly, as a point of duty, I directed
my attention immediately to this censure. Whatever was still unprinted I reviewed; and whatever
struck me as open to objection I removed. And if the result after all has been that I do not
altogether concur in the criticism of The Leader, the reason is because, as upon re-examination
it strikes me, in the worst cases Pope has not left room for exaggeration. I do not see any
actual exaggeration, simply because I do not see that any exaggeration is possible. But though
I thus found myself unable sincerely to make the sacrifice of my own opinion, another sacrifice
of a different kind I have made, viz., that of half my paper. I cancelled one half--viz., that
half which was occupied with cases in Pope of disingenuousness, and perhaps of moral falsehood
or collusion with other people's falsehood, but not of falsehood atrociously literal and conscious;
meaning thus to diminish by one half the penance of those who do not like to see Pope assaulted,
although forced by uneasiness to watch the assault;--feeling with which I heartily sympathize;
and meaning, on the other hand, in justification of mylelf, to throw the reader's attention
more effectively, because more exclusively, upon such cases of frantic and moonstruck falsehood
as could allow no room for suspense or mitigation of judgment. Of these I have selected two,
one relating to the Duke of Buckingham, and the other to the history and derivation of English
literature. Generally, I believe, that to a just appreciation of Pope's falseness, levity,
and self-contradiction, it is almost essential that a reader should have studied him with the
purpose of becoming his editor. This at one time was my own purpose; and thus it was that I
became acquainted with qualities prevailing in Pope which, in the midst of my great admiration
for him, would have made such a purpose difficult of execution. For in the relation between
author and editor, any harshness of reproach on the part of the latter, or any expression of
alienation and imperfect sympathy, seems unbecoming in one who has spontaneously assumed the
office of a patronus to a client, and are uniformly painful to the reader. On this account
it is that the late Mr. Roscoe figures amongst all editors of Pope as by far the most agreeable.
He has a just tenderness for the memory and merits of the great writer whom he undertakes to
edit; this feeling keeps his annotations clear from the petulance of Joseph Warton and the
malice of Bowles; whilst, not having happened to see Pope's errors in the same light as myself,
he suffers from no conflict between his natural indulgence to intellectual splendor and his
conscientious reverence for truth.

But if the reader is shocked with Pope's false reading of phenomena, where not the circumstances
so much as the construction of the circumstances may be challenged, what must he think of those
cases in which downright facts, and incidents the most notorious, have been outrageously falsified
only in obedience to a vulgar craving for effect in the dramatic situations, or by way of pointing
a moral for the stimulation of torpid sensibilities? Take, for instance, the death of the second
Villiers, Duke of Buckingham--a story which, in Pope's version of it, has travelled into a
popularity that may be called national; and yet, the whole is one tissue of falsehoods--and
of falsehoods that must have been known for such by Pope not less than to most of his contemporary
readers. Suppose them not known, and the whole must have wanted all natural interest. For this
interest lay in the Duke's character, in his superb accomplishments and natural advantages,
in his fine person, in his vast wealth, and in the admirable versatility of his intellectual
powers, which made him alternately the idol and the terror of all circles that he approached,
which caused Lord Clarendon to tremble with impotent malice in his chancellor's robes, and
Dry den to shiver with panic under his laureate crowns. Now, wherever these features of the
case were not known, the story was no more than any ordinary death arising out of a fox-chase.
But those to whom they were known must, at the same time, have known the audacious falsehood
which disfigures the story in Pope's way of telling it. Without the personal interest, the
incidents were nothing; and with that interest, at starting, Pope's romance must have defeated
itself by its fabulous coloring. Let me recall to the reader the principal lines in this famous
description:--

  'In the worst inn's worst room, with mat half hung,
   The floors of plaster and the walls of dung,
   On once a flock-bed, but repaired with straw,
   With tape-tied curtains never meant to draw,
   The George and Garter dangling from that bed
   Where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red,
   Great Villiers lies!
Wherefore this minute and purely fanciful description of the road-side
cabaret, with its bedroom and bed? Wherefore this impertinent and
also fraudulent circumstantiality? It is, as Pope would tell you, for
the sake of impressing with more vivacity the abject poverty to which
the Duke's follies had brought him. The wretched bed, for instance,
is meant to be the exponent of the empty purse which could purchase
no better. And, for fear that you might miss this construction of the
passage, Pope himself tells you, in a prose note, that the Duke 'died
in a remote inn in Yorkshire, reduced to the utmost misery.' Being
engaged in the business of dying, it could hardly be expected that the
Duke should be particularly happy. But what Pope means you to understand
by 'misery' is poverty; the prose note simply reiterates the words,
'victor of fortune,' in the text. Now, had the truth been really so,
what moral would such a story exemplify beyond the vulgar one of
pecuniary improvidence? And yet surely this was not the cause of the
Duke's being thrown from his horse. Meantime, Pope well knew that the
whole was a ridiculous fable. The Duke had the misfortune to be fatally
injured in a fox-chase. In such an extremity, naturally, his servants
carry him into the house nearest at hand, which happens to be an
alehouse--not 'the worst,' since there was no other; nor was it possible
that, to a man of his distinction, once the lord-lieutenant of that
very East Riding, any room would be offered worse than the very best
that contained a bed. In these dreadful circumstances, it is not easy
to measure the levity which can linger upon the description of such
exquisite impertinences as the housewifely defects of the walls, the
curtains, the flock-bed, &c. But Pope was at his wit's end for a
striking falsehood. He needed for a momentary effect some tale of a
great lord, once fabulously rich, who had not left himself the price
of a halter or of a pauper's bed. And thus, for the sake of extorting
a stare of wonderment from a mob of gaping readers, he did not scruple
to give birth and currency to the grossest of legendary lies. The
Duke's death happened a few months before Pope's birth. But the last
of the Villiers family that wore a ducal coronet was far too memorable
a person to have died under the cloud of obscurity which Pope's
representation presumes. He was the most interesting person of the
Alcibiades class [Footnote 9] that perhaps ever existed; and Pope's
mendacious story found acceptance only amongst an after-generation
unacquainted with the realities of the case. There was not so much as
a popular rumor to countenance Pope. The story was a pure, gratuitous
invention of his own. Even at the time of his death, the Duke of
Buckingham was generally reputed to have sixty thousand per annum, and
chiefly from land; an income at that period absolutely without precedent
or parallel in Europe. In this there might be some exaggeration, as
usually there is in such cases. But the 'Fairfax Papers' have recently
made it manifest that Pope's tale was the wildest of fictions. The
Duke of Buckingham had, to some extent, suffered from his loyalty to
the Crown, though apparently sheltered from the main fury of the storm
by the interest of his Presbyterian father-in-law; and in his own
person he had at one time been carelessly profuse. But all this was
nothing. The sting of Pope's story requires him to have been a pauper;
and yet--O heaven and incredulous earth!--a pauper hunting upon
blood-horses, in a star and garter, and perhaps in a collar of SS! The
plain, historical truth, meanwhile, survives, that this pauper was
simply the richest man in Christendom; and that, except Aladdin (Oh,
yes; always except Aladdin of the Arabian Nights!) there never had
been a richer. And thus collapses the whole fable, like a soap-bubble
punctured by a surgeon's probe.

II. Yet even this specimen of Pope's propensity to falsehood is far from being the worst. Here
were facts scandalously distorted. Falsehoods they were; but, if it had pleased God, they might
have been truths. Next, however, comes a fiction so maniacally gross, so incoherent, and so
rife with internal contradictions, as to involve its own exposure, literally shrinking from
its own intelligible enunciation, burrowing in sentences kept aloof from the text, and calling
upon foot-notes to cover it. The case will speak for itself. Pope had undertaken to translate
the well-known epistle of Horace to Augustus Caesar; not literally, but upon the principle
of adapting it to a modern and English treatment of its topics. Caesar, upon this system, becomes
George the Second--a very strange sort of Caesar; and Pope is supposed to have been laughing
at him, which may be the color that Pope gave to the travesty amongst his private circle; otherwise
there is nothing in the expressions to sustain such a construction. Rome, with a little more
propriety, masquerades as England, and France as Greece, or, more strictly, as Athens. Now,
by such a transformation, already from the very beginning Pope was preparing for himself a
dire necessity of falsehood. And he must have known it. Once launched upon such a course, he
became pledged and committed to all the difficulties which it might impose. Desperate necessities
would arise, from which nothing but desperate lying and hard swearing could extricate him.
The impossibility of carrying through the parallel by means of genuine correspondences threw
him for his sole resource upon such as were extravagantly spurious; and apparently he had made
up his mind to cut his way through the ice, though all the truths that ever were embattled
against Baron Munchausen should oppose his advance. Accordingly about the middle of the Epistle,
a dilemma occurs from which no escape or deliverance is possible, except by an almighty falsehood.
Take the leap Pope must, or else he must turn back when half-way through. Horace had occasion
to observe that, after Rome had made a conquest of Greece by force of arms, captive Greece
retaliated upon her conqueror by another kind of victory, namely, by that of arts: [Footnote 10]--

    'Graecia capta ferum ietorera cepit, et artes
    Intulit agresti Latio.'

Now, in the corresponding case (as Pope had arranged it) between England and France, the parallel
certainly held good as far as the military conquest. England, it was undeniable, had conquered
France in that sense, as completely as ever Rome had conquered Greece or Macedon. Two English
kings had seated themselves in succession upon the throne of France--one virtually, one formally.
So far all was tight, and held water. Nothing could disturb that part of the case. But next
came the retaliatory conquest, by means of arts and letters. How was this to be dealt with?
What shadow or dream of a correspondency could be made out there? What impudence could face
that? Already, in Pope's ears, sounded the trumpet of recall; and Pope mused a, little: but
'No,' he said in effect, 'I will not turn back. Why should I? It is but one astounding falsehood
that is wanted to set me free.' I will venture to say that Mendez Pinto, the Portuguese liar,
that Sir John Mandeville, the traveller, that Baron Munchausen, the most philosophic of bold
adventurers into the back settlements of lying, never soared into such an aerial bounce, never
cleared such a rasper of a fence, as did Pope on this occasion. He boldly took it upon his
honor and credit that our English armies, in the times of Agincourt and the Regent Bedford,
found in France a real, full-grown French literature, packed it up in their baggage-wagons,
and brought it home to England. The passage from Horace, part of which has been cited above,
stands thus in the translation of Pope:--

   'We conquered France, but felt our captive's charms--
    Her arts victorious triumphed o'er our arms;
    Britain to soft refinements less a foe,
    Wit grew polite, and numbers learned to flow.'

Ten years then, before Joan of Arc's execution, [Footnote 11] viz., about 1420 (if we are to
believe Pope), or even fifteen years, France had a great domestic literature; and this unknown
literature has actually furnished a basis to our own. Let us understand clearly what it is
that Pope means to assert. For it is no easy matter to do that where a man dodges behind texts
and notes, and shuffles between verse and prose, mystifying the reader, and designing to do
so. Under the torture of cross-examination let us force Pope to explain what literature that
is which, having glorified France, became the venerable mother of a fine English literature
in an early stage of the fifteenth century? The reader, perhaps, fancies that possibly Pope
may have expressed himself erroneously only from being a little hurried or a little confused.
Not at all. I know my man better, perhaps, than the reader does; and I know that he is trying
to hoax us. He is not confused himself, but is bent upon confusing us; and I am bent upon preventing
him. And, therefore, again I ask sternly, What literature is this which very early in the fifteenth
century, as early as Agincourt, we English found prospering in France, and which, for the benefit
of the English intellect, such men as Ancient Pistol, Nym, Bardolph, Fluellen, Capt. Macmorris,
Jamy, and other well-known literati in the army of Henry V., transplanted (or, 'as the wise
it call,' conveyed) to England? Agincourt was fought in 1415; exactly four centuries before
Waterloo. That was the beginning of our domination in France; and soon after the middle of
that same fifteenth century, viz., about 1452, our domination was at an end. During that interval,
therefore, it must have been, then, or not at all, that this great intellectual revolution
worked by France upon England was begun and completed. Naturally, at this point, the most submissive
and sycophantish of Pope's friends would feel moved by the devil of curiosity, if not absolutely
by the devil of suspicion, humbly to ask for a name or two, just as a specimen, from this great
host of Anglo-Gallic wits. Pope felt (and groaned as he felt) that so reasonable a demand could
not be evaded. 'This comes of telling lies,' must have been his bitter reflection: 'one lie
makes a necessity for another.' However, he reflected that this second lie need not be introduced
into the text, where it would have the fatal effect of blowing up the whole bubble: it might
be hidden away in a foot-note. Not one person in twenty would read it, and he that did might
easily suppose the note to be some unauthorized impertinence of a foolish commentator. Secretly
therefore, silently, stealthily--so as to draw as little attention as possible--Pope introduced
into a note his wicked little brazen solution of his own wicked and brazen conundrum. France,
such was the proposition, had worked a miracle upon English ground; as if with some magician's
rod, she had called up spawn innumerable of authors, lyric, epic, dramatic, pastoral, each
after his kind. But by whom had France moved in this creation as the chief demi-urgus? By whom,
Mr. Pope? Name, name, Mr. Pope! 'Ay,' we must suppose the unhappy man to reply, 'that's the
very question which I was going to answer, if you wouldn't be so violent.' 'Well, answer it
then. Take your own time, but answer; for we don't mean to be put off without some kind of
answer.' 'Listen, then,' said Pope, 'and I'll whisper it into your ear; for it's a sort of
secret.' Now think, reader, of a secret upon a matter like this, which (if true at all) must
be known to the antipodes. However, let us have the secret. 'The secret,' replied Pope, 'is,
that some time in the reign of Charles the Second--when I won't be positive, but I'm sure it
was after the Restoration--three gentlemen wrote an eighteen-penny pamphlet.' 'Good! And what
were the gentlemen's names?' 'One was Edmund Waller, the poet; one was Mr. Go-dolphin; and
the other was Lord Dorset.' 'This trinity of wits, then, you say, Mr. Pope, produced a mountain,
price eighteen-pence, and this mountain produced a mouse.' 'Oh, no! it was just the other way.
They produced a mouse, price eighteen-pence, and this mouse produced a mountain, viz., the
total English literature.' O day and night, but this is wondrous strange! The total English
literature--not the tottle only, but the tottle of the whole, like an oak and the masts of
some great amiral, that once slept in an acorn--absolutely lying hid in an eighteen-penny pamphlet!
And what, now, might this pamphlet be about? Was it about the curing of bacon, or the sublimer
art of sowing moonshine broadcast? It was, says Pope, if you must know everything, a translation
from the French. And judiciously chosen; for it was the worst (and surely everybody must think
it proper to keep back the best, until the English had earned a right to such luxuries by showing
a proper sense of their value)--the worst it was, and by very much the worst, of all Corneille's
dramas; and its name was 'Pompey.' Pompey, was it? And so, then, from Pompey's loins we, the
whole armies of English litterateurs, grubs and eagles, are lineally descended. So says Pope.
So he must say, In obedience to his own line of argument. And, this being the case, one would
be glad to have a look at Pompey. It is hard upon us literati, that are the children of Pompey,
not to have a look at the author of our existence. But our chance of such a look is small indeed.
For Pompey, you are to understand, reader, never advanced so far as to a second edition. That
was a poor return on the part of England for Pompey's services. And my too sceptical mind at
one time inclined to doubt even Pompey's first edition; which was wrong, and could have occurred
only to a lover of paradoxes. For Warton (not Tom, but Joe) had actually seen Pompey, and records
his opinion of him, which happened to be this: that Pompey was 'pitiful enough.' These are
Joe's own words. Still, I do not see that one witness establishes a fact of this magnitude.
A shade of doubt, therefore, continues to linger over Pompey's very existence; and the upshot
is, that Pompey (not the great, but confessedly) the doubtful, eighteen-penny Pompey, but,
in any case, Pompey, 'the Pitiful,' is the Great overriding and tutelary power, under whose
inspiration and inaugurating impulse our English literature has blossomed and ripened, root,
stem, and branch, through the life-struggles of five centuries, into its present colossal proportions.

Here pause, reader, and look back upon the separate reticulations--so as, if possible, to connect
them--in this network of hideous extravagance; where as elsewhere it happens, that one villany,
hides another, and that the mere depth of the umbrage spread by fraudulent mystifications is
the very cause which conceals the extent of those mystifications. Contemplated in a languid
mood, or without original interest in the subject, that enormity of falsehood fails to strike,
which, under circumstances personally interesting, would seem absolutely incredible. The outrage
upon the intellect actually obscures and withdraws the outrage upon the facts. And, inversely,
the affronts to historical accuracy obscure the affronts to good sense. Look steadily for a
moment at the three points in the array of impeachments :--

I. In the Red-rose invasion of France, Pope assumes, as a matter of notoriety, that the English
invading force went from a land of semi-barbarism to a land of literature and refinement: the
simple fact being so conspicuously the other way, that, whilst France had no literature at
all, consequently could have nothing to give (there being no book extensively diffused in the
France of that period, except the 'De Imitatione Christi,') [Footnote 13] England, on the other
hand, had so bright a jewel to offer, that to this hour the whole of Christendom has not matched
it or approached it. Even at present, in the case so often supposed, that a man were marooned,
that is, confined (as regarded his residence) to one desert island, and marooned also as to
books, confined I mean (as regarded his reading) to one sole book, his choice (if he read English)
would probably oscillate between Shakspeare and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Now, the Canterbury
Tales had been finished about thirty-five years before Agincourt; so exquisitely false, even
in this point, is Pope's account. Against the nothing of beggarly France was even then to be
set a work which has not been rivalled, and probably will not be rivalled, on our planet.

II. In this comparison of the France and England then existing, historically Pope betrays an
ignorance which is humiliating. He speaks of France as if that name, of course, covered the
same states and provinces that it now covers. But take away from the France of this day the
parts then possessed by Burgundy--take away Alsace, and Lorraine, and Franche Compte--take
away the alien territories adjacent to Spain and Navarre--take away Avignon, &c.--take away
the extensive duchy of Britanny, &c.--and what remains of that which constituted the France
of Pope's day? But even that which did remain had no cohesion or unity as regarded any expanded
sentiment of nationality, or the possibilities of a common literature. The moral anachronisms
of Pope in this case are absolutely frightful--and the physical anachronisms of Pope also;
for the simple want of roads, by intercepting all peaceful and pleasurable intercourse, must
have intercepted all growth of nationality, unless when a rare community of selfish interest
happened to arise, as when the whole was threatened with conquest or with famine through foreign
aggression upon a part.

III. That particular section of the French literature through which, Pope pretends to think
(for think he does not) that France absolutely created our own, was the drama. Eighteen-penny
Pompey belongs to this section. Now, most unhappily, these two broad facts are emblazoned beyond
all power of impudence to darken them. The first is, that our English drama was closing,' or
actually had closed, just about the time when the French was opening. Shakspeare notoriously
died in 1616, when Corneille [Footnote 14] was yet a child of ten, and the last of Shakspeare's
great contemporary dramatists died, according to my remembrance, in 1636; and, in 1635, one
year earlier, was first performed the first successful tragedy (the 'Medea') of Corneille.
About seven or eight years after that, the Puritans officially suppressed the English drama
by suppressing the theatres. At the opening of the Parliamentary war, the elder (that is, the
immortal) English drama had finished its career. But Racine, the chief pillar of the French,
did not begin until Cromwell was dead and gone, and Charles II. was restored. So, here we have
the Asopian fable of the lamb troubling the waters for the wolf; or, in the Greek proverb,
ano potamon. The other fact is, that, as no section whatever of the French literature has ever
availed to influence, or in the slightest degree to modify, our own, it happens that the dramatic
section in particular, which Pope insists on as the galvanizing force operating upon our seers,
has been in the most signal repulsion to our own. All the other sections have been simply inert
and neutral; but the drama has ever been in murderous antagonism to every principle and agency
by which our own lives and moves. [Footnote 15] And to make this outrage upon truth and sense
even more outrageous, Pope had not the excuse of those effeminate critics, sometimes found
amongst ourselves, who recognise no special divinity in our own drama; that would have been
one great crime the more, but it would have been one inconsistency the less. For Pope had been
amongst the earliest editors of Shakspeare; he had written a memorable preface to this edition.
The edition, it is true, was shocking; and if the preface even was disfigured by concessions
to a feeble system of dramatic criticism, rhetorically it was brilliant with the expression
of a genuine enthusiasm as to Shakspeare, and a true sympathy with his colossal power.

IV. Yet even this may not be the worst. Even below this deep perhaps there opens a lower deep.
I submit that, when a man is asked for a specimen of the Agincourt French literature, he cannot
safely produce a specimen from a literature two hundred and fifty years younger without some
risk of facing a writ de lunatico inquirendo. Pompey the Pitiful (or, if the reader is vexed
at hearing him so called, let us call him, with Lord Biron, in 'Love's Labor's Lost,' 'more
than great, great Pompey--Pompey the Huge') was not published, even in France, until about
two centuries and a quarter had elapsed from Agincourt. But, as respects England, eighteen-penny
Pompey was not revealed; the fulness of time for his avatar amongst us did not arrive until
something like two hundred and sixty years had winged their flight from Agincourt. And yet
Pope's doctrine had been that, in the conquest of France, we English first met with the Prometheus
that introduced us to the knowledge of fire and intellectual arts. Is not this ghastly? Elsewhere,
indeed, Pope skulks away from his own doctrine, and talks of 'correctness' as the particular
grace for which we were indebted to France. But this will not do. In his own 'Art of Criticism,'
about verse 715, he describes 'us brave Britons' as incorrigibly rebellious in that particular.
We have no correctness, it seems, nor ever had; and therefore, except upon Sir Richard Blackmore's
principle of stealing a suit of clothes 'from a naked Pict,' it is hard to see how we need
to thank France for that which, as to us, has no existence. Then, again, Pope acquiesced at
other times in an opinion of his early friends, that not Pompey, but himself, was the predestined
patriarch of 'correctness.' Walsh, who was a sublime old blockhead, suggested to Pope that
'correctness' was the only tight-rope upon which a fresh literary performer in England could
henceforth dance with any advantage of novelty; all other tight-ropes and slack-ropes of every
description having been preoccupied by elder funambulists. Both Walsh and Pope forgot ever
once to ask themselves what it was that they meant by 'correctness;' an idea that, in its application
to France, Akenside afterwards sternly ridiculed. Neither of the two literati stopped to consider
whether it was correctness in thought, or metrical correctness, or correctness in syntax and
idiom; as to all of which, by comparison with other poets, Pope is conspicuously deficient.
But no matter what they meant, or if they meant nothing at all. Unmeaning, or in any case inconsistent,
as this talk about 'correctness' may be, we cannot allow Pope so to escape from his own hyperbolical
absurdities. It was not by a little pruning or weeding that France, according to his original
proposition, had bettered our native literature--it was by genial incubation, by acts of vital
creation. She, upon our crab-tree cudgel of Agincourt, had engrafted her own peaches and apricots--our
sterile thorn France had inoculated with roses. English literature was the Eve that, in the
shape of a rib, had been abstracted from the side of the slumbering Pompey--of unconscious
Pompey the Huge. And all at the small charge of eighteen-pence! O heavens, to think of that!
By any possibility, that the cost, the total 'damage' of our English literature should have
been eighteen-pence!--that a shilling should actually be coming to us out of half-a-crown!

  'Tantae molis erat Romanam condere gentem.'

NOTE 1.

A similar instance of a craze beyond the bounds of perfect physical sanity may be found in
Dr. Arnold's nervous paroxysm of horror on hearing St. Paul placed on a level with St. John
the Evangelist.

NOTE 2.

And by the way, as to servants, a great man may offend in two ways: either by treating his
servants himself superciliously, or secondly, which is quite reconcilable with the most paternal
behavior on his own part, by suffering them to treat the public superciliously. Accordingly,
all novelists who happen to have no acquaintance with the realities of life as it now exists,
especially therefore rustic Scotch novelists, describe the servants of noblemen as 'insolent
and pampered menials.' But, on the contrary, at no houses whatever are persons of doubtful
appearance and anomalous costume, sure of more respectful attention than at those of the great
feudal aristocracy. At a merchant's or a banker's house, it is odds but the porter or the footman
will govern himself in his behavior by his own private construction of the case, which (as
to foreigners) is pretty sure to be wrong. But in London, at a nobleman's door, the servants
show, by the readiness of their civilities to all such questionable comers, that they have
taken their lessons from a higher source than their own inexperience or unlearned fancies.

NOTE 3.

'Cape of Storms,' which should primae facie be the Cape of Terrors. But it bears a deep allegoric
sense to the bold wrestler with such terrors, that in English, and at length to all the world,
this Cape of Terrors has transfigured itself into the Cape of Good Hope.

NOTE 4.

   'Heraldic solemnities'--
    'Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare;
    Since seldom coming in the long year set,
    Like precious stones they thinly placed are,
    Or captain jewels in the carcanet.'
     Shakspeare, 52d Sonnet.

NOTE 5.

'I give and I bequeath, old Euclio said'--and the ridiculous story of the dying epicure insisting
upon having his luxurious dish brought back to his death-bed (for why not? since at any rate,
eating or not eating, he was doomed to die) are amongst the lowest rubbish of jest-books--having
done duty for the Christian and the Pagan worlds through a course of eighteen centuries. Not
to linger upon the nursery silliness that could swallow the legend of epicureanism surviving
up to the very brink of the grave, and when even the hypocrisy of medical hope had ceased to
flatter, what a cruel memento of the infirmity charged upon himself was Pope preparing whilst
he intended nothing worse than a falsehood! He meant only to tell a lie; naturally, perhaps,
saying to himself, What's one lie more or less? And behold, if his friends are to be believed,
he was unconsciously writing a sort of hieroglyphic epitaph for his own tomb-stone. Dr. Johnson's
taste for petty gossip was so keen, that I distrust all his anecdotes. That Pope killed himself
by potted lampreys, which he had dressed with his own hands, I greatly doubt; but if anything
inclines me to believe it, chiefly it is the fury of his invectives against epicures and gluttons.
What most of all he attacked as a moralist was the particular vice which most of all besieged him.

NOTE 6.

Upon this principle I doubt not that we should interpret the sayings attributed to the seven
wise men of Greece. If we regard them as insulated aphorisms, they strike us all as mere impertinences;
for by what right is some one prudential admonition separarately illuminated and left as a
solemn legacy to all posterity in slight of others equally cogent? For instance, Meden agan--nothing
in excess--is a maxim not to be neglected, but still not entitled to the exclusive homage which
is implied in its present acceptation. The mistake, meantime, I believe to be, not in the Grecian
pleiad of sages, but in ourselves, who have falsely apprehended them. The man, for instance
(Bias was it, or who?), who left me this old saw about excess, did not mean to bias me in favor
of that one moral caution; this would have argued a craze in favor of one element amongst many.
What he meant was, to indicate the radix out of which his particular system was expanded. It
was the key-note out of which, under the laws of thorough-bass, were generated the whole chord
and its affinities. Whilst the whole evolution of the system was in lively remembrance, there
needed no more than this short-hand memento for recalling it. But now, when the lapse of time
has left the little maxim stranded on a shore of wrecks, naturally it happens that what was
in old days the keystone of an arch has come to be compounded with its superfluous rubbish.

NOTE 7.

It is no matter of wonder or complaint that a paper written by a correspondent a distance of
four hundred miles, or something more, from the press, requiring, therefore, a diaulos of above
eight hundred miles for every letter and its answer, a distance which becomes strictly infinite
in the case when the correspondent sends no answer at all, should exhibit some press errors.
These, having now done their worst, I will not vex the reader or the compositor by recalling.
Only with respect to one, viz., the word genuine, which is twice printed for the true word
generic, I make an exception, as it defeats the meaning in a way that may have perplexed a
painstaking reader. Such readers are rare, and deserve encouragement. [The same diaulos which
Mr. De Quincey laments is also the cause of his present paper appearing incomplete. It will
be resumed in the next number.--Ed.]

NOTE 8.

'The two brilliant poets.' As regards Horace, it is scarcely worth while to direct the reader's
attention upon inconsistency of this imaginary defiance to philosophic authority with his profession
elsewhere of allegiance to Epicurus; for had it even been possible to direct the poet's own
attention upon it, the same spirit of frank simplicity which has converted his very cowardice,
his unmitigated cowardice (relicta non bene parmula), into one of those amiable and winning
frailties which, once having come to know it, on no account could we consent to forego--would
have reconciled us all by some inimitable picturesqueness of candor to inconsistency the most
shocking as to the fulfilment of some great moral obligation; just as from the brute restiveness
of a word (Equotuticum), that positively would not come into the harness of hexameter verse,
he has extracted a gay, laughing alias (viz., 'versu quod dicere non est'); a pleasantry which
is nowhere so well paralleled as by Southey's on the name of Admiral Tchichakoff:--

    'A name which you all must know very well,
    Which nobody can speak, and nobody can spell.'

Vain would it be to fasten any blame upon a poet armed with such heaven-born playfulness that
upon a verbal defect he raises a triumph of art, and upon a personal defect raises a perpetual
memento of smiling and affectionate forgiveness. We 'condone' his cowardice, to use language
of Doctors' Commons, many times over, before we know whether he would have cared for our condonation;
and protest our unanimous belief, that, if he did run away from battle, he ran no faster than
a gentleman ought to run. In fact, his character would have wanted its amiable unity had he
not been a coward, or had he not been a rake. Vain were it to level reproaches at him, for
whom all reproaches become only occasions of further and surplus honor. But, in fact, for any
serious purposes of Horace, philosophy was not wanted. Some slight pretence of that kind served
to throw a shade of pensiveness over his convivial revels, and thus to rescue them from the
taint of plebeian grossness. So far, and no farther, a slight coloring of philosophy was needed
for his moral musings. But Pope's case is different. The moral breathings of Horace are natural
exhalations rising spontaneously from the heart under the ordinary gleams of chance and change
in the human things that lay around him. But Pope is more ambitious. He is not content with
borrowing from philosophy the grace of a passing sanction or countersign, but undertakes to
lend her a systematic coherency of development, and sometimes even a fundamental basis. In
his 'Essay on Man,' his morals connect themselves with metaphysics. The metaphysics had been
gathered together in his chance eclectic rambles amongst books of philosophy, such as Montaigne,
Charron, and latterly amongst the fossil rubbish and debris of Bayle's Dictionary. Much also
had been suggested to his piercing intellect in conversation, especially with Lord Bolingbroke;
but not so exclusively by any means with him as the calumniators of Pope would have us suppose.
Adopt he did from all quarters, but Pope was not the man servilely to beg or to steal. It was
indispensable to his own comfort that he should at least understand the meaning of what he
took from others, though seldom indeed he understood its wider relations, or pursued its ultimate
consequences. Hence came anguish and horror upon Pope in his latter days, such as rarely can
have visited any but the deathbed of some memorable criminal. To have rejected the verba magistri
might seem well, it might look promising, as all real freedom is promising, for the interests
of truth; but he forgot that, in rejecting the master, he had also rejected the doctrine--the
guiding principle--the unity of direction secured for the inquirer by the master's particular
system with its deep internal cohesion. Coming upon his own distracted choice of principles
from opposite angles and lines of direction, he found that what once and under one aspect had
seemed to him a guiding light, and one of the buoys for narrowing the uncertainties of a difficult
navigation, absolutely under another aspect, differently approached and differently associated,
did the treacherous office of a spanselled horse, as in past days upon the Cornish and the
South Irish coast it was employed--expressly for showing false signals, and leading right amongst
breakers. That hortus siccus of pet notions, which had won Pope's fancy in their insulated
and separate existence, when brought together as parts and elements of the same system in the
elaborate and haughty 'Essay on Man,' absolutely refused to cohere. No doctoring, no darning,
could disguise their essential inter-repulsion. Dismal rents, chasms, hiatuses, gaped and grinned
in a theory whose very office and arrogant pretension had been to harmonize the dislocated
face of nature, and to do that in the way of justification for God which God had forgotten
to do for himself. How if an enemy should come, and fill up these ugly chasms with some poisonous
fungus of a nature to spread the dry rot through the main timbers of the vessel? And, in fact,
such an enemy did come. This enemy spread dismay through Pope's heart. Pope found himself suddenly
shown up as an anti-social monster, as an incendiary, as a disorganizer of man's most aspiring
hopes. 'O Heavens! What is to be done? what can be done?' he cried out. 'When I wrote that
passage, which now seems so wicked, certainly I meant something very good; or, if I didn't,
at any rate I meant to mean it.' The case was singular; if no friend of the author's could
offer a decent account of its meaning, to a certainty the author could not. Luckily, however,
there are two ways of filling up chasms; and Warburton, who had reasons best known to himself
for cultivating Pope's favor, besides considerable practice during his youth in a special pleader's
office, took the desperate case in hand. He caulked the chasms with philosophic oakum, he 'payed'
them with dialectic pitch, he sheathed them with copper and brass by means of audacious dogmatism
and insolent quibbles, until the enemy seemed to have been silenced, and the vessel righted
so far as to float. The result, however, as a permanent result, was this--that the demurs which
had once been raised (however feebly pressed) against the poem, considered in the light of
a system compatible with religion, settled upon it permanently as a sullen cloud of suspicion
that a century has not availed to dissipate.

NOTE 9.

'The most interesting person of the Alcibiades class.' But it is thoroughly characteristic
of Pope, that the one solitary trait in the Duke's career which interested him, was the fact
that a man so familiar with voluptuous splendor should have died on a flock-bed patched with
straw. How advantageously does Dryden come forward on this occasion! He, as Mr. Bayes, had
some bitter wrongs to avenge; and he was left at liberty to execute this revenge after his
own heart, for he survived the Duke by a dozen years. Yet he took no revenge at all. He, with
natural goodness and magnanimity, declined to kick the dead lion. And in the memorable lines,
all alive and trembling with impassioned insight into the demoniac versatility of the Duke's
character, how generously does he forbear every expression of scorn, and cover the man's frailties
with a mantle of comprehensive apology, and, in fact, the true apology, by gathering them together,
one and all, as the united results of some secret nympholepsy, or some sacred Pythian inspiration:--

    'Blest madman! that could every hour employ
    In something new to wish or to enjoy;

    Now all for rhyming, wenching, fiddling, drinking;
    Beside ten thousand freaks that died in thinking'

Strangely enough, the only Duke of Buckingham that interested Pope was not the Villiers that
so profoundly interested Dryden and his own generation, but in every sense a mock Duke of Buckingham,
a pantomimic duke, that is known only for having built a palace as fine as gilt gingerbread,
and for having built a pauper poem. Some time after the death of the Villiers duke, and the
consequent extinction of the title, Sheffield, Lord Mulgrave, obtained a patent creating him,
not Duke of Buckingham, but by a pawnbroker's dodge, devised between himself and his attorney,
Duke of Buckinghamshire; the ostensible reason for which, as alleged by himself, was, that
he apprehended some lurking claim to the old title that might come forward to his own confusion
at a future time, and in that case he was ready with this demur: 'You mistake, I am not ham,
but hamshire.' Such was his account of the matter. Mine is different: I tell the reason thus.
He had known the Villiers of old, he knew well how that lubricated gladiator had defied all
the powers of Chancery and the Privy Council, for months after months, once to get a 'grip'
of him, or a hawk over him. It was the old familiar case of trying to catch a pig (but in this
instance a wild boar of the forest) whose tail has been soaped. (See Lord Clarendon, not his
History but his Life.) What the Birmingham duke therefore really feared was, that the worst
room, the tawdry curtains, the flock-bed, &c., were all a pyramid of lies; that the Villiers
had not been thrown; had probably not died at all; but was only 'trying it on,' in readiness
for a great demonstration against himself; and that, in case the title of Buckingham were ever
finally given away, the Villiers would be heard clattering on horseback up the grand staircase
of the new-built Buckingham House, like the marble statue in 'Don Juan,' with a double commission
against the false duke and the Government as joint-traders in stolen goods. But if Pope were
callous to the splendor of the true Buckingham, what was it that drew him to the false one?
Pope must have been well aware that, amongst all the poetic triflers of the day, there was
not one more ripe for the 'Dunciad.' Like the jaws of the hungry grave (Acherontis avari),
the 'Dunciad' yawned for him, whilst yet only in dim conception as a remote possibility. He
was, besides, the most vain-glorious of men; and, being anxious above all things to connect
himself with the blood royal, he had conceived the presumptuous thought of wooing Queen Anne
(then the unmarried Princess Anne). Being rejected, of course, rather than have no connection
at all with royalty, he transferred his courtship to a young lady born on the wrong side of
the blanket, namely, the daughter of James II. by Miss Sedley. Her he married, and they reigned
together in great pomp over Buckingham House. But how should this have attracted Pope? The
fact, I fear is, that Pope admired him, in spite of his verses, as a man rich and prosperous.
One morning, in some of his own verses, he lodged a compliment to the Duke as a poet and a
critic: immediately the Duke was down upon him with an answering salute of twenty-one guns,
and ever afterwards they were friends. But I repeat that, in Pope's own judgment, nine out
of ten who found their way into that great menagerie of the 'Dunciad,' had not by half so well
established their right of entrance as the Duke. 

In painting these sinewy figures, full of a character of their own,
he was very wide, had an enormous success, and drew a host of less
gifted followers after him.

Frankfurt. 1857. This is one of the numerous imitations of the celebrated "Dorfgeschichten,"
by Berthold Auerbach.

The latter introduced, in a time of literary poverty, a felicitous range of new subjects for epical treatment,--
the life of German peasants, with their simple, healthy, vigorous natures
undepraved by a spurious civilization.



'Joan of Arc's execution'--viz., not by any English, but virtually by a French tribunal, as
now, at last, is satisfactorily established by the recent publication, at Paris, of the judicial
process itself in its full official records.

NOTE 12.

The notes are now (i. e., in all modern editions) assigned to their separate authors; though
not always in a way to prevent doubts. For instance, Roscoe's notes, except that they are always
distinguished by kindness and good sense, are indicated only by the absence of any distinguishing
signature. But in the early editions great carelessness prevailed as to this point, and, sometimes,
intentional dissimulation.

NOTE 13.

Which was probably not of French origin. Thomas-a-Kempis, Gerson, and others, have had the
credit of it; but the point is still doubtful. When I say that it was extensively diffused,
naturally I mean so far as it was possible before the invention of printing. One generation
after Agincourt this invention was beginning to move, after which--that is, in two generations--the
multiplication of copies, and even of separate editions and separate translations, ran beyond
all power of registration. It is one amongst the wonders of the world; and the reason I have
formerly explained. Froissart belongs to the courts of England and of Burgundy much more than
to that of France.

NOTE 14.

Hardi, it is scarcely necessary to mention; as he never became a power even in France, and
out of France was quite unknown. He coincided in point of time, I believe, most nearly with
Francis Beaumont.

NOTE 15.

Italian, Spanish, and finally German poetry have in succession exercised some slight influence,
more or less, over our English poetry. But I have formerly endeavored to show that it is something
worse than a mere historical blunder, that, in fact, it involves a gross misconception and
a confusion in the understanding, to suppose that there ever has been what has been called
a French school in our literature, unless it is supposed that the unimpassioned understanding,
or the understanding speaking' in a minor key of passion, is a French invention.
