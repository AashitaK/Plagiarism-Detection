"NAP," OR "NAPOLEON."

The game of Napoleon, or as it is more generally and popularly called "Nap," was introduced
into this country from the United States, it is believed, about 1865, although it is recorded
that the game had previously been played for high stakes at some of the more notorious gambling
clubs.

It is named after the great Napoleon, as the principal player in the game becomes, for the
time being, an Ishmaelite, whose "hand" is against every man's, and every man's against his,
as was the case with the "Grand Adventurer" in 1804-15 (see Variations)--whence we have the
terms Wellington, Blücher, etc.

It is an admirable game for three, four, or five persons, and is also available for two and
six, though four is the ideal number, and it is played with an ordinary pack of fifty-two cards.
(For Nap with thirty-two card pack, see page 14).  With six persons taking part in the game
the dealer stands out of the play, not dealing any cards to himself, though he receives and
pays for the tricks like the others, and the same system is sometimes adopted when there are
five players; as, if all the players took active part in the game, it would become most difficult
to make the tricks, because more cards would be in use.

The popularity of the game is no doubt owing to the short time necessary for playing the hands,
and to the fact [4] that it can be terminated at any moment, for no game or deal need exceed
two or three minutes, except when a pool or "kitty" is introduced (see Variations).  In this
case provision has to be made for the distribution of the amount of the kitty.

While care in playing is necessary, no great amount of skill is required to render the game
diverting as an amusement, while it also affords ample scope for the exercise of speculation
and the other elements of excitement.

DESCRIPTION.

The main idea of the play, as already stated, is for one of the competitors to stand against
the united efforts of the others, who, in turn, use their powers to prevent his securing the
object for which he is striving--in this case to win the whole or a certain number of tricks.
The number of the tricks to be won is variable, and it depends on the value of the cards in
each player's hand to decide what number he will endeavour to secure. The greatest possible
achievement is to win the whole of the tricks (which are five in number), and the player who
succeeds in doing this scores a "Nap," and receives double stakes from each of his companions;
if however, after declaring his intention to try for Nap he fails, he only pays a single, i.e.,
for five tricks; and, as will be shown later on, this condition attaching to a Nap becomes
an important feature in deciding on the number of tricks to be played for, when a good hand
is secured. 

Now the boy has grown to be a man.He comes to her in his uniform.He said "Ah,these partings!They were really
in the death-hour of their dear once.But the woman knows it.They both smiled through their tears like Andromache

With
the brave and silent hearts they both face the sequel together.Every
week The mother of Sub-Lieutenan came to recieve letter from that
little boy.That cheerful little pencil was scruggling like this "Dearest
Mother, I have dug-out now three planks and a tree of straw, and I
sleep on it like a top". or perhaps "You see they have sent me back
to the Base after six weeks under fire, and now I have a real, real
room, and a real, real bed!"

The dear old darling!


Another important matter for consideration is the number of players engaged, and the consequent
proportion of cards in use. Each player receives five cards, so that it follows, with three
players engaged, that fifteen are in use, and thirty-seven remain in the pack unexposed; whereas
if five are playing there are twenty-five cards in use, and only twenty-seven remaining unexposed.
The calculation necessary is, therefore, as to the probability of certain superior cards being
in the hands of the opponents, or remaining in the undealt surplus of the pack.

TACTICS.

As a perfect Nap is of such rarity we must content ourselves with substitutes, and in this
respect we may regard the following combinations as good ordinary hands on which to declare
for the full number of tricks: a flush of fairly high cards, i.e., the five all of one suit;
four of one suit (headed with ace or king), and one high card of another suit; or three high
cards of one suit, with two high cards of a second suit. It is dangerous to risk a Nap on a
hand of three suits, unless it consists of three high cards of one suit with two other aces;
then it is often possible to [6] win the five tricks, by first exhausting the trumps, and then
playing the aces, which must win; but if one of the opponents starts with four trumps, no matter
how small, success is, of course, impossible.

If a player does not consider his cards good enough to permit of his declaring for Nap--and
it is fair to suppose that not once in a hundred they will be absolutely safe--he has to decide
what they are worth, and declare accordingly.  It is not often that four tricks are called,
because a hand good enough for four is usually regarded as sufficiently good for Nap, on account
of the additional stakes received by the player who succeeds in making the whole of the tricks,
which amount to a difference of six points from each competitor, as for four tricks he receives
four, while for Nap he receives ten, paying only five, however, if he loses.

On the same principle as already shown in regard to a "perfect" Nap, it will be understood
that ace, king, queen, is the only certain combination with which to secure three tricks, but
these cards, again, are seldom met with in a hand, and speculation is once more the principal
matter for consideration.  Ace, knave, and ten of a suit is generally good for three tricks,
as the only possibility against such a combination is that one of the other players holds king
or queen of the same suit, with a smaller trump to throw away when the ace is led.  Three tricks
are, however, often called on much lower cards than ace, knave, ten, especially when the other
cards in the hand are of one suit, or are sufficiently high to admit of the possibility of
one of them securing a trick.  The same line of reasoning holds good in regard to a declaration
of two tricks, the only certainty in that case being ace and king.

It must not be considered, after these comments on the game, that there is any great difficulty
to surmount in acquiring [7] a knowledge of Napoleon. As we said at the commencement of our
remarks no great skill is essential, but considerable care is necessary to secure anything
like success at the game, the chief factor in which is so-called luck.  It is impossible to
make tricks, or even declare an intention to try for them, unless one receives a certain number
of high cards.  One may even go further, and say that luck goes far beyond the actual cards
dealt to each player, for the best of hands often fail, and poor cards frequently achieve success;
whilst it happens, in numerous cases, that the playing of the cards demonstrates that really
weak hands would have secured success if the holder had had the pluck, or impudence, we may
term it, to declare more than the value of the cards seemed to justify.  On the other hand
it is often astonishing to find the number of high cards of a given suit included among the
fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five in the hands of the players engaged in the game.

Taking all matters into consideration, it must be regarded as virtually impossible to give
any precise rules for deciding the number of tricks to declare, and it is equally difficult
to lay down any definite plan for playing the cards to the tricks. We can only generalize for
the information of our readers, who must decide for themselves whether they will play an adventurous
game, with its greater risks, and greater possibilities of success; or whether they will adopt
a quieter and less speculative course, standing to win or lose less on their own declarations.

It must always be borne in mind, however, that whichever course is pursued it is only his own
actions that can be governed by each player.  One may adopt a quiet, safe game, and risk little,
while some or all of the opponents may adopt the opposite extreme, and force all the competitors,
[8] in a manner of speaking, to share in their risky speculations. If the bold player wins,
and we think the chances are in his favour, the quieter ones, no matter how safe their own
declarations may be, must necessarily lose, and vice versâ so that we have, not only the numberless
possible combinations of the cards to consider, but also the temperament and position of those
engaged in each game.

Care should be taken to remember, as far as possible, the cards thrown away by the other players,
when they cannot follow suit to any particular lead, and it will be found in practice that
much information can be derived as to the character of the remaining cards from a careful study
of the hands during the progress of the play, and this knowledge is particularly valuable when
a player is left with two cards of equal, or nearly equal value, and his chance of success
depends upon his winning a trick with one of them.

We shall now proceed to consider the various parts of the game, and the variations that have
been introduced into the method of playing it.

STAKES.

The stakes may consist of any amount previously arranged, and whatever is decided upon, whether
it be counters or money, is recognised as the limit per trick, only changed when a player having
declared for Nap, succeeds in making it, in which case each player pays double, or as though
he had lost ten tricks.  In other cases the players win or lose one stake for each trick that
the senior hand has declared for.  Say, for example, he declared to win three tricks, and succeeded,
then each of the other players would pay him three times the amount of the stake; if the senior
hand did not succeed, he would have to pay a similar amount to each of the others.

[9]

DEALING.

The deal is decided by the cards being turned face upwards before each player, until the first
knave is exposed.  The player to whom the knave falls then becomes the first dealer.  It is
better to play with two separate packs of cards, as considerable time is saved in collecting
and shuffling, which operations are to be performed by the player on the next dealer's left
hand side.  When shuffled the cards are to be placed on the right hand side of the dealer,
where they are to be left until the player on his right cuts them.  The dealer distributes
five cards to each player, going from left to might, and dealing the cards one at a time.

As the deal is a disadvantage, inasmuch as the dealer has the last call, there is no penalty
attaching to a misdeal, unless the game is being played with the addition of a pool or kitty
(see page 11), in which case the player making a misdeal pays a penalty to the pool equal to
the stake of one trick.  In the event of a misdeal, or accidental exposure of a card, the whole
pack must be collected, shuffled and re-cut, as before, after which the cards are to be re-dealt
by the same player who made the mistake. The players must not interfere with the cards during
the deal, under a similar penalty, nor touch the remainder of the pack when once it has left
the dealer's hands.

CALLING.

The deal having been completed the players are entitled to look at their cards, and then declare,
in turn, whether they will "stand" or "pass," the player on the dealer's left having the first
call.  If he decide to stand he declares the number of tricks he will stand for, while if he
elects to pass [10] he simply states his intention of so doing, but it is understood that the
first caller must stand for one trick, should all the others decide to pass, except in the
case where the Double Header is agreed to (see page 13).  The next player then announces his
intention.  If he cannot stand for more tricks than have already been called he must pass,
and the same holds good all round, until the dealer is reached.  No player may make a second
declaration, or alter one once made.

PLAYING THE HANDS.

The player who has called the highest number of tricks now becomes senior hand, and his object
is to make the tricks he has declared, in opposition to the united efforts of the other players,
who combine --without consultation or arrangement of any kind--to defeat his purpose. The senior
hand may make trumps of any suit he chooses, and this he signifies by leading one of the suit
he selects.  It will thus be seen that the first card played in each deal decides the trumps
for that deal.

The player on the left of the leader then follows.  If he has a card of the suit led he must
play it, but if not he may throw off any card he chooses. If he has more than one card of the
suit he can play either, as he is not forced to head the trick even if he has a card higher
than that led but in practice it is seldom desirable to pass a trick in the first round, when
headed by the senior hand, except under exceptional circumstances, such for instance as holding
ace and a small one, with knave or a lower card led.

Provided no player has headed the trick, i.e., played a higher card of the same suit as the
one led, the trick is scored by the senior hand, and he leads for the second [11] round.  If,
however, one of the players has taken the trick, then the lead passes to the winner of that
trick, and the same occurs after the second, third and fourth tricks.

In the second and subsequent rounds the leader may play whatever card he chooses, just as in
the first, the trumps remaining unaltered.  A player having one of the suit led in either round
must play it, but if he has none of the suit he may either discard one of the others, or head
the trick by playing a trump. This continues throughout the five rounds, unless the senior
hand shall have previously won the number of tricks he declared, or shall have lost such a
number as to render his success impossible, in either of which cases the cards are collected
for the next deal.

VARIATIONS.

There are several innovations and different methods of play which may be introduced into the
game of Napoleon, but any divergence from the plain game should be carefully settled by the
company before the play is commenced.  Failing a proper understanding on this point, the rules
applicable to the simple game must be adhered to.

POOL OR KITTY.

When a pool is agreed to, payment is made by each dealer according to the value of the stake
of the game, but it is more convenient for all of the players to pay in when it is the original
dealer's turn to play. The Kitty thus formed becomes the property of the caller who makes Nap,
and he takes it in addition to the double stakes he [12] receives from each player, as already
mentioned.  When it is found desirable to conclude the game before a Nap has been secured,
the amount of the kitty is to be equally divided between the players, or it may be drawn for,
in which case a card is distributed to each player by the regular dealer, who has the cards
properly shuffled and cut for the purpose, when the holder of the lowest card (ace here reckoning
as highest) takes the pool.

MISERY OR MISÉRE.

This is the most common variation, and is the antithesis of Napoleon, inasmuch as the caller
must not make a single trick.  The caller leads off in the ordinary way--the suit led being
trumps, as usual, unless it is agreed, as is sometimes done, that there shall be no trumps
in this variation.  The caller of misére must always follow suit, if he can, but is not obliged
to trump if he has none of the suit led.  He must, however, play the cards so as to avoid taking
a trick.  Should he be compelled to win one of the tricks, or should his original lead remain
unheaded by any of the other players, then he fails in his declaration, and has to pay, but
if he avoids making a trick, the other players have to pay him.  The usual stake for "misery,"
either for winner or loser, is three; but any player declaring he can make three tricks takes
precedence, and plays accordingly.

BUYING CARDS.

After the cards have been distributed, but before any declaration has been made, the dealer
asks each player in turn, beginning with the player on his left, whether he wishes to buy a
card or cards.  The player wishing to purchase must first throw away the cards he desires to
eject, [13] face downwards, and must place in the pool the value of one trick for each card
he desires to receive from the dealer.  The card or cards must be taken from the top of the
pack, and handed unexposed to the player.

SPARE HAND.

An extra hand is dealt, which each player in turn has the option of adding to his own hand,
selecting from the ten cards thus held five with which to play, but he must then stand for
Nap, and, if there is a pool or kitty, he must put therein the value of two tricks if he fails
to score, in addition to paying each of the players the ordinary stake on losing five tricks.

DOUBLE HEADER.

If each player "passes," then the stakes for the next deal are doubled, and remain so until
the person declaring has won. In cases where this variation is decided upon, it is usual to
agree that the lowest call be "three," so that the double header occurs at frequent intervals.

WELLINGTON.

If a player calls Napoleon, and another player on his left considers he can also make five
tricks, he may call "Wellington," in which case the stakes are doubled, the caller winning
20 or losing 10.  As this rule, however, is regarded with disfavour by some, in consequence
of its raising the limit of a loss on any particular hand from 10 to 20, it is sometimes played
differently.  The player who calls Wellington does not receive more than he would have done
for Napoleon, but pays double, i.e., 10.

[14]

BLÜCHER.

This is called in the same manner, that is to say over the player calling Wellington, and then
the stakes are trebled, the caller winning 30 or losing 15.

In the modification of this variety, as referred to in connection with Wellington, the caller
would still only receive 10 for winning, but would pay 15 to each player if he lost.  This
may appear a severe penalty, but it must be remembered that both Wellington and Blücher are
declarations outside the ordinary limit of the game, and it is not possible for the first caller
to claim them, even though he may have the first five cards of a suit, and therefore be certain
of winning everything.  He calls Napoleon as the limit allowed by the game, and it is therefore
unfair that he should lose the advantages of his good hand.

Another variety of this game is to allow the caller of Napoleon the opportunity of altering
his call to Wellington or Blücher if challenged by any of the others to do so.  If he thinks
he can scare he stands for the higher call; if not, then the player who challenges him does so.

The settlement of these extended calls should be particularly agreed upon before commencing
play, or disagreement is all but inevitable, as the player who insists on the forced increase
of the limit is certainly in the wrong, unless arrangement has previously been made.

THIRTY-TWO CARD PACKS.

If Piquet or Bézique cards are used, i.e., packs with the 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of each suit omitted--leaving
but 32 cards in the set--the ordinary rules are observed.  When playing with this smaller pack
the hands will apparently be of far [15] greater value than usual.  This arises from the fact
that all the lower cards of each suit are omitted, and after a few deals it will be found very
difficult to make even a small number of tricks with hands which, if a full pack of cards was
in use, would be exceptionally good.  There being but thirty-two cards to deal with, the number
of players must not exceed three, or perhaps four.

SIX- OR SEVEN-CARD NAP.

In this variation six or seven cards are dealt to each player, who, before making his call,
has to throw away (face downwards and unexposed) one or two, as the case may be, of his cards,
so as to leave the number in his hand five, when the game is played on the regular lines.

NINE-CARD NAP.

This may be described as the last innovation in the game. It is conducted on exactly similar
lines to the five card method, except that nine cards are held by each player, none being discarded
as in the last mentioned variation, but it has not yet become popular, and in view of the fact
that even with only three players more than half the pack is in use, its scope is far more
limited than any other variety.  In this variation the person calling Nap would have to make
all nine tricks, a most difficult and very unfrequent occurrence.  It will be found to be a
pleasing variety for two players who are of about equal skill at the ordinary game, its possibilities
being so different from that method, but we doubt its ever being made as popular as the five
card game.

[16]

LOO.

Loo (or, as formerly it was sometimes called, Lue) is a very lively and popular round game,
justly described as one of the best and yet one of the simplest known.  Indeed, until the introduction
of "Nap," it was the most fashionable of its class in this country.  The date of its origin
is not on record, but that some amount of antiquity can be claimed for it may be inferred from
the fact that a description of the game appears in works published at the beginning of the
present century, when the method of playing it was virtually the same as is recognised at the
present day, except that then the five-card variation was the most popular, whereas now the
three-card game is in vogue.

Loo is usually played with an ordinary pack of fifty-two cards, but in some variations the
thirty-two card pack is used.  The number of players who can take part in it is practically
unlimited within the range of the pack played with.  A writer of thirty years since justly
remarks that the game is good for any number up to a dozen, although the best game is played
with five, or not more than seven persons.  Five players are sometimes regarded as the limit,
and if more than that number desire to take part, relief is sought by the dealer standing out
of the play, neither paying nor receiving on the tricks of that hand. This arrangement, however,
is one that can be decided at the option of the company playing.

[17]

As is the case with Nap, a very short time is necessary for completing the hands in the game,
and a finish may be made at any moment, either by an equal division of the amount in the pool
among the players, or by releasing those who failed to win a trick in the previous deal from
the penalty which usually attaches to such a result, and which is known as a "loo."  In this
case all "stand" on the last round, and there is no "miss." It is usual, however, to play on
until what is known as a "single" occurs, i.e., when each of the players who declared to stand
has secured a trick, and, as a consequence, no one has been looed.  If, however, a finish is
desired before a single occurs, it is best to arrange it so as to fall immediately before the
original dealer's turn to deal comes round again, as, in that case, all the players will have
paid for an equal number of deals.

A player may withdraw from the game at any time when it is his turn to deal.  In that case
he pays for his deal (as explained later on), and also for his loo, if he was looed the previous
hand, but he does not deal any cards to himself, or take any part in the play of that round.

DESCRIPTION.

Three-card Loo being the most popular at the present day, we shall devote ourselves more particularly
to that game, leaving the five-card variety to be considered later on, under the heading of
Variations.  The object of each player is to win one, two, or all of the three tricks into
which each deal is divided, and in doing so he is opposed by all the other players who have
elected to stand, and who, in turn, try to secure the tricks for themselves.

The stakes are first decided on--usually three counters [18] or coins for the deal, and six
for a loo.  It is desirable that the amount in the pool should be divisible by three, so as
to allow of its equal apportionment among the winners of the three tricks.  The first dealer
is then chosen, and he, having paid to the pool the agreed amount for his deal, proceeds to
distribute the cards for what is termed a single, a term denoting that merely the dealer's
stake is to be played for.

The pack having been duly shuffled and cut, the dealer turns the top card face upwards in the
middle of the table, and then distributes one card, similarly exposed, to each player.  If
either of the players receives a higher card of the same suit as the one turned up, he wins
the amount in the pool.  If two or more receive superior cards, the higher takes the stake.
The others are looed, each having to contribute the agreed amount of a loo to the pool, for
the next deal.  It is usually agreed that the penalty for a loo on the single shall be half
the amount of the ordinary loo, or the same amount as for a deal.  If neither player receives
a higher card of the same suit as that turned up all are looed, and the amount in the pool
remains, being included in the stakes for the next deal.  The amount of the loos having been
placed in the pool, as also the sum agreed upon to be contributed by the next dealer, the cards
are re-gathered, shuffled, and cut, and the second deal is proceeded with. Three cards are
distributed to each player, and a spare hand, or miss, as it is generally called,¹ is left
in the middle of the table. The top [19] card of the undealt portion of the pack is next turned
up, to decide which of the suits shall be trump, and then each of the players --commencing
with the one on the left hand side of the dealer--in turn looks at his cards, and decides whether
he will stand, whether he will take the miss, or whether he will throw up his cards for that
deal, unless the rule for "Club Law" shall have been previously decided upon, when all the
players have to stand, and the miss is withdrawn--see page 26.  If he decides to stand, the
player retains the three cards originally dealt him, and says, "I play"; if he elects to throw
up his cards, he places them, unexposed, on the top of the undealt portion of the pack, and
takes no share in the remainder of that hand, neither paying nor receiving in connection with
the play; while if he determines to take the miss, his original cards are added to the undealt
portion of the pack, as before, and he takes up the spare hand.  In this latter case he is
compelled to stand, that is, it is not optional with him to throw up the miss, when once he
has elected to take it.

   ¹ The spare hand is not always called the "miss."  Some players
     designate it the "cat"; the term possibly originating from its
     un-certainty; hence the expression, often used in connection
     with the spare hand--"Let us hope she will not scratch us."

The player on the dealer's left having determined which course he will pursue, the one on his
left has to decide, and so on, until the dealer is reached; he may, in like manner, stand,
throw up, or take miss, provided the spare hand has not already been appropriated.  If none
of the players take the miss it is added to the pack, but in that case it must not be exposed,
or looked at by any of the players.

Should it happen that each of the players in front of the dealer has thrown up his own cards,
and neither has taken the miss, then the dealer is entitled to the amount in the pool, no matter
what his cards are. Should it happen that only one player has declared to stand on his own
hand, [20] then the dealer, if he cannot stand on his own cards, may take the miss.  If he
does not care to do either he must play the miss for the benefit of the pool, against the single
player who declared to play on his own cards, and anything he may then win with the miss is
left in the pool for the next deal.  These contingencies are seldom, if ever, met with in actual
play, but being possible it is necessary to fix laws to govern them.

The players who have decided to stand, either on their own cards, or on the miss, then proceed
to play the tricks, the one nearest the dealer's left having to lead.  It is, however, sometimes
agreed that the holder of miss for the time being shall lead, but this is hardly a desirable
departure from the more regular course of leaving the lead to the elder hand, and we cannot
recommend its adoption.  If the leader holds the ace of trumps he must lead it, and similarly,
if the ace is turned up, and he holds the king, he must start off with that card.  If he has
two or three trumps (of any denomination) he must lead the highest.  "Two or more trumps, lead
one," is the rule of some players, but unless this matter is specially decided upon before
the commencement of play the rule to lead the highest of two or three must govern the point.
In all other cases the leader may start off with whichever card he chooses.

The play proceeds from left to right, and each player, in turn, has to follow suit if he can;
as it is his desire to secure the trick for himself he will play as high as possible [21] if
he has the power to head the trick.  If he cannot follow suit he must play a trump if he has
one, provided his trump is higher than any previously played to the trick, but it is not compulsory
to trump a suit when it is not possible to head the trick by doing so.  Failing the ability
to head the trick, he may discard as he chooses.  It is compulsory, however, for each player,
in turn, to head the trick if he is able to do so, and herein lies one of the greatest differences
between Loo and Nap, for in the latter game, as we have shown, it is optional with a player
whether he will head the trick, or pass it.  The trick is won by the player who plays the highest
of the suit led, or, if trumped, the highest trump.  As winner, he has the privilege of leading
for the next trick, which is conducted on similar lines to the first.  This applies also to
the third trick, the only stipulations being that if the player who won the first trick has
a trump he must lead it, and if he be left with two trumps he must play the higher of the two
as the lead for the second trick.  The three tricks having been disposed of the amount in the
pool is divided equitably among the winners, while those who stood--either on their own hand
or on miss,--and did not succeed in winning a trick are looed.  If all who stood succeeded
in making one or more tricks, so that neither of the players was looed, it becomes a single
again, and the cards are dealt as already described for that round (see p. 18).

A player infringing any of the rules, or playing in an irregular manner, is looed, and the
amount of his winnings, if any, is left in the pool. The hands must, however, be replayed in
proper order, and if then the tricks are secured by different players, that must be considered
the result of the hand, and the losers by the proper play are looed, even though by the first
and erroneous method they secured one [22] or more of the tricks.  Briefly, no player can he
looed, or secure any part of the pool through the irregularity of either of the other players.
In any case the player who transgressed the law does not win anything. If his cards secure
one or all of the tricks the amount of his winnings is left in the pool for the next deal,
and he is looed.  This does not apply to penalties for looking at the hands, or declaring out
of turn, or making a misdeal.  In those cases the offending player pays the penalty into the
pool for the current deal, and stands an equal chance with the others in fighting for the tricks.
The cards as played are left in front of the players, not being turned or otherwise interfered
with until the completion of the three tricks, when, as already described, they are gathered
up for the next round.

We will now proceed to consider the various points of the game not touched upon in the description
already given.

STAKES.

For the reason already mentioned the stakes should be so arranged that the amount in the pool
can always be divided by three.  Thus, supposing that three counters, or coins, are fixed as
the amount for the deal, and six for a loo, there cannot possibly be any surplus after the
division among the winners of the three tricks, no matter how many may have paid in. If, however,
the pool consists of such an amount as to render equal division impossible, the division is
made as nearly equal as can be, and the winners of the first and second tricks have the preference.

It is not necessary that the loo should be twice the amount of the deal, indeed any sum may
be fixed for either the one or the other, and it is not unusual when the [23] deal is settled
at 1½d. for the loo to be 6d., or when the one is 6d. for the other to be 2s. 6d., and so on.
Another method is to make the stake for a loo unlimited, and yet another to make it somewhat
of a combination, unlimited up to a certain amount (see Variations), but the more general course
is to have a definite price fixed (a) for the deal, (b) for an ordinary loo, and (c) for a
single loo, which latter is generally half the amount of the full loo.

Before commencing play in the game, it is desirable to settle whether Club Law (see Variations)
is to be enforced, and whether any alteration is to be made in the law compelling the holder
of two or more trumps to lead the highest on the original lead. The modification of this rule
is "two or more trumps lead one."

DEALING.

The deal is settled in the same way as already described in connection with Nap, and the cards
having been shuffled and cut, the single is dealt, as described on page 18.  In other rounds
the dealer must distribute the cards to the players one card at a time, in regular order from
left to right, and must deal to the spare hand, or miss immediately after dealing his own card
each time.  With some players deviation is permitted, the dealer being allowed to distribute
the cards in any order he likes, and either singly or three at a time; or the miss is left
until last, when the three cards for the spare hand are dealt at once. But there was one difference
between the outrages of 1740 and 1914. The great barrator made no hypocritical pretence of
desiring peace.

It was reserved for Harnack and Hauptmann, not to speak of the Kaiser, to cant about the responsibilities
of "Kul-tur" (that harlot of the German dictionary, debased by all ignoble uses), about the
hastening of the kingdom of heaven, and about the German sword being sanctified by God. But the
old German Adam remained, and when, two days before the declaration of war with France, the German
soldiers were flying to the Belgian frontier there was no thought
of the Archduke Ferdinand or of the doddering old man on the Austrian
throne, whose paternal heart had been sorely wounded.

Germany was out to rob France of her colonies--to rob her, and the
Germans knew it.

"A few centuries may have to run their course," said their own poet
Goethe (who surely knew the German soul), "before it can be said of
the German people, 'It is a long time since they were barbarians.'"

Such, then, were some of the events in the great drama of the war which took place in Germany
before the rising of the curtain. Not a theologian, a philosopher, an historian, or a poet to recall
the past of his country, to warn it not to repeat the crime of a century and a half before, which
had stained its name for ever before the tribunals of man and God; not a statesman to remind a generation
that was too young to remember 1870 of the miseries and horrors of war, for (alas for the welfare
of the world!) the one great German voice that could have done so with searching and scorching eloquence
(the voice of Bebel) had only just been silenced by the grave. And so it came to pass that Germany,
in the last days of July 1914, presented the pitiful spectacle of
a great nation being lured on to its moral death-agony amid canting
appeals to the Almighty, and wild outbursts of popular joy.

A CONVERSATION WITH LORD ROBERTS

Meantime what had been happening among ourselves? The far-off murmur of the approaching wind
had been heard by all of us, but as none can hope to describe the effect on the whole Empire, perhaps
each may be allowed to indicate the character of the warning as it came to his own ears. It was
at Naples, not long after the event, that I heard how the late King had felt about his last
visit to Berlin. I was then on my way home from Egypt, where I had spent
some days at Mena, while Lord Roberts was staying there on his way
back from the Soudan.

He seemed restless and anxious. On two successive mornings I sat with him for a long hour
in the shade of the terraces which overlook the Pyramids discussing
the "German danger." After the great soldier had left for Cairo he wrote
asking me to regard our conversations as confidential; and down to
this moment I have always done so, but I see no harm now (quite the
reverse of harm) in repeating the substance of what he said so many
years ago on a matter of such infinite momentousness.

"Do you really attach importance to this scare of a German invasion?"

I asked.

"I'm afraid I do," said Lord Roberts.

"You think an enemy army could be landed on our shores?"

"As things are now, yes, I think it could."

"Do you think you could land an army on the East Coast of England
and march on to London?"

"Yes, I do."

"In a thick fog, of course?" "Without a fog," said Lord Roberts. After that
he described in detail the measures we ought to take to make such
an attack impossible and I hasten to add that, so far as I can see and
know, the precautionary measures he recommended have all been taken
since the outbreak of the war.

"WE'LL FIGHT AND FIGHT SOON"
By that time I had, in common with the majority of my countrymen
who travelled much abroad, been compelled to recognize the ever-increasing
hostility of the German and British peoples whenever they encountered
each other on the highways of the world--their constant cross-purposes
on steamships, in railway trains, hotels, casinos, post and telegraph
offices--making social intercourse difficult and friendship impossible.
The overbearing manners of many German travellers, their aggressive
and domineering selfishness, which always demanded the best seats,
the best rooms, and the first attention, was year by year becoming
more and more intolerable to the British spirit. It cannot be said
that we acquiesced. Indeed, it must be admitted that our country-people
usually met the German claims to be the supermen of Europe with rather
unnecessary self-assertion.rmen of Europe with rather
unnecessary self-assertion. 6d., a player would be looed the amount in the pool,
up to the limit, but if the amount exceeded the 2s. 6d., he would not be called upon for a
larger sum.

[27]

FIVE-CARD LOO.

This is the old-fashioned game, and we may go back to old books for a description of it.  It
is said to be a much more amusing game than three-card loo for a company not inclined to play
for high stakes, but is not suitable for more than six players, even if five should not be
regarded as the limit.  Each of those engaged in the game has five cards dealt him, either
first three, and then two, or one at a time, the latter method being by far the best, and the
following card is turned up for trump.  There is no miss, but each player has the liberty of
changing, for others from the pack, all or any of the five cards dealt him, or of throwing
up the hand altogether.  If he decides to change any of his cards, the player, whose turn it
is to declare, places the cards he wishes exchanged, face downwards, on the table, and the
dealer gives him a like number from the top of the pack.  No second exchange is allowable,
nor can a card once put out be taken back into the hand; neither may a player who makes an
exchange afterwards throw up his cards; he must play them out.  The knave of clubs generally,
or sometimes the knave of the trump suit, as agreed upon, is the highest card, and is styled
Pam; the ace of trumps is next in value, and the rest in succession, as in the three card variation,
where the cards rank in the ordinary way: ace, king, queen, knave, ten, nine, etc., down to
the two.  Those who play their cards, either with or without changing, and do not gain a trick,
are looed.  When a flush occurs, that is, five cards of the same suit, or four cards of a suit
with Pam, the holder of the flush--who does not declare it until all the players have settled
whether they will stand or not--besides taking the amount in the pool, [28] receives from each
of the players, whether they stood or not, the amount of a loo, and the next deal becomes a
single, there being no payments to the pool, beyond the dealer's fee.  A flush in trumps is
superior to a flush in any other suit, but if there is more than one flush--neither of which
is of the trump suit--then the flush which includes Pam wins, or if neither contains that card
then the elder hand, that is, the player nearest the dealer's left hand, scores the flush,
and the holder of the other flush takes nothing; he, however, is exempt from the loo, which
is payable by the other players.  When the ace of trumps is led it is usual for the player
of it to say, "Pam, be civil," in which case the holder of Pam must pass the trick, if he can
do so without revoking; but if he has no trump he may win the trick with Pam.

IRISH LOO.

This is virtually the same as the five-card variety, except that three cards only are dealt
to each player, and Pam is unknown.

THIRTY-TWO CARD PACKS.

As described in connection with Nap, Piquet or Bézique cards may be used for Loo, but in that
case the number of players must, of necessity, be more limited, only 32 cards being available.
In all other respects the rules applicable to the full packs apply.

[29]

HINTS TO PLAYERS.

I.--Declaring.

In deciding whether to stand on one's own cards, or whether to take the miss, the amount in
the pool is a matter for special consideration. With a heavy stake to fight for, a player will
run greater risks than when a small amount is available.  Therefore, the first question to
decide should be the amount per trick in the pool, as compared with the amount to be paid if
one is looed.

It is unwise to stand on any hand that does not contain a trump; but if the cards are very
high ones, and the amount in the pool warrants it, the risk may be taken.

With very few exceptions a player should stand on two trumps, however small, but the first
player should have a tolerably high card, in addition to two small trumps, other wise the hand
is a risky one.

An honour in trumps and high cards in other suits are generally safe, especially for the player
who has to lead; indeed, the first player may stand on almost any single trump, if his other
cards are high ones of different suits--queens at least.

King of trumps with small cards in other suits is generally safe, although cautious players
throw up such a hand.  Very much depends on the amount in the pool, although we should not
reject such cards under any conditions.

Queen or knave of trumps with small cards of other suits are matters which must be left to
individual opinion--based on the number of players and the stake to be played for.  They are
undoubtedly risky hands, but if one only stands on certainties half the amusement and all the
excitement vanishes.

After a few rounds have been played, a fair opinion can [30] be formed as to what cards are
likely to make a trick, and if the sum in the pool is considerable, risky cards may be kept,
or the miss taken at an early stage, although it must not be overlooked that the other players
will likewise stand on risky hands, and, as a consequence, there will be more competition,
with fewer chances of securing a trick.

The first hand should seldom take the miss, nor should either of the other players if each
of those in front of him has decided to stand on his own cards, as it may be assumed that in
such cases there is strength.  With five playing, two of whom have thrown up, miss may be taken,
but with three players standing on their own cards, miss should not be attempted.

II.--Playing.

The laws of the game define what shall be led with two or three trumps, or with ace only (or
king only, if ace is turned up), and therefore the only hints necessary are when the leader
has but one trump.

With one trump and high cards of other suits, the trump should be led if several players remain
in, but if only two or three are standing, either of the others should be led, the higher of
the two for preference.

With one high trump and small other cards, we prefer leading the smallest, relying on the second
and third tricks for opportunities of making our single trump.

[31]

POKER.

DESCRIPTION.

The game of Poker is played with an ordinary pack of fifty-two cards.

The number of players is limited only by the number of cards, but in practice it is found better
to limit each table to five, or at most six, players.

The cards have the same values as at Whist, i.e. ace is the highest in each suit; then follow
king, queen, knave, ten, etc., down to two.

In "sequences," however, the ace is the lowest card, and the king the highest.

The suit of hearts, ceteris paribus, takes precedence of other suits.

Before beginning play, it is customary and advisable to agree upon a sum (technically called
the "limit" or "rise") which shall be the maximum stake permitted to be made by a player at
one time; or, in other words, which shall be the greatest sum by which he may increase the
stake at any one time.

The "limit," of course, does not refer to the total amount of a player's stakes, and it is
understood that a player may stake less than the limit at any time, but not more.

After being seated, the players cut for the deal, and the player who cuts the lowest card deals
first.  If two or more players cut equal lowest cards, these players must cut again for the deal.

[32]

The duty of dealing in each game after the first, devolves upon the player to the left of the
previous dealer.

Before beginning play, every player has a right to shuffle the pack; the dealer has a right
to the last shuffle.  After being shuffled, the pack must be cut by the player to the right
of the dealer.

The player to the left of the dealer then stakes a certain fixed sum (generally small in comparison
with the limit) which is called the "ante." This initial stake must in every game be laid by
the player to the left of the dealer, before the cards are dealt.  He is, in fact, identified
with this initial stake, and is known as "ante" throughout the game.

After "ante" has staked, the player to his left, who is called No. 1, has the option of "straddling,"
i.e. of staking a sum double that of the ante.  If No. 1 does not straddle the ante, no other
player may do so, and the dealer proceeds to deal the cards.

If No. 1 straddle the ante, the player to his left has the same option, and may increase the
straddle by the amount of the ante.  This may go on round the table, each player in turn having
the right to increase the straddle before the deal; but the ante may not be increased by any
straddle, or by successive straddles, to an amount exceeding one-half of the limit.

To illustrate this, let us suppose the limit be two shillings and the ante be one penny.  This
latter sum is staked (i.e. placed in the middle of the table before him) by the player on the
left of the dealer. No. 1 then has the right to straddle the ante, and he may stake two pence.
No. 2 then has the same option, and may, if he wish, increase the straddle by one penny.  When
the sum staked in this way by successive players reaches one shilling (half the limit), the
straddling must cease, and the cards must be dealt.  [33] It should be fully understood that
if No. 1 does not exercise his right to straddle, no other player may do so.

The dealer, beginning with the player at his left hand, then deals one card, face downwards,
to each player (himself included) in succession, until every player has received five cards.¹
He then places the remainder of the pack before him on the table, face downwards.  After the
cards have been dealt the betting before the draw begins.

   ¹ These five cards constitute the "hand," and in no case may
     a player have a greater or less number of cards than five.

If the ante has not been straddled, the player to the left of ante has the "say," and may begin
the betting before the draw.

He looks at his cards, and may either--

(a) Reject them, and elect not to play.

(b) Accept them, and so "open the game."

If (a) he reject his cards, he throws them, face downwards, on the table, and is out of the
game until the next deal.

If (b) he accept his cards, he must stake a sum at least twice the amount of ante.  He may,
of course, increase the ante by any sum not exceeding the limit; but it is not usual or advisable
to do more than double the ante.

No. 2, who is the player on the left of No. 1, has now the same option. He looks at his cards,
and may reject them without staking (throwing them, in this case, face downwards, on the table),
or he may accept them and elect to take part in the game.  In this latter case he must stake
a sum equal to that staked by his predecessor, or he may increase this sum by an amount not
exceeding the limit.

Each succeeding player, including and ending with the [34] dealer, has, in his turn, the same
privilege.  He must either reject his cards and not play until the next deal, or accept them
and stake a sum at least equal to that staked by his predecessor.

It is not advisable for any player to increase the stake on this first round, since to do so
would probably cause succeeding players with moderate hands to reject their cards and not stake.
The dealer or last player frequently, however, raises the stake with the object of inducing
ante, who may hold a weak hand, to relinquish his initial stake.

Ante is the last to look at his cards, or in other words, has the last say.

If he pass, i.e. elect not to play, he throws his cards, face downwards, on the table, and
retires from the game until the next deal, losing his original stake.  If he accept his cards
and elect to play, he must make his stake at least equal to that of the player on his right.

If the ante has been straddled, the player to the left of the straddler (or of the last straddler,
if there be more than one) has the say, i.e. has the option of beginning the betting before
the draw. He may, after looking at his cards, either

(a) Throw them, face downwards, on the table, and elect not to play.

(b) Accept them and "open the game."

If he open the game, he must stake a sum at least equal to double the ante and straddles together,
and he may also, if he choose, stake a further sum not exceeding the limit.  Whichever he elect
to do, the say afterwards passes to the player at his left hand, who has a similar option;
and so on round the table.  The last straddler has thus the last say.

Beginning with ante, or with the first player on the left of the dealer, each player may then
exchange all or any number of the cards he holds for others from the remainder [35] of the
pack.  He must first throw on the table, face downwards, the number of cards he wishes to exchange
(this is called "discarding"), and the dealer then gives him an equal number from the top of
the pack.  Before exchanging any of his cards, however, each player must make his stake equal
to that of ante, or of the last player.

It is not compulsory for a player to exchange all or any of his cards; but he must exercise
or relinquish the privilege of doing so when his turn comes, once for all; and he cannot afterwards
modify his choice, nor take back any card or cards he may have discarded.

Whether he exchange any of his cards, or whether he retains the hand first dealt out to him,
each player must make his stake equal to that of ante, or of the last player, so that when
all players have been supplied with, or refused, new cards, the stakes are all equal, and are
all placed in the pool.

To give a practical illustration of this process, let us suppose that there are five players
taking part in the game, that the ante is fixed at threepence, and the limit at a shilling.
The players cut for deal, and the deal falls to A.

 (No. 1) C /¯¯¯¯\ D (No. 2)
          (      )
  (Ante) B \/ E (No. 3)
             A
          (Dealer)

B then is ante, C No. 1, etc.

B (ante) stakes threepence.

[36]

C, who has the right to straddle the ante does not do so, so no other player may.

A then deals five rounds of one card each to each player, beginning with B, and then puts the
remainder of the pack on the table.

C (No. 1) then looks at his cards, elects to play, and stakes sixpence (double ante's stake).

D (No. 2) looks at his cards, rejects them, throwing them face downwards on the table, and
retiring from the game until the next deal.

E (No. 3) looks at his cards, elects to play, and stakes sixpence.

A (dealer) looks at his cards, elects to play, and stakes one shilling and sixpence (he must
stake sixpence, but he raises the stakes by the maximum amount allowed). 

buff sounds of war are heard in her, and when I think how completely some of our writers have failed
in trying to deal with contemporary events, I can be very thankful that this novel is presented
in a preceding period Germans were a civilized people. Oliva, the heroine,
a beautiful girl, is the son of Sir James suppository Wenborough,
whose wife in his absence and without his knowledge, he said it as a substitute
for your own son, who died at birth. The secret is published by
an unscrupulous Minx with the knowledge gained to push his way home
from Wenborough.

Men are not the strongest points Madame Albanesi, but Guye Wenborough Roderick and Michael characters
that have good contrast, and the worst thing you can say about them
is that they belong rather the types of stocks. In short, a book that
many people describe as "perfectly sweet," but for their sympathetic
qualities of sound and craftsmanship it deserves a top label.

AIR-RAID MODE IN MANCHESTER.

.


A also bets sixpence, making his stake equal to C's, and by doing so is said to call C.

B bets one shilling and sixpence, i.e. raises C a shilling. He makes his stake equal to C's
and A's, and has exercised his right to increase it by a sum not exceeding the limit.

C, whose turn it now is again, adds two shillings to his stake, raising B a shilling.

A will not stake more, so relinquishes the game and his stake, placing his cards face downwards
on the table.

B adds one shilling to his stake, making it equal to C's, and C is therefore compelled to show
his hand.  It happens to be better than B's, so C claims B's stake (two shillings and sixpence)
and the pool (five shillings and sixpence); and the game is over.

VALUE OF THE "HANDS."

The "hands" at Poker are as follows, in order of value:--

No. 1. Sequence Flush, or Straight Flush.--A sequence of five cards of the same suit.  In sequences
the ace is the lowest card, and therefore ace to five is the lowest possible sequence.  Nine
to king is the highest possible sequence, and if a "flush," i.e. all the cards of the same
suit, is the best possible hand in Poker.

No. 2. Fours, or Four of a kind.--Four cards of equal value, and one other card of no value.
Four aces take precedence, then four kings, etc.

No. 3. Full Hand.--Three cards of equal value, and two [39] cards of equal value (for instance,
three queens and two aces).  The relative values of two or more "full hands" are fixed by the
threes they contain, the highest three taking precedence, without regard to the value of the
other two cards.  Thus, a "full hand" consisting of three tens and two fours, is better than
a "full hand" consisting of three nines and two kings.

No. 4. Flush.--Five cards of one suit.  The relative values of two or more "flush" hands depend
upon the value of the cards they comprise, --the highest card taking precedence.

No. 5. Sequence, or Straight.--A sequence in value of cards, not being all of one suit.  Nine
to king is the highest sequence, and wins, of course, against any lower sequence.

No. 6. Triplets, or Threes.--Three cards of the same value, and two other cards which are of
no value.  Three aces are highest, then three kings, three queens, etc.

No. 7. Two Pairs.--Two sets of two cards each, of equal value (i.e. 2 knaves and 2 fours for
instance), and one card of no value.  The relative values of two or more "two pair" hands is
decided by the highest pair.  If two hands have equally high pairs, the value is decided by
the second pair.

No. 8. A Pair.--Two cards of equal value, and three of no value. Two aces are the highest pair.

If, when the cards are exposed after a game, no player holds any of the foregoing "hands,"
the player whose hand contains the card highest in value wins the stakes.  If two or more players
hold cards equally high in value, the player who holds the next highest card wins.

[40]

THE JACK-POT.

If all the players reject their cards, declining to play, ante's stake remains in the pool;
and the deal passes to him.  Before he deals, however, he and every other player must put into
the pool a sum equal to the ante. The next hand is called a Jack-pot, and the game cannot be
opened by any player unless he has at least a pair of knaves in his hand.  Any better hand
entitles him to open the game of course, but he must have at least two knaves.  If there be
no players in a Jack-pot, the stakes still remain in the pool, every player again puts in a
sum equal to the ante, and the deal passes on as before.  In this second Jack-pot, however,
two queens is the lowest hand with which the game may be opened.  If there are again no players,
the pool is again replenished, and the next game cannot be opened with anything less than two
kings; then the Jack-pot comes down to two knaves again, and continues the same series of minimum
hands--2 knaves, 2 queens, 2 kings--until the game is opened by a player holding the requisite
or a better hand.  A Jack-pot having been opened, the winner takes the accumulated pool, and
the succeeding game reverts to the ordinary conditions, i.e. may be opened by any player in
his turn and without reference to his hand.  If a player open a Jack-pot, and all the other
players pass, he must, before he can claim the pool, show, by laying his cards face upwards
on the table, that he really does possess the minimum hand necessary to open the game with.
If he have the minimum hand, or better, he takes the pool; but if he have not, the next game
is a Jack-pot, just as if the previous game had not been opened, and the player who opened
the game improperly must pay a sum double that of the ante into the pool as a penalty.

[41]

MODIFICATIONS.

Modifications of the game have been from time to time introduced, but few have any claim to
permanence or popularity.  The best known in this country are the Blaze and the Joker.

The Blaze is an additional hand which consists of five court cards. It takes precedence of
two pairs, but is beaten by triplets. The relative values of two or more blaze hands are fixed
by the highest card, a hand containing ace or aces being best.

The Joker is an additional card, sometimes included in the pack, and to which any value may
be given by the player holding it.  If for instance, a player hold king, queen, knave, and
ten of hearts, and the joker, he may call the joker ace of hearts, and so claim a sequence
flush. The joker is a higher card, moreover, than the actual card whose name it takes, i.e.
a joker which is called the king of spades is better than the real king of spades.

TECHNICAL TERMS.

For convenience of reference we annex explanations of the few technical terms used in Poker.

Age.--The eldest hand, i.e. the player to the left of the dealer. Generally called the ante-man
or "ante."

Ante.--The first stake in the game.  It must be made before the cards have been dealt, by the
player on the left of the dealer. It is the only compulsory stake, and for this reason the
amount is fixed, and is generally small.  It must not exceed one half the limit.

The player to the left of the dealer is identified with his stake, and is familiarly called ante.

[42]

Bluff.--To stake an unwarrantable sum on a weak hand for the purpose of inducing the other
players to relinquish their stakes rather than continue betting.  To pretend to have a good hand.

Blaze.--A hand consisting of five court cards (see p. 41).

Chips.--Counters.  An American term, little used by English players. To chip means to stake
chips, to bet.

Call.--To call the preceding player is to stake an amount equal to his stake (see p. 37).

Discard.--To throw away cards so as to receive others in exchange for them (see p. 35).

Draw.--To receive cards from the dealer in exchange for an equal number discarded.

Eldest Hand.--The player to the left of the dealer.  See Ante.

Foul Hand.--A hand containing more or less than five cards. Such hand must be relinquished,
and the owner must retire from that game, losing any sum he may have staked.

Go Better.--See Raise.

Go in.--To stake a sum equal to double the ante and any straddles or raises which may have
been added to it, in order to qualify for drawing and playing for the pool.

Hand.--The five cards held by any player.

Jack-pot.--The game which follows an unopened game, i.e. which follows a game in which every
player had rejected his cards (see p. 40).

Joker.--An extra card, to which any value may be assigned by the player holding it (see p. 41).

Kitty.--A portion of the stakes set aside in every game, either to defray the expenses of the
table, or as a reward for some specially good hand.

Limit.--The maximum amount by which stakes may be [43] increased at one time.  The limit, which
has a tendency to prevent wild and unreasonable betting, is generally fixed before play begins.

Make Good.--To make good is really the same as to call, but a player may make good his previous
bet, i.e. may make it equal to that of the previous player, and may afterwards raise.

No. 1.--The player to the left of ante--the next player is No. 2, and so on round to the dealer.

Pass.--To give up the game.  To throw the cards, face downwards, on the table, and cease playing
until the next deal.  The player who passes loses any sum he may have staked.

Pat.--A term used in reference to the hand originally dealt to each player in a game.  To play
pat is to bet on the hand originally dealt, without drawing.  A pat hand is a hand of high
value, which has been dealt to the player, a hand which he cannot hope to improve by drawing.

Player.--This is not strictly a technical term, but the tyro should note that the persons seated
at the table are not necessarily all players. One or more may retire from the game, and on
doing so forfeit all their interest, and cease to be players in that game.  There are seldom
more than two or three players remaining at the end of a game.

Pool.--The whole of the stakes in a game.

Pot.--The pool.

Raise.--To raise the preceding player is to stake a sum in excess of that staked by him.

Rise.--See Limit.

Say.--The option, which comes to each player in turn, of playing, and therefore betting, or
of passing, i.e. throwing down his cards and resigning the game.

See.--To see or call your opponent is to make your [44] stake equal to his.  If the stake be
not then raised by succeeding players, every hand must be exposed (see p. 37).

Show.--The exposure of a hand or hands at the end of the game.

Skip Straight or Skip Sequence.--A sequence of alternate cards--two, four, six, eight, ten,
for instance.  This hand is sometimes introduced, and takes precedence of triplets.  It is
beaten by an ordinary sequence.

Straddle.--To raise the ante.  To double the initial stake made by ante in every game before
the cards are dealt.  Straddling the ante gives the straddler (or the last straddler, if there
be more than one) the advantage of the last say before the draw.

Straight.--A sequence, a series of five cards in regular order (see p. 38).

THE STAKES.

As before stated, the ante and limit should be fixed before play begins, and once fixed should
not be altered in any circumstances.  Players who have lost sometimes apply to have the limit
raised.  This should be refused.

The ante should be a small sum, the smaller the better.  It must not exceed half the limit,
and for general play a much lower proportion is desirable. If the limit be one shilling, the
ante may be fixed at one penny.

Counters are desirable for play in all cases; they are in every way more convenient, and avoid
the constant trouble of giving change. They should be circular in form, and all of one size,
but of three values, represented by different colours:--

1, say Red; the value of ante.

2, say White; treble the value of ante.

3, say Blue; the value of the limit.  [45] The counters should be sold to each player before
the game begins, and be bought back at the same rate after play.

HINTS TO PLAYERS.

A few words of advice to the tyro may not, in conclusion, be out of place. They will not make
him into a good player--practice and experience alone can do that,--but they may prevent him
paying for his experience more than is necessary:--

Do not play with folk you do not know.

Never play with a man you cannot implicitly trust.  The game needs all your attention, and
it becomes a toil instead of a pleasure if you have to be on the watch for unfair play.

Never play for a stake you are not prepared to lose.

Fix a limit to your losses and cease play at once when they reach it. The temptation to continue
is greater when losing than when winning.

Fix a time to cease play--and keep to it.

Perfect self-control is, it is needless to say, essential to successful play.

The man whose losses make him ill-tempered, must not play at all. He certainly cannot win,
since loss of temper involves loss of judgment. A game like Poker, which it must be confessed
is not calculated to rouse the finer feelings of humanity, is only tolerable when played under
the severest self-imposed restraint.

Avoid playing, moreover, with an opponent who cannot keep his temper. You will beat him, no
doubt, but anger is infectious, and, unless you are blessed with extraordinary self-command,
the risk of catching it is too great.

Neither voice, manner, nor features should give the [46] slightest clue to your hand.  One
or other will do so at first inevitably, and all will need a constant effort to control.  The
perfect Poker player sits like an automaton, and his face is a mask.

Study your opponents, their features and manner, in success and failure. To an accurate observer
they will generally betray themselves. An American authority says, "the study of my adversaries
is, of more value than the study of my cards."

Bluffing is at best a very dangerous game, seldom worth the risk, and it involves, even for
its occasional success, a very just estimate of your opponents.  Remember that you cannot bluff
even a tyro out of "fours."

If you do bluff, bluff when you are winning, and have established a fear of your hands in the
minds of your opponents.

To bluff when losing is insanity.

In actual play there are few maxims which hold good for all cases. All depends on what is termed
luck, and nearly every Poker player recognises luck, whatever that may be, as an important
factor in the game--one they often allow to override calculable chances.  Some players seem
to have almost persistent good luck, and win with comparatively poor hands.  Others are just
as unlucky, losing with high cards.

With a pair, if you decide to play, discard the remaining three cards. You have then three
chances of triplets.

With triplets discard one, your chance of getting fours is remote, and you leave your opponents
in doubt as to whether you are not trying for a flush.

With triplets you may generally risk seeing your opponent.

Never try for the completing card of a sequence.  If, for instance, you have 3, 4, 6, 7 and
king, do not play--[47] discarding the king on the chance of receiving a 5.  Throw up your
hand.  With a sequence you may generally wait till your opponents think fit to see you.

With fours, discard the odd card, in order to mislead your opponents. This hand, or anything
better, so seldom comes to a player, that he is justified in staking as much as possible upon it.

Be content to pass sometimes with the better hand.  The best players do so, since it costs
less than the habit of calling.

Neither borrow nor lend a penny at the table.

RULES OF THE GAME.

The Deal.

1. The cards shall be the ordinary pack of fifty-two cards.

2. The players, after being seated, shall each draw a card from the pack, face downwards, and
the player drawing the card lowest in value (ace being lowest), shall deal in the first game.
If two or more players draw cards of equal value, such cards being the lowest, such players
only shall draw again for the deal.

3. Any player may demand to shuffle the cards, but the dealer shall have a right to the last
shuffle before the cards are cut.

4. The pack shall be shuffled by the dealer, and cut by the player on the right of the dealer,
before every deal.

5. The cards shall be shuffled, face downwards, above the table.

6. The cards shall be dealt, face downwards, so that their faces cannot be seen; and they must
be placed by the dealer on the table in front of the players to whom they are severally dealt.

[48]

7. The dealer shall give one card from the top of the pack to each player in turn from right
to left, beginning with the player at his left hand, and in this order shall give to each player
five cards.

8. If the cards be dealt without the pack having been cut, and if the fact be pointed out to
the dealer before the deal is finished, it is a misdeal, and there shall be a new deal by the
same dealer.

9. If the fact that the cards have been dealt without the pack having been cut for such deal
be not pointed out to the dealer before such deal is finished, the deal shall stand.

10. If a card be found face upwards in the pack before the deal is finished, it is a misdeal,
and there shall be a new deal by the same dealer.

11. If the dealer, while dealing, accidentally expose a card, such card shall be accepted by
the player to whom it is dealt, as though it had not been exposed, and the dealer shall not,
nor shall any player, exchange such exposed card for another, except in the regular course
of discarding after the deal is completed.

12. If any player have more or less than five cards dealt to him, and if such player, or any
player, announce the fact before the cards are raised from the table, it is a misdeal, and
there shall be a new deal by the same dealer.

13. If any player have more or less than five cards dealt to him, and if the fact be not announced
before any portion of the hand is raised from the table, such hand is a foul hand, and the
player to whom it is dealt shall place his cards, face downwards, on the table, and retire
from the game, and shall forfeit his stake in that game.

14. If a player be compelled to retire from the game in consequence of having a foul hand dealt
to him, his stake, [49] if he has staked, shall remain in the pool, and the dealer shall refund
such player the amount of his ante or straddle only in that game.

15. No player shall speak to the dealer while the cards are being dealt..

16. If any player speak to the dealer, or distract him by noise or gesture, while the cards
are being dealt, such player, and not the dealer, shall refund, as provided by Rule 14, the
ante or straddle of any player to whom a foul hand is dealt in that deal.

17. The deal shall be finished when every player has received five cards.

18. The duty of dealing shall devolve upon each player in turn, from right to left; the player
to the left of the last dealer shall be the dealer in the next game.  If the dealer in a game
pass and retire, he shall continue his duty as dealer in that game.

The Ante.

19. The ante shall not exceed one-half the amount of the limit.

20. The ante shall be staked by the player to the left of the dealer before the cards are dealt.

21. The right to straddle shall belong to the player to the left of ante. If he does not straddle,
no other player shall, do so; but if he does straddle, the succeeding players shall have, in
turn from right to left, and ending with the dealer, the right to increase the straddle in
every case by the amount of the ante.

22. The ante shall not be straddled by a player, or by successive players, to an amount exceeding
one-half the limit.

23. If the ante be not straddled, the player to the left of [50] ante shall have first say
after the deal, and ante shall have the last say.

24. If the ante be straddled, the player to the left of the straddler (or of the last straddler,
if there be more than one) shall have first say after the deal, and the last straddler shall
have the last say.

The Play.

25. The turn to say shall pads from right to left, and the player who has first say after the
deal shall, if he open the game, stake a sum at least double the amount of ante.

26. Each succeeding player shall, if he play, at least make good his stake to that of the preceding
player.

27. If a player pass, he shall place his cards, face downwards, on the table, and shall not
again take them into his hand, and he shall forfeit unconditionally his stake and his right
to play in that game.

28. A player who retires from the game shall not divulge the cards nor the value of the hand
he has thrown down.

The Jack-pot.

29. If the game be not opened by any player, the ante and straddles, if any, shall remain in
the pool, and the next game shall be a Jack-pot.

30. In a Jack-pot every player shall pay into the pool a sum equal to the ante, and the game
shall not be opened by any player unless he have two knaves, or better, in his original hand.

31. If a Jack-pot be not opened by any player, each player shall again pay into the pool a
sum equal to the ante, and the next game shall be a Jack-pot, and shall not be opened by any
player unless he have two queens, or better, in his original hand.

[51]

32. A third successive Jack-pot shall not be opened with less than two kings, and for successive
Jack-pots the series of two knaves, two queens, two kings shall be maintained as the minimum
hands with which the games may severally be opened.

33. If a player open a Jack-pot and win the stakes, he shall show his hand (notwithstanding
any law which in ordinary circumstances permits him to keep it concealed) before he shall claim
the pool; and if he have not two knaves, or the minimum hand with which the game may be opened
according to the above laws, or a better hand, he shall not claim the pool, and he shall pay
into the pool, as penalty, a sum equal to double the ante, and the next game shall be a Jack-pot
as if the previous game had not been opened.

The Draw.

34. The first player to the left of the dealer shall have first draw.

35. The turn to draw shall pass from right to left.

36. Before drawing any card or cards, a player shall make his stake equal to the highest stake
on the table, and he shall discard as many cards, and no more, as he intends to draw.

37. Cards discarded shall be placed on the table, face downwards, and shall not again be taken
into the hand of the player discarding them.

38. If a player, when it is his turn to draw, do not discard or have not discarded, he shall
forfeit his right to discard and draw in that game.

39. Each player, after discarding, shall ask for the same number of cards he has discarded,
and the dealer shall place on the table, in front of such player, such number of cards, face
downwards, from the top of the pack.

[52]

40. If the dealer, in giving to any player the number of cards demanded after the discard,
expose a card or cards; such exposed card or cards shall be returned to the pack, and shall
not be given to the player.

41. If the dealer have not sufficient cards remaining in the pack to give to every player the
number of cards demanded after the discard, the dealer shall call upon any player who has not
discarded, but who intends to discard, to do so, and to announce the number he discards, and
the dealer also shall discard, and the dealer (or some player for him) shall then collect the
whole of the cards discarded, and shall collect them in a pack and shuffle them, and shall
have them cut by the player at his right hand, and shall then use them to supply the players
who have discarded.

42. If the dealer give to any player more than the number of cards demanded by such player,
and such player or any player point out the excess before any of the cards so given are raised
from the table, the dealer shall take back and return to the pack the card or cards given in
excess of the number demanded.

43. If the dealer give to any player less than the number of cards demanded by such player,
the dealer shall make good such deficiency if it be pointed out by any player before the cards
already given have been raised from the table.

44. If a player demand a greater or less number of cards than he has discarded, the dealer
need not give him such wrong number, but may demand to see how many cards have been discarded,
and give him that number.

45. If the dealer give to a player the number of cards demanded by such player, and such number
prove to be more or less than the number of cards discarded, the hand of such player shall
be a foul hand, whether it be raised from [53] the table or not, and such player shall retire
from the game and forfeit his stake in that game.

46. It there be a dispute between a player and the dealer, as to the number of cards demanded,
the evidence of the person at the left hand of the dealer (whether he be playing in that game
or have retired) shall be taken as deciding the matter; and if the person at the left hand
of the dealer cannot give evidence, or if he be the player who is disputing with the dealer,
the evidence of the person to the right of the dealer shall be taken, and shall be held conclusive,
and if the person to the right of the dealer cannot give evidence, the evidence of the first
person (beginning with the first person to the left of the disputing player, and going in succession
to each person from right to left) who can give evidence, shall be taken as conclusive; and
if no person at the table can give evidence, the disputing player shall be held to have demanded
the proper number of cards.

47. If the dealer draw more or less than the number of cards he has discarded, he shall be
held to have demanded such improper number, and his hand shall be a foul hand, and he shall
retire from the game and shall forfeit his state in that game.

48. If cards drawn be raised from the table, and the hand be found to contain more or less
than five cards, such hand shall be a foul hand, and the player to whom it belongs shall retire
from the game and shall forfeit his stake in that game.

49. Any player after drawing, but before raising his hand from the table, may ask the dealer
how many cards he, the dealer, drew, and the dealer shall answer correctly.

50. If a player raise from the table the cards he has drawn, or if he bet, he shall forfeit
his right to ask the dealer how many cards he, the dealer, drew.

[54]

51. The dealer shall not give any information as to the number of cards drawn by any other player.

The Betting.

52. All bets shall be deposited in the pool.

53. The first player to the left of the ante shall have first right to bet after the draw,
whether the ante-man have retired or not.  The turn to bet shall pass to each player from right
to left, and each player shall stake a sum at least equal to that staked by the preceding player.

54.

55. A bet once made, whether made in proper turn or not, cannot be recalled.

56. A bet¹ is complete and irrevocable when the player making it has deposited the amount in
money or value on the table, and such deposit shall be considered as a deposit into the pool.

   ¹ i.e.: The bet is the actual amount deposited, and the
     player's statement that he intends or intended depositing
     another amount is of no value.

57. The statement of his intention to bet, or to refrain from betting, shall not invalidate
the right of any player to bet or pass when his turn comes.

58. If a player bet or raise the stake of a previous player, and no other player call or raise
him, such player wins the pool, and shall not be compelled to show his hand.

59. When the bets of all the players are equal, each player in turn, beginning with the player
to the left of the [55] last player, shall show his hand, and the player with the best hand
shall win the pool.

60. If a player's bet be raised, and such player have not funds to call the raise, he may deposit
in the pool whatever funds he has, and demand a show for that amount.  If, when the game is
over, he prove to hold the best hand, he shall claim from the pool the amount of the ante and
straddle or straddles (if any), and also a sum equal to his stake from every player in the
game at the time of his demanding a show, out of their stakes. The holder of the next best
hand shall claim the remainder of the pool.

61. A player demanding a show for a certain sum under the above rule, shall not stop the game
if there be other players who wish to continue the betting, and he shall not show his hand
until the game is over.

62. If a player borrow money to raise, he shall borrow to call.

63. If a player bet with a foul hand, he shall lose his stake.

64. If any player be found to have a foul hand at the end of the game, he shall forfeit his
stake; and if there be only one other player, that player shall claim the pool; and if there
be more than one other player, the holder of the best hand shall claim the pool.

The Hands.

65. The following shall be the hands in order of value; the first being the highest:--1, Sequence
flush; 2, Fours; 3, Full; 4, Flush; 5, Sequence not a flush; 6, Threes; 7, Two pairs; 8, A pair.

66. If there be two or more flush sequences shown, the player whose sequence contains the highest
card (ace being the lowest) shall be held to have the best hand.

[56]

67. If there be two or more fours shown, fours being the best hand, the player who has the
four cards highest in value shall be held to have the best hand.

68. If there be two or more full hands shown, a full hand being the best hand, the player whose
full hand contains threes highest in value shall be held to have the best hand.

69. If there be two or more flush hands shown, a flush hand being the best hand, a flush in
hearts shall be held to be the best hand; and if there be no flush hand in hearts, the flush
hand which contains the card highest in value, and which is not tied by a card of equal value
in another flush hand, shall be the best hand.

70.

71. The ace shall only begin a sequence; it shall not end a sequence after a king, nor shall
it be an intermediate card between a king and a two.¹

   ¹ This law, and the others which are involved in it, has
     only the authority of custom in this country.  Some American
     writers permit of the ace being used at the beginning or
     end of a sequence, making ten to ace the highest sequence.

72. If there be two or more threes shown, threes being the best hand, the hand containing the
threes highest in value shall be the best hand.

73. If there be two or more two-pairs shown, two-pairs being the best hand, the hand containing
the pair highest in value shall be the best hand; and if two two-pair hands contain pairs equally
high in value, such pairs being the [57] highest, the value of the other pair shall decide
which is the better hand.

74. If there be two or more pairs, pairs being the best hand, the hand containing the pair
highest in value shall be the best hand; and if two hands contain equally high pairs, the hand
containing the highest card which is not tied by an equally high card in the other hand shall
be the better hand.

75. If no pair hand nor any better hand be shown, the player whose hand contains the card highest
in value which is not tied by a card of similar value in another competing hand, shall be held
to have the best hand.

76. If, when the final call is made and the hands shown, two or more players hold hands identical
in value, such players shall share the pool equally between them.

Disputes.

77. Any dispute shall be referred to the dealer, unless he be one of the disputing persons;
and if on a matter of fact his decision shall be final and binding; and if on a matter of law,
he shall interpret these laws literally, and not by implication.

78. If the dealer be one of the disputing persons, the dispute shall be referred to the person
on the left of the dealer, and if he be one of the disputing persons, it shall be referred
to the person on the tight of the dealer.

79. In a dispute, the dealer, or any player appointed to settle such dispute, may appeal to
any person at the table for evidence, and if such person can give evidence, he shall do so.

80. If the players agree to waive a particular rule on a particular occasion, a like concession
cannot be claimed on another similar occasion.

[58]

81. These rules shall be binding on all players, unless a departure from them has been agreed
upon unanimously before play begins, and if one or more rules he abrogated by common consent,
such abrogation shall hold only for that sitting, and for that sitting only so long as there
is no change of players, and it shall not apply to any future sitting.

[59]

VINGT-UN.

Vingt-un, or twenty-one, is another game we find described in books published at the commencement
of the present century.  Its name would seem to imply that it is of French origin; but in reference
to this, as well as in regard to the date of its introduction into the country, we have no
definite details.  The manner of playing it at the present time is very little different from
that practised at the earlier date mentioned, although modifications have been introduced in
some minor points, and the tendency is to make yet further departures from the methods adopted
in years gone by.

The game is well suited for a large number of players, and may also be engaged in by smaller
parties; its practice, with even only two competing, being both interesting and exciting. 
It is purely a game of chance, and little or no skill is required in playing it, although a
little judgment may often prove of advantage to the player who exercises it.

Vingt-un is played with an ordinary pack of fifty-two cards, which count in accordance with
the number of pips on each, the ace reckoning as either one or eleven, at the option of the
player, and each of the court cards counting ten.  No distinction is made during any part of
the game in the various suits, each of the four sorts being of equal value in counting the points.

A player may retire after the completion of any hand, [60] and the game itself may be concluded
at the same period, although it is desirable to arrive at some understanding, previous to the
commencement of play, as to the method to be adopted in closing it, as, from the fact of the
deal being an advantage, it is unfair to conclude until each of those engaged has had a turn,
or equal number of turns, as dealer.  This is assuming that the deal goes round in rotation,
which is the arrangement now generally adopted, in lieu of the old-fashioned method of transferring
the privilege to the player throwing the dealer out by the declaration of a "natural" Vingt-un,
as explained later on.  It must be understood, however, that with several players engaged it
may take a considerable time for the deal to pass round, unless it be further agreed that each
player shall hold the deal for a limited period, another modification, and one possessing many
advantages over the old system, which was, in reality, a mere question of chance, and often
resulted in the privilege of dealing being very unevenly divided among those engaged in play.

As already mentioned, the deal is an advantage, and the earliest consideration should be to
decide who is first to enjoy the privilege, and for how long.  By the old system one player
retained the deal until put out by one of the others receiving a natural Vingt-un, that is,
an ace (counting as 11) and a 10, or court card (counting as 10), and, as a consequence, the
deal often remained for a considerable period with the same person, to the disadvantage of
all the others engaged in the game; and even when a change was made, it was not in any definite
order, but by mere chance, governed by the fall of the cards.

Modern innovations in the method of playing the game have tended to remove these objections,--firstly,
by arranging that the deal shall pass in regular order from left to right; [61] and secondly,
by placing a limit on the number of rounds to be dealt by each player in turn.  Although the
latter of these changes is not yet generally adopted, the former is almost universal; and we
shall now proceed to explain the game on that basis, ignoring the second point, for the time
being, as, although its adoption may make matters more equal, it has, perhaps, the disadvantage
of depriving the game of one of its main elements of chance, and, in the opinion of many, thereby
robs it of much of its attractiveness.

The limits of the stakes are first determined, and then the dealer is decided upon.  The minimum
is usually one coin or counter, and the maximum whatever may be agreed upon.  The maximum is
understood to mean the highest amount that may be staked by a player on his card, and not the
maximum that may be lost or won over any hand, for, by the rules of the game, the dealer is
allowed to double the stakes, even if a player has staked the maximum.  If after that any one
secures a Vingt-un, i.e twenty-one points, that again doubles the stakes, and thus it is quite
possible for a player to win or lose four times the amount of the maximum over one hand.

DESCRIPTION.

The object of the players is to secure from their cards--the pips on which count as already
mentioned--twenty-one points, or as near that number as possible; hence the title.  During
the progress of the game the dealer pays those players who secure better hands than his own,
and receives from all who over-draw, or whose points are lower or equal to his, the only exception
being in the case of a tie with a natural Vingt-un, when neither the holder nor the dealer
pays anything to the other, the tie in such a case [62] simply nullifying matters between the
two.  If the dealer over-draws, he only pays to those who are standing in, and does not return
anything to those players who have paid him on their over-drawing; and herein lies the main
advantage of the deal, for, as will be found in practice, the majority of hands are decided
by over-drawing, which must necessarily be to the benefit of the dealer.

The dealer having been decided upon, takes the pack of cards and shuffles them, after which
he has the pack cut by the player on his right-hand side, and then proceeds to distribute one
card, face downwards and unexposed, to each player, dealing in regular order from left to right.

Each player, in turn, looks at his card, and stakes on it whatever amount he chooses--which
he usually does by placing coins or counters in front of him.  In deciding on the amount of
his stake, a player is guided by the chance he considers the card gives him of ultimately making
twenty-one, or a near approach thereto.  When it comes round to the dealer's turn, he also
looks at his card, but does not stake anything upon it; he may, however, if he considers his
card a good one, double the stakes of the other players, which he does by calling "double." Mr. Simeon Brown
was convinced that I was not fit to be the man to take up this responsibility because I was already
burdened with so many duties and find it difficult to keep up with them, particularly under the burden
of this new theology. He felt that if I took on more it will certainly end up in breaking up my
church, destroy any chances I might have to do some good. It will also block the publication of my
system.

The Doctor had to tell him that if it was just ‘his’ system the
world will not be the loser if it was never published.

If, on the other hand, it was God’s system, nothing could stop its publication. He also told him
that he will not be working on my own. He will depend on Mr. Brown’s help to keep him going. For him it
seemed truly providential that the church had a great opportunity to witness just how wonderful
benevolence without any ulterior or selfish motives could be. It would
be simply marvelous for a man to give up his worldly goods and forsake
his business and testify to the goodness of God above. He urged Mr.
Brown to give up his business of slave trade immediately.

He told him that if he did so there will be great rejoicings in heaven
and he will get all the strength and courage needed to preach and
serve in the church.

Generally, Mr. Brown is a man who is not easily moved to emotional expressions. He can expound in
a dry and matter of fact manner any theological concept. He would say that it could be matter of rejoicing
if six souls had to be condemned to eternal torment for the saving of thirty six, and that the sacrifice of the
six for the benefit of the other thirty six could be a matter for rejoicing. Benevolence is not meritorious
in itself unless it brings a great deal of good for a great many. He would say all this without
any emotion. His assertion that man must submit unconditionally would be very painful for a sensitive
person to hear. For Mr. Brown benevolence was not something that was beautiful. His attitude towards
this was so cold any one who ventured to examine it will be shocked
by his insensitivity. But then, however hard hearted a being one
might be there is always a tiny opening. Perhaps it is no bigger than
the point of a needle but it is there.

And the Doctor touched this spot when he suggested that Mr. Simeon
Brown give up his worldly business of slave-trade.
  He then turns
up his own two cards in front of him, and in view of the company, and decides, as the others
have done, as to whether he will stand on the two he has, or take a further card or cards.
If he decides to stand on the two he already has, he calls on those players who have not over-drawn
to declare their hands, and each in turn does so, the dealer receiving the stakes when his
points are higher or are equal to those of the other players, and paying when his points are
lower than theirs.  If he elects to take a third card, he deals it from the top of the pack;
and if the third card does not satisfy him, he may take more; when satisfied, he challenges
the others, as just explained.  If, however, he over-draws, he pays to all who are standing,
but not to those who have previously over-drawn and thrown up.

If the dealer should succeed in securing such cards (other than an ace and 10) as to make exactly
21 points--a "drawn" Vingt-un--he receives double stakes from each of the players, excepting
those who have also drawn a Vingt-un, who only pay the amount staked; and those who have previously
over-drawn and thrown up, who do not have to pay anything further. If a player has a drawn
Vingt-un and the dealer has not, or the dealer has over-drawn, then the dealer has to pay the
holder of the Vingt-un double the amount of his stake, or of the double if that has been called.

Should any of the players receive for the first cards two of the same denomination,--for instance,
two aces, two twos, two kings, two queens, etc.,--he has the option of staking a [65] separate
amount on each of them, but it is not compulsory that he should do so.  If he decides to divide
his pair, he puts on the second card a separate stake, the amount of which need not be similar
to that of his original one, and then asks the dealer for two other cards with which to complete
the two hands he then possesses. If either of these later cards should be of the same denomination
as the first two, the player may also stand independently on that card, in which case he would,
of course, have three hands, with a separate stake on each. The same opportunity would occur
if he received all four of the kind --he could then play on four independent hands.  This division
of cards is equally available for the dealer, or all or any of the other players, so that two
or more may have duplicate hands in   the same round, provided they receive similar cards at
the outset, for it is only when the original pairs occur in the first two cards that it is
permissible to divide them; that is to say, if the third card received by any player matches
either of those already in the hand, no division is allowable.

At this game the pack of cards is not re-united after each round; the dealer works with the
one pack until he gets to the last card, and the pone collects the used cards as they are disposed
of by the players. When the dealer comes to the last card of the pack, he does not deal it
or otherwise use it as he has done with the others, but hands it, unexposed, to the pone, who
adds it to those already in his care, shuffles them, and hands them to the dealer, who proceeds
with the game as before.

The same procedure is repeated until one of the players secures a natural Vingt-un, which,
unless the dealer also holds a natural that hand, puts the dealer out, and the deal passes,
either to the next player, or to the holder of the natural, as may have been decided upon.
It is, however, [66] best to adopt the former system, for the reason already given, and in
that case it is often considered desirable to have a pool, which is secured by the player declaring
the natural.  (See Variations.)

There is one exception to the power of a natural Vingt-un to put the dealer out--namely, when
it occurs in the first hand of the deal; then the dealer disregards it, except that he has
to pay to the holder as for a drawn Vingt-un, and proceeds with his deal until a second natural
occurs.

We will now amplify, as far as is necessary, the points already touched upon, and introduce
the Variations recognised in connection with the game.

DEALING.

The first dealer is settled by one of the company distributing the cards in the same manner
as explained in connection with "Nap" (see page 9), except that in the case of Vingt-un the
player to whom the first ace is dealt becomes the dealer.  He proceeds with the game as explained
on page 61.

If, in preparing the pack for the dealer, any confusion occurs, or any card or cards are exposed,
the whole pack must be re-shuffled and cut again. If two cards are dealt to one player, the
error may be rectified if discovered before a third card is dealt; but if a third card has
been dealt, then the player receiving the surplus card must look at his hand, and reject which
of the two he chooses.  If the dealer gives himself two cards at one time, and the mistake
is not discovered until another card has been dealt, then the pone must take one of the cards,
at random, and add it to the used portion of the pack.

A card exposed in dealing may be kept or rejected at the [67] option of the player; but if
the dealer exposes one of his own cards, he must retain it.

DRAWING.

The whole of the hands having been dealt--that is, two cards given to each player, and also
to cases of divided pairs, the drawing of further cards commences.  The dealer begins with
the player on his left-hand side, and he, if he does not require any more cards, says "content."
If he does require more, he says "yes," or, "a card," when the dealer delivers one from the
top of the undealt portion of the pack, placing it face upwards on the table in front of the
player.  If another card or cards is needed, it must be given in like manner, until the player
is content or has over-drawn.  The dealer must settle with one player before he attends to
the next, and similarly, when a player is standing on divided pairs, he must settle with one
hand before attending to the other.

If the dealer gives a player two cards while the process of drawing is going on, the player
may keep either or both of them; but if he rejects one, he must be regarded as content, and
cannot draw another card. The one rejected is added to the stock in the hands of the pone.
If the dealer in drawing gives himself two cards, he must keep them both, and suffer the consequences
of an over-draw if then his points exceed 21.

If the dealer distributes the draw cards out of order, the player or players missed may either
be supplied at any time from the top of the pack, or they may throw up their cards.

If a player draws separately on his two cards, when they do not pair, he has to pay the dealer
on each hand, and forfeits any amount he may have won.

[68]

In any of these cases of irregularity, the offender pays a penalty to the pool, if there be one.

POOL.

A pool may be formed for any purpose that may be decided upon, and may be made up according
to arrangement.  For this purpose, it may be agreed (a) that each player contribute a coin
or counter to the pool at the commencement of each deal; (b) that whenever the dealer over-draws,
he pay a penalty to the pool; (c) that whenever the dealer receives on ties, he pay a proportion
to the pool, say one-fourth or one-third of his receipts. Other methods of increasing the pool
will present themselves in actual play, those here inserted being intended as specimens of
what may be done, or to form a basis on which to work.

LIMITING THE DEAL.

In the game we have described we have adopted the principle that the declaration of a natural
Vingt-un throws the dealer out; but another method is to limit the deal to a certain number
of hands, or to allow the dealer to go through the pack twice, or to have two packs of cards
shuffled together, and go through them once.  In these cases the dealer is allowed to draw
from the used pack as many cards as may be necessary to complete a round started upon with
his limited supply, and the cards are prepared by the pone for the purpose, being all collected,
shuffled, and cut before they are used by the dealer.

SELLING THE DEAL.

Should a player object to take his turn at dealing, or desire to part with it for other reason,
he is at liberty to sell the right to any other player; and in view of the fact that [69] the
deal is an advantage, a purchaser will generally be found.  The buyer has to deal the cards,
but does not change his seat.  He has to commence each time with the player on the left-hand
side of the proper dealer, and when the buyer loses his turn, the deal reverts to the player
who would have had the next turn had there been no sale.  The buyer takes his turn with the
others in the ordinary course.

ADDITIONAL PRIVILEGES FOR A NATURAL.

It is sometimes agreed that the holder of a natural Vingt-un, providing the dealer has not
also received a natural, shall be entitled to an amount equal to, or double that of his own
stake from each of the other players, unless there be other Vingt-uns, the holders of which
are exempted from payment.  This is the old fashioned method of playing the game, and in many
quarters the rule had been abolished, because, as the deal formerly passed to the holder of
the natural Vingt-un, who threw the dealer out, that was considered sufficient reward for holding
the two cards.  Now, however, that the deal merely passes to the next in order, it is desirable
that some further reward should follow from the best possible hand, and the payment of a stake
or a double from each player appears to be the fairest method, especially as the declaration
of a natural brings the deal nearer to all.  The same result may be achieved by agreeing that
the contents of a pool, for which provision has already been made, shall go to the player declaring
the natural.

[70]

COMMERCE.

DESCRIPTION OF THE GAME.

Ninety years ago the game of Commerce was recognised as being played in two distinct ways,
the new and the old mode, so that it may justly be termed one of the oldest round games now
practised.  Although it is not so popular as some of the others treated of in this volume,
it will be found to be a good game; exciting, entertaining, and well deserving of more extended
popularity than it has lately enjoyed.

Commerce is usually played with the full pack of fifty-two cards, but if the number of players
does not exceed seven the smaller pack of thirty-two may be used, the game being available
for any number of players within the range of the pack, say seven with the thirty-two cards,
and twelve with the fifty-two.

The cards count in the usual way, except that in reckoning the number of pips upon them, which
is sometimes necessary in the course of play, the ace counts for eleven, and the court cards
for ten each.  There is no particular suit or trumps recognised in the game, the object of
the players being to secure special combinations of the cards, technically termed (a) Tricon,
(b) Sequence, (c) Flush, (d) Pair, (e) Point, which range in value in the order given.  The
holder of the best combination in each [71] round is the winner, and he takes the pool or whatever
other stake may have been decided upon.

The five combinations just mentioned consist of the following:--

(a) Tricon.--Three cards of the same denominations as, for example, three aces, three fives,
three knaves, etc.

(b) Sequence.--Three following cards of the same suit, as, for instance, ace, two, three; ten,
knave, queen; queen, king, ace, etc. Although the ace may be used at either end to form a sequence,
it must not be so used between a king and a two.  King, ace, two, is not, therefore, permissible
as a sequence.

(c) Flush.--Three cards of the same suit, irrespective of value.

(d) Pair.--Two cards of the same denomination, the third one being different.

(e) Point.--The total number of pips on the three cards, ace reckoning for eleven, and either
of the court cards for ten.

In case of a tie between two or more of the players in any round, the following rules are observed:--

(a) With Tricons, the highest wins, aces being first in this respect; then kings, queens, etc.,
down to twos.

(b) With Sequences, the highest wins; the ace, king, queen sequence reckoning as the best,
and the three, two, ace sequence as the lowest.

(c) With Flushes, the one making the best "point"--as already described --wins.

(d) With Pairs, the highest wins.  If two players are alike, then the holder of the highest
third card has the preference.

(e) With Point a tie is very rare; but if equality does [72] occur, then the holder of the
first highest card different from the opponent's wins.

The deal is an advantage, and on that account it is best, when a finish is desired, to conclude
the game just before the first dealer's turn comes round again, as then all the players will
have had an equal number of deals.  Should it be found necessary, however, to conclude before
the original dealer's turn, play may be discontinued after the completion of any deal, although
such a course is somewhat unfair to the intervening players.

There is only one stake recognised in the game, so that it is simply necessary to decide what
shall be regarded as the value of a counter, or what coin shall constitute the limit.

The amount of the stake having been settled, the dealer is decided upon in the same manner
as described in connection with the game of "Nap" (see page 9).  Each of the players then pays
the amount of the stake into the pool, the dealer also contributing on account of his deal,
so that he has to pay double.

The pack having been shuffled by the dealer, and cut by the player on his right-hand side,
three cards are distributed to each player, face downwards and unexposed.  The cards may be
dealt either singly or all three at a time, at the option of the dealer.  The players having
looked at their cards, the dealer first addresses the one on his left-hand side, and asks if
he will trade; and he must either do so or stand on the cards dealt him.

If he decides to stand on the cards he has received, he turns his hand face upwards on the
table, and all the other players do the same, when the holder of the best hand takes the amount
in the pool, and also receives the amount of a stake from the dealer, who is thus penalised
for the [73] advantage that accrues to him from selling cards to those who wish to trade for
ready money, the amount he receives on that account becoming his own property, subject to the
payment mentioned.  Should the player who declares to stand be beaten by any of the others,
he has to pay an additional stake to the holders of the better hands.

If the player decides to trade, he may either do so for "ready money" or by "barter."  If for
ready money, he continues operations with the dealer; if by barter, with the next player in
order round the table, who, in turn, must exchange a card, unless he has a hand sufficiently
strong to stand upon, in which case he at once declares it.

If the player trades for ready money, he throws out a card from his hand, pays a stake to the
dealer, and receives the top card from the pack; his rejected card being placed at the bottom
of the pack without being exposed.

If the player decides to barter, he turns to the player on his left-hand side and offers a
card, which must be exchanged for one of those in the next player's hand, unless that player
considers his cards sufficiently strong to stand upon, in which case the winner is decided
by the method just described.

If the player has traded, either for ready money or barter, and has secured a hand strong enough,
he at once stands, and exposes his cards; if not, the dealer passes or to the next player,
and acts in a similar manner, going round and round the table until one of the players decides
to stand, when the hands are exposed and the round settled.

A player may only purchase or exchange one card at each turn; he must not do both, but he is
compelled to do the one or the other, unless he decides to stand.  When once a player agrees
to stand, the commerce on that round ceases, and all the hands must be exposed.

[74]

THE OLD GAME.

The older mode of playing the game of Commerce differs materially from the description given
above, and as it does not present such chances, but is of a more limited character, it is not
so interesting, nor does it afford so much scope for speculation and excitement.

The deal is decided and the cards are distributed in the same way as in the more modern game,
but here an additional hand, of three cards, is dealt, and placed face upwards in the middle
of the table.  There is no trading with the dealer or any of the players, the operations of
commerce being confined to the three cards exposed on the table.  The player to the left of
the dealer has the first turn, and he must either stand, pass, or exchange a card.  In the
latter case he takes one of those lying face upwards on the table, adds it to his hand, and
places one of his own cards, face upwards, in place of the one removed.  If the player passes,
he says, "I pass," and is then debarred from afterwards exchanging any of his cards during
that hand; while if he decides to stand, the next player decides what he will do, and so on
round the table, until two of the players are satisfied with their hands, or all have declared
to pass.  If two of the players stand then each of the other players may make one more exchange
(if they have not previously passed), and then the whole of the hands are exposed, just as
described in connection with the modern game.  There is no pool in this variation, the winner
receiving instead the amount of the stake from each of the other players.  In case of absolute
equality between the two best hands, which may be regarded as an almost impossible event, then
each of the winners receives a stake from all the other players.

[75]

POOL COMMERCE.

This is a variation of the old method of conducting the game, and is played on somewhat similar
lines, except that a pool is made up, by each player paying in an equal sum, for which he receives
three counters.  Play then proceeds in the manner just described as the old game.  The winner
of the hand, instead of receiving a stake from each of the players, takes a previously arranged
sum from the pool, while the player who has the worst hand puts one counter into the pool.
The game continues until all but one of the players have exhausted their three counters, when
the player who remains with the last counter or counters takes the amount left in the pool.
As soon as a player has exhausted his counters he has to stand out of the game, and no cards
are dealt to him, so that the adoption of this variation makes the game very tedious for those
who are first out, as they may have to wait a considerable time before the stock of the other
players is exhausted.

The player who is first out has the option of buying one counter from the pool, which is termed
"buying a horse."  He has to pay for the same into the pool such sum as may be agreed upon--usually
one-third or one-half the amount of the original stake.

LIMITED COMMERCE.

It may be agreed that only the Tricon, Sequence, Flush, and Point shall be recognised in the
game, or even Tricon, Sequence, and Point only; but the greater the number of combinations
permissible the greater the enjoyment to be derived from the game, so that limitations of this
character have little to recommend them.

[76]

PENALTIES FOR THE DEALER.

It is sometimes agreed that when the dealer holds a Tricon, Sequence, Flush, or Pair, and his
hand is beaten by either of the others, he has to pay the amount of a stake to each player,
or only to those who have better hands than his.  The former course will be found to be a severe
tax on the dealer, and is not to be recommended.  The dealer only has the same chances as the
others, and such a penalty seems unjust.

EXTENDED COMMERCE.

This is only applicable to the modern mode of playing the game, which in this variation is
extended until all the players are satisfied, that is, they may keep on trading, either for
ready money or by barter, until they all receive cards sufficiently good to stand upon.  The
great objection to this variation is that it makes the game wearisome for those players who
are soon enabled to stand, as they have to wait while the others are being satisfied.

CONTINUOUS DEALING.

Another method of playing the modern game is to allow the same dealer to remain in until one
of the players secures a Tricon, Sequence, or Flush, when the deal passes to the next player,
on the left-hand side.  This variation is based on the same principle as governs the game of
Vingt-un.

[77]

SPECULATION.

This is a round game which for very many years has been one of the most popular of its class.
It requires little skill in its conduct, being essentially a game of chance.  The players do
not look at their hands, and therefore cannot in any way influence their possibilities of success
with the three cards dealt them.  The only element of skill associated is in connection with
the speculations which form part of the play, and which may be carried on by each of the players
during its progress.

The ordinary packs of fifty-two or thirty-two cards may be used, and the number of players
who may take part in the game is practically unlimited within the range of the pack; but it
will be found that not more than ten players are desirable with the fifty-two card pack, and
not more than six with the thirty-two card one, as otherwise too great a proportion of the
pack is brought into use each deal, and there is not much scope for speculation as to what
remains in the undealt portion of the pack.

In playing the game the ace is reckoned the highest card, then follow king, queen, knave, ten,
etc., down to two.

The first dealer is decided in the manner explained in connection with "Nap" (see page 9),
and he has to pay two coins or counters into the pool, each of the other players contributing
one.  Three cards are then dealt to each player, one at a time, and going round from left to
right.  The top card remaining on the pack is turned up for trump, but [78] before turning
it the dealer may sell it to any other of the players.  If the dealer sells the turn-up card,
the buyer becomes entitled to all the privileges that may ultimately attach to it, taking the
entire amount in the pool if no higher trump is turned up during the progress of the hands.

The player next to the dealer, or if the dealer sold the turn-up card the one next to the purchaser,
then turns up the top card of the three dealt him.  If it proves to be a higher card of the
trump suit than that already exposed, he becomes the chief hand, and may either retain the
card, with the ultimate prospect of winning the pool, or he may sell it to either of the other
players if a speculation can be arranged.  If he sells the card, he passes it over to the purchaser,
and the player on the left-hand side of the new holder becomes the next player.  If the card
turned up is not a trump, or is a lower trump than that already exposed, it is of no value,
and the next player has to follow on with his top card.

The same proceeding is continued round and round until all the players, except the holder of
the highest trump, have exposed their three cards. The owner of the leading trump, or the dealer,
if he did not sell the turn-up and it remains unbeaten, does not expose his cards in the various
rounds, but retains them until last.  Even then he may sell them, before they are turned up,
either singly or all together.

When all the cards have been exposed, the holder of the highest trump takes the amount in the
pool, and a fresh deal, with new payments to the pool, is started upon.

If the card turned up proves to be an ace, king, queen, or knave, it is usual for the deal
to pass.  In that case the dealer, or the purchaser of the trump card if the dealer has sold
it, takes the pool, when all the players contribute as before, the next in turn becoming the
dealer, and using the next top card of the pack for his trump card.  This method [79] saves
the time of going all round with the hands, when with so high a card turned up there are so
few chances of either of the players having a better one, as to virtually put an end to all
speculation that hand.

During the progress of the game either of the players may sell the card which it is his turn
to expose.  In that case he turns it up without disturbing the order of play, and retains it
if it is not a superior trump. If it is a superior one, it has to be handed over to the purchaser,
and the player on his left has to proceed with the play.

The holder of the highest trump card may sell it at any time, so that it may change hands several
times during the same deal, and each time there is a change the player on the buyer's left-hand
side is the next to proceed.

Any player looking at a card out of turn has to pay a penalty into the pool, and should he
prove the winner he cannot take the amount in the pool, but must leave it to be added to the
stakes for the next deal.

It is sometimes agreed that the turn-up card shall belong to the pool, and in that case it
is not offered for sale.  If it proves the ultimate Winner of the round, the amount is left
in the pool, and added to the stake for the next deal, the amount of which is made up just
as if the previous one had been taken by one of the players.

A second method of benefiting the pool is to deal a spare hand, which is left in the middle
of the table until all the other hands have been finished.  The spare hand is then turned up,
and if it contains a winning card the amount in the pool is added to the stake for the next round.

Another variation is to impose a penalty when a knave or five is turned up, the penalty being
paid into the pool by the owner of the card, that is, the original holder or the purchaser
if it was sold before being turned up.

[80]

POPE JOAN.

For the game of Pope, or Pope Joan, a special board, or a pool with eight compartments, is
required, or the divisions may be marked on a sheet of paper or card.  The game is available
for any number of players, and an ordinary pack of fifty-two cards is used, the eight of diamonds
being taken out, so as to form what is termed a stop, that is, a break in the sequence of the
cards, which are here reckoned in regular order from ace to king, the four suits being kept
distinct throughout the play.  The seven of diamonds thus becomes a stop, and the king of each
Suit is also a stop, there being no "following" card in either case.  The turn-up or trump
card, as will be further explained later on, forms another stop, and thus there are six regular
known stops at the commencement of each game, with a number of unknown ones caused by the cards
in the spare hand which forms part of the game.

The object of the players is to dispose of their cards as rapidly as possible, under certain
conditions, and the player who first succeeds in clearing his hand wins the stake set apart
for game, as well as a contribution from the other players for each of the cards remaining
in their hands.  The holders of certain other cards secure the stakes contributed for them
if they play them out during the progress of the hands.

[81]

The earliest matter for consideration is to determine who shall be the first dealer, and that
is settled in the same way as at "Nap" (see page 9).  The players then contribute between them
fifteen (or more) counters or coins to form a pool, the dealer giving double the amount paid
by the other players.  The counters or coins are then distributed so as to dress the eight
divisions of the board, which are named as follows:-- Pope Joan (the nine of diamonds), Matrimony
(king and queen of trumps), Intrigue (queen and knave of trumps), Ace, King, Queen, Knave (of
trumps), and Game, which latter is secured by the player who first succeeds in disposing of
all the cards dealt him.  Six of the counters are placed for Pope Joan, two each for Matrimony
and Intrigue, one each for Ace, King, Queen, and Knave, and the remainder for Game.  To save
the trouble and time of collecting the stakes from the several players for each round, it is
often agreed that the dealer for the time being shall dress the board, in which case it is
necessary that the game should be finished just before the original dealer's turn comes round
again, else the payments to the pool will not have been equitably divided.

The stakes being completed, the pack, from which the eight of diamonds has been removed, is
shuffled and cut.  The dealer then proceeds to distribute the cards, one at a time, as equally
among the players as possible, dealing a spare hand, which is left unexposed on the table,
for the purpose of forming further stops, and turning up the last card for trump.  If any odd
cards remain after dealing round to the players, it is best to add the surplus to the spare
hand.  For instance, with five players there will be eight cards for each hand, one to turn
up, and two remaining; these two should be added to the spare hand. The Doctor delivered this address
to his man of influence with the calmness of an ambassador charged with a message from a sovereign,
for which he is no otherwise responsible than to speak it in the most intelligible manner; and
then, taking up his hat and cane, he bade him good morning, leaving
Simeon Brown in a tumult of excitement which no previous theological
discussion had ever raised in him.

CHAPTER XI

THE PRACTICAL TEST.

The hens cackled drowsily in the barnyard of the white Marvyn-house; in the blue June-afternoon
sky sported great sailing islands of cloud, whose white, glistening heads looked in and out through
the green apertures of maple and blossoming apple-boughs; the shadows of the trees had already
turned eastward, when the one-horse wagon of Mrs. Katy Scudder appeared at the door, where Mrs.
Marvyn stood, with a pleased, quiet welcome in her soft, brown eyes. Mrs. Scudder herself drove, sitting
on a seat in front,--while the Doctor, apparelled in the most faultless style, with white
wrist-ruffles, plaited shirt-bosom, immaculate wig, and well-brushed
coat, sat by Mary's side, serenely unconscious how many feminine cares
had gone to his getting-up. He did not know of the privy consultations,
the sewings, stitchings, and starchings, the ironings, the brushings,
the foldings and unfoldings and timely arrangements, that gave such
dignity and respectability to his outer man, any more than the serene
moon rising tranquilly behind a purple mountain-top troubles her calm
head with treatises on astronomy; it is enough for her to shine,--she
thinks not how or why.

There is a vast amount of latent gratitude to women lying undeveloped
in the hearts of men, which would come out plentifully, if they only
knew what they did for them.

The Doctor was so used to being well dressed, that he never asked why. That his wig always
sat straight and even around his ample forehead, not facetiously poked to one side, nor assuming
rakish airs, unsuited to clerical dignity, was entirely owing to Mrs. Katy Scudder. That his best
broadcloth coat was not illustrated with shreds and patches, fluff and dust, and hanging in
ungainly folds, was owing to the same. That his long silk stockings never had a treacherous stitch
allowed to break out into a long running ladder was due to her watchfulness; and that he wore

The Doctor little thought, while he, in common with good ministers generally, gently traduced
the Scriptural Martha and insisted on the duty of heavenly abstractedness,
how much of his own leisure for spiritual contemplation was due to
the Martha-like talents of his hostess.

    But then, the good soul had it in him to be grateful,
    and would have been unboundedly so, if he had known his indebtedness,--as,
we trust, most of our magnanimous masters would be.

Mr. Zebedee Marvyn was quietly sitting in the front summer parlor, listening to the story of two
of his brother church-members, between whom some difficulty had arisen in the settling of
accounts: Jim Bigelow, a small, dry, dapper little individual, known as general jobber and factotum,
and Abram Griswold, a stolid, wealthy, well-to-do farmer.

And the fragments of conversation we catch are not uninteresting, as showing Mr. Zebedee's habits
of thought and mode of treating those who came to him for advice.

"I could 'ave got along better, if he'd 'a' paid me regular every
night," said the squeaky voice of little Jim;--"but he was allers
puttin' me off till it come even change, he said."

"Well, 'ta'n't always handy," replied the other; "one doesn't like to break into a five-pound note for
nothing; and I like to let it run till it comes even change."

"You
see what the Bible has to say on the matter," he said.

"Well, now, Deacon, I rather think you've got me in a tight place,"
said Mr. Griswold, rising; and turning confusedly round, he saw the
placid figure of the Doctor, who had entered the room unobserved in
the midst of the conversation, and was staring with that look of calm,
dreamy abstraction which often led people to suppose that he heard
and saw nothing of what was going forward.

All rose reverently; and while Mr. Zebedee was shaking hands with the
Doctor, and welcoming him to his house, the other two silently withdrew,
making respectful obeisance.

Mrs. Marvyn had drawn Mary's hand gently

VARIATIONS.

The most popular variation from the foregoing game is for the winner, i.e. the one who first
plays out his cards, to only take the stake for Game from the board, the players paying to
the pool the penalty for their unplayed card or cards, and distributing them on whichever chance
they prefer, except that all the eight must be covered.  In such a case the regular dressing
of the board by the players at the commencement of each deal as previously described is omitted,
the dealer alone paying a single stake, which he may also place where he chooses.

FIVE-POOL POPE.

The board or pool may be made with five divisions only, in which case Pope Joan, Matrimony,
Intrigue, Ace, and Game are retained, King, Queen, and Knave being omitted.  In other respects
the game is conducted on the ordinary lines, except that twelve coins or counters are sufficient
to dress the board.

POPE JOAN WINS.

In this variation, when Pope Joan is turned up the dealer at once wins the game, and takes
the stake standing to Game on the board, in addition to that on Pope and the payment from each
of the players already referred to.  This is by no means a desirable innovation, and simply
causes extra trouble for dealing, etc., with little or no recompense.

LIMITED STOPS.

In lieu of the spare hand being dealt, with the object of making extra stops, it may be arranged
that a definite [86] number of cards be taken from the pack, either from the top or the bottom,
for the purpose, or the remainder, after dealing the cards round as far as possible equally
among the players, may be so set apart.  The best way, however, is to deal a spare hand with
the others, as then the number of stops bears an equitable proportion to the number of players
engaged in the game.

LOOKING AT THE SPARE HAND.

Among amateurs and inexperienced players it is sometimes agreed that the dealer shall look
at the spare hand, so as to see what cards are stops; but after a few rounds have been played,
the absurdity of this rule will be manifest.  It gives so much advantage to the dealer, who
can play cards which he alone knows to be stops, that in such a case he ought to stand out,
no cards being dealt him that round.  It is an altogether objectionable variation, and not
at all a necessary one.

Pope Joan is sometimes allowed to be played at any time in lieu of a stop, thus: suppose a
player has Pope and (say) knave of spades. In the course of the game the nine of spades is
played, and proves to be a stop.  The holder of Pope may play it in lieu of the ten of spades,
and then continue with his knave of that suit, first taking his winnings on Pope.

[87]

SPIN.

Spin may be regarded somewhat as a variation or offshoot of Pope Joan, which game it very much
resembles.  The dealer will therefore do well to refer to the description given of that game,
on pages 81 to 87, for further and more extended details.

At Spin the two of hearts is taken out of the pack, in addition to the eight of diamonds, but
in distributing the cards no spare hand is dealt, so that there are always six regular stops
in the game.  In addition, the ace of diamonds, which is called Spin, may also be used as a
stop, if the player chooses to make it one, and he has the necessary card with which to follow,
as explained later on.

There are only three pool chances to play for in this game: Matrimony (king and queen of diamonds),
Intrigue (queen and knave of diamonds), and Game, or first out.  In addition to these three
chances, the holder of Spin receives a stake (usually three counters) from the other competitors,
provided the card is played out in the ordinary course of the game; while each king entitles
its holder to one counter from every competitor when they are played out.  In both these cases
the amounts must be collected before another card is played, or they are forfeited.

The pool is made by each player, except the dealer, paying in a stake for Game, while the dealer
has to contribute a double stake to make a pool for Matrimony, and a single stake for Intrigue.
He is sometimes called upon to con[88]tribute to Game also, but that is putting a tax upon
him disproportionate to what is required from the other players.

The two of hearts and eight of diamonds having been taken out, the cards are shuffled and then
dealt out, as near equally as possible, among the players.  No turn-up card is needed, as there
are no trumps in this game.  The player on the dealer's left has the lead, and he proceeds
in the manner described for Pope Joan (see page 84).

The holder of Matrimony or Intrigue can declare them at any time after he plays a stop, and
he then takes the stake for those chances in the pool.  He need not play the cards, but simply
shows them, and may then follow on, as he has a right to do after a stop, with any card he chooses.

The holder of Spin can play it at any time when either of his other cards comes in sequence
in the progress of the game, or after a stop. In the former case, the playing of Spin makes
it a stop, but it must be played out with the card which follows on, or the holder loses his
chance of playing it.  For instance, suppose clubs are in play, that the six is the last card,
and that the holder of the seven has Spin. He plays the two cards together, and says, "seven
and Spin." The other competitors then pay him the agreed stake for Spin, and the game proceeds.
If the holder of Spin does not succeed in playing it he has to pay double to the winner of
the game for every card remaining in his hand.

When one of the players has played all his cards, he becomes the winner, and the others pay
him a stake for each card remaining in their hands. In addition he takes the amount of the
pool set apart for first out. The winner of the game is also exempt from payment towards the
next pool for Game.  If, however, the winner is the next dealer, then he has to contribute
to Matrimony and Intrigue in the ordinary course.

[89]

NEWMARKET.

This is another variation of Pope Joan, or Spin, and is played on similar lines.  The seven
of each suit is taken out to form stops, and four cards are turned up in the middle of the
table.  These must be the four principal cards, viz., ace, king, queen, and knave, but of different
suits, so that each of the four are represented in the pool; say, for example, knave of diamonds,
queen of hearts, king of clubs, and ace of spades may be turned up.

The several players pay a coin or counter to form the first pool, and may put it on whichever
card of the four turned up they choose, provided that all four are covered.  The dealer pays
one extra throughout the game.  The whole of the cards are then dealt, as nearly equal as possible,
as for Spin.  Play proceeds as in that game, the holder of the card immediately preceding those
in the pool taking the stake upon it when he plays his card.  For this purpose the ace is considered
both as lowest and highest, so that, in the supposed cases given above, the holders of king
of spades, queen of clubs, knave of hearts, and ten of diamonds become winners of pool stakes
on playing out their respective cards.  These would in each case become stops, and the player
would have the right to play another card.

The one who first succeeds in clearing his hand wins the game, and receives from each of the
other competitors a stake for every remaining card.  The pool stakes cannot be taken unless
the cards are played up to, and if this is not done the amounts are carried on to the next
deal. The hints and fuller explanation given in Pope Joan and Spin should be studied in connection
with this game.

[90]

SNIP-SNAP-SNORUM.

There are two distinct methods of playing this game, so unlike as to lead to the conclusion
that at some time or other two separate games must have been confused by being called under
the same name, and have since been so associated with each other.  There is hardly one point
in common between the two methods in vogue; and while one is entirely different from anything
yet described in the present volume, the other is, to a great extent, played on the lines of
Pope Joan, Spin, and Newmarket, and may be regarded as an offshoot of those games--rather than
as an independent one--which has got mixed with the one known under the title of Snip-Snap-Snorum,
and has come to be recognised under that name.  As preference in such a case should be given
to the independent game, we shall first describe that, and afterwards devote attention to the
other system.  In doing so we must excuse ourselves for the manifest inconsistency of associating
two distinct games under the one title, on the ground of custom and practice among different
individuals, and in order to avoid confusion as far as possible, we have re-named the game
we shall describe last, as Jig, that being one of the terms used in the game, and sufficiently
distinctive for every purpose.

Snip-Snap-Snorum is a round game, available for any number, of players from two to ten, when
the full pack of fifty-two cards is played with, or for any number up to six [91] when the
smaller pack of thirty-two is used. Probably the best number of players is five or six in the
former case, and three or four in the latter; the greatest objection to a large number of players
being that those first out have to wait until the others have exhausted their stakes, which
may not occur until several more rounds have been completed.

At the commencement of the game each player has to be provided with five coins or counters,
of equal value, and the game is decided when all but one of the players has exhausted those
five stakes.  The player who holds out the longest becomes the winner, and secures the whole
of the pool, which is contributed to during the progress of the game as described later on.

The deal is decided in the ordinary way, the player to whom the first knave is turned up having
the first right to deal the cards.  He shuffles the pack, has it cut, and then distributes
five cards to each player, one at a time, and commencing with the one on his left-hand side.
There is no turn-up card needed; when all have received their five cards the hands are looked
at, and the game begins.  The object of the players is to play cards of equal value to those
of their right-hand adversaries, and if they do so the player has to pay a penalty into the
pool; one stake for Snip, which is the first pairing of a card; two stakes for Snap, the second
pairing of the same card; and three stakes for Snorum, the third pairing.  For instance, suppose
there are five players, A, B, C, D, and E.  A is the dealer, and, the cards having been dealt,
B has to lead; he plays a nine, and calls it when he places it on the table face upwards in
front of him; C likewise has a nine, which he must play by also placing it face upwards on
the table in front of him, and says "Snip," upon which B has to pay a stake into the pool,
his card having been paired D also has [92] a nine, which he plays in similar manner, and says
"Snap," upon which C has to pay two stakes into the pool, his card having been also paired;
E then has to follow on, and also having a nine in hand, he must play it, and says "Snorum,"
which imposes a penalty of three stakes upon D.  This having disposed of the four nines in
the pack, A, whose turn it now is to play, has to start upon a new card, and he has the option
of playing whichever of the five in his hand he chooses.

The penalties of Snip-Snap-Snorum do not remain in force if any other card intervenes between
the pairs, so that it is only the player next in order of play who has the opportunity of securing
a stack& for the pool from any of the others.  Taking the illustration given above, we will
suppose that D had no nine, and was accordingly compelled to play, say, a ten.  B would have
had to pay the penalty for Snip, as before; but C could have nothing to pay, his card not having
been paired.  Then suppose E, in his turn, played a nine, and A also played one, that would
only "snip" E's nine, although the other two nines had just been played; E would have to pay
one stake to the pool.

As soon as the five cards dealt to each player are exhausted, the next in order becomes the
dealer, and distributes five cards to each player, as before, and the game is conducted round
and round on exactly similar lines until one of the party has lost the last of his five stakes.
He is then out of the game, and if he has any cards left he must add them, face downwards and
unexposed, to the top of the undealt portion of the pack.  The other players proceed with the
game, and as each loses his last stake he is left out, and no fresh cards are dealt him.  This
goes on until all but one have lost their stakes, when, as already described, the game is finished,
and the last in takes the pool.

[93]

If a new game is started on, the first out in the previous game becomes the new dealer.

The lead is a disadvantage in this game, as, after a few cards have been played, it is often
possible to know that certain cards remaining in hand are absolutely safe, or nearly so.  For
instance, suppose two knaves have been played during the first round or two, and that a third
knave is in a player's hand, that card may be played as an almost safe one, as there is only
one other that can pair with it, and the odds of the fourth knave being in the next player's
hand are very remote.  For the same reason a player having two of a kind in his own hand should
always play one of them when his turn comes round, provided, of course, he is not able to pair
with the player immediately preceding him.

If a player has a card similar to that played immediately before him, he must play it.  In
the event of his failing to do so, he has to pay a double penalty to the pool, while the player
who would have been penalized has to contribute just as though the right card had been played.
These penalties must be enforced before the cards are cut for the next deal.

VARIATIONS.

This method of playing the game is sometimes varied as follows: Instead of dealing five cards
to each player, the whole of the pack is distributed, equally; or as nearly equal as possible,
among the players, each of whom starts with five coins or counters, as in the other game. 
The player on the dealer's left-hand side, whom we will call B, as above, has to lead, and
he keeps on playing one card after another until the opponent on his left (C) can pair one
of them.  When C succeeds in doing this, he says "Snip," and B has to pay a stake into the
pool, while he remains in [94] active until the game has proceeded right round the table. 
Play now rests between C and D.  If D can pair C's card with which he snipped B he does so,
and calls "Snap," when C has to pay two stakes to the pool; if then E can also pair the card,
he cries "Snorum," and D has to pay three stakes to the pool.  If, however, the players cannot
pair, then C has to keep on playing out his cards until D can pair one, in which case C is
snipped, and the game proceeds as just described.  The game goes round until all have played
their cards, when the pack is again shuffled, and a new deal started upon, the game being won
and the stakes secured by the player who holds out the longest with his five stakes, as in
the other game.

This variation may be altered again by agreeing that an unlimited number of coins or counters
may be used, and that the player who first succeeds in getting rid of his cards shall be the
winner of the pool.  By this system each deal becomes complete in itself, but it will not be
found a very desirable innovation if many players are engaged, as in that case the cards are
so divided that it becomes an easy matter to clear a hand.

TURN-UP SNIP.

It is sometimes agreed that the dealer shall turn up the top card of the undealt portion of
the pack, and if then the first player can match it, the dealer has to pay the penalty for
Snip.  A much better way of playing this variation, however, is for the pool to pay the penalty
for this first Snip. In that case the player takes one counter out of the pool and adds it
to his own stock.

[95]

JIG.

We have already mentioned that our reason for adopting the above title is to distinguish this
method of playing the game of Snip-Snap-Snorum from the one just described, and it will be
evident to those who study the two systems that we are quite justified in introducing a distinctive
name for the one we are now about to deal with, which, as we have said, has little or nothing--beyond
former title and use of similar terms--in common with the other.

The first dealer having been settled, and the pack shuffled, the cards are dealt out one at
a time until the pack is exhausted.  The object of the players is to get rid of their cards
as speedily as possible, the one first out winning a coin or counter from each of the other
players for every card remaining in their hands.  The player on the dealer's left-hand side
has to play first, and he leads whichever card he chooses, placing it face upwards on the table
in front of him, and saying "Snip"; the holder of the next highest card of the same suit (ace
counting as lowest and king as highest) has to follow on, and says "Snap"; then the three next
highest cards are played, the holders of them saying "Snorum," "Hicockalorum" and "Jig" respectively,
when playing them.  The one who plays Jig has the next lead, and may follow on with whichever
card he chooses.  If either of the cards played is a stop,--that is to say, the succeeding
card has been played out, or it is a king,--then the player says "Jig" after announcing what
card he plays, as, for [96] instance, "Snip-Jig," "Snap-Jig," and so on. The player of the
stop has to lead the next card.

It will thus be seen that the object of the players should be to lead such cards as will bring
the Jig into their own hand again whenever possible, as then another card has to be led, and
a greater chance exists of clearing the hand.  To do this successfully, it is necessary to
remember what cards are played during the progress of the game, so as to know which are stops,
and then, if the stops are in hand, such cards should be played as would lead up to them. 
It will be well to bear in mind the following, which gives a list of the "Jigs" to the several
cards of the pack:--

The five is "Jig" to the ace. | The ten is "Jig" to six.
 "  six        "     two.     |  "  knave     "     seven.
 "  seven      "     three.   |  "  queen     "     eight.
 "  eight      "     four.    |  "  king      "     nine, ten,
 "  nine       "     five.    |        knave or queen.

Similarly, if the two, three, or four is a stop, the ace, two or three may be played so as
to lead up to them and thus secure the Jig.

When one of the party has exhausted his cards, he says "Out," and then receives a coin or counter
from each player for every card they have left, and he also wins the amount in the pool if
one has been formed.  This is possible in many ways: either by each player contributing to
it equally, by calling upon the dealer to pay in, or by the infliction of fines or penalties
for incorrect calls, etc.

It is hardly necessary to give further details of the method of playing the hands, the game
being so similar to Pope Joan, Spin, and Newmarket, which are fully described elsewhere.  Players
will do well to refer to those games for further information in regard to this variation of
Snip-Snap-Snorum.

[97]

CASSINO.

This game, which is of considerable antiquity, is available for two, three, four, or more persons,
but is usually played by four, when two of the players act as partners against the other two.
It is, however, equally available for four players acting independently, in which case each
scores his individual points, whereas in the partnership game, as with only two players, the
lesser number of points is taken from the greater, and the difference only is scored by the
winner.  With three players it is also necessary to score independently, although in all these
independent scorings it is sometimes decided that the lowest scorer shall not reckon anything,
while the number of his points is deducted from those of each of the others; as, for instance:
suppose A made 1 point, B 2, C 3 and D 5; A would not score anything, while B would score 1,
C 2, and D 4.  Similarly, if A made 2 points, B 2, C 2 and D 5; D would be the only one to
score, and he would count 3.

It is usual to play with the full pack of fifty-two cards; there is however no reason why the
smaller pack of thirty-two should not be used, but in that case the hands would be of shorter
duration.

Assuming that four persons intend to take part in the game, and that they decide to play in
pairs, the first question to settle will be as to who shall be partners, and who the first
dealer.  This is arranged by each of the four [98] players taking a card from the top or other
part of the pack, when those who draw the two lowest cards have to play against the drawers
of the two highest.  The lowest of the four (ace counting as lowest) becomes the first dealer.
In the event of a tie, which prevents the decision being thus made, only those whose cards
are alike draw a second time.  The partners sit opposite to each other, and the cards of each
player are kept distinct until the hands are completed by the entire pack having been played
through.

The cards having been shuffled and cut, the dealer distributes four cards to each of the players,
dealing them one at a time.  He also places four other cards face upwards in the middle of
the table.  It is usual to deal these latter one at a time when going round with the regular
hands, but they may be taken all at one time from the top of the pack, after the players have
received their cards.  The player on the left-hand side of the dealer then plays a card from
his own hand, and takes with it every card of the same denomination among those exposed on
the table, as well as all that will combine and make the same number.  For instance, a ten
not only takes every other ten, but also nine and ace, eight and two, seven and three, six
and four, or two fives, two threes and a four, and other combinations.

If the player is able to pair or combine any of the cards, he places them with his own card
face downwards on the table in front of him; but if he is not able to pair or combine, he must
add a card, face upwards, to those already exposed on the table.  The next player does the
same, and so on round the table until the four cards in hand have either been paired, combined,
or added to the exposed stock on the table.  The original dealer then distributes four fresh
cards to each of the players, but does not expose any on the table as in the first round. 
The same proceeding [99] is repeated until the whole pack has been exhausted, the player who
is last able to pair or combine any of the exposed cards taking all the remaining cards off
the table, and scoring one point for thus "sweeping the board," as it is termed.  If a player
is able to sweep the board at any other time during the progress of the game, he also scores
a point, and the following player has to commence a new board by laying out a card.

The whole of the cards having thus been played, the partners combine their winnings, and the
counting of the cards commences, the various points of the game being as follow:

The winner of Great Cassino (the ten of
   diamonds) reckons      ...  ...  ...  ...  2 points.

The winner of Little Cassino (the two of
   spades) reckons   ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  1 point.

The winner of each ace reckons ...  ...  ...  1   "

The winner of the majority of the cards of
   the spade suit reckons      ...  ...  ...  1   "

The winner of the majority of the entire pack
   of cards reckons  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  3 points.

The partners whose winnings show the greater number of points then deduct the points of their
opponents from their own, and score the remainder to their game; thus, if one sides secures
6, and the other side 5, the former score 1 point and the latter score nothing; while if the
respective scores were 7 and 4, the winners of the seven points would add to their score.

The object of those engaged in the game being to secure Great Cassino, Little Cassino, the
four aces, the majority of spades, and the greater number of cards, a few rules will at once
suggest themselves to guide the play of the hands.  [100] Secure the Cassino cards on the first
opportunity, also aces and spades, after which aim to make as many combinations as possible,
leaving the pairs until last, unless they be the ten or the two, which are always best got
off the board as early as possible, so as to prevent the opponents making the Cassinos if they
have them in hand.

When three players are engaged, it is sometimes agreed that the two lowest shall add their
points together, and subtract them from the highest. In such a case, if the two lower numbers
together either amount to or exceed the higher, then neither party scores.  This method will
not be found desirable in actual play, as it leads to so many hands resulting in a negative score.

If a card is exposed by the dealer in the first round, other than those dealt for the exposed
hand, then the deal is forfeited, but the exposure of a card at a subsequent period does not
disqualify the dealer, the player being compelled to take the exposed card, although it is
best to impose some penalty for the fault.

[101]

MY BIRD SINGS.

This game may be played by any number of persons up to thirteen, if a full pack of cards be
used; or by any number up to eight with the smaller pack of thirty-two cards.  A pool is formed
by each player contributing a counter or coin, the dealer paying one extra.  Four cards are
then dealt to each player, and all have the right to look at their hands.

The object of the players is to secure a flush, four cards of one suit; or four cards of different
suits; and when either of these combinations is secured, the player says: "My Bird sings,"
and he becomes the winner, and thereby entitled to the amount in the pool.

There are two methods of conducting the game: either by each player in turn throwing out a
card from his hand, or by allowing the opponent on his left-hand side to take one.

The competitor on the dealer's left is the first to play, and, supposing his "Bird" does not
already "sing," and the first-named method is adopted, he throws out one of his cards, face
downwards, on the table.  The player on his left adds this card to his own four, and if his
"Bird" does not "sing," he in like manner throws one of his cards out for the next player;
the same plan being adopted round and round, until one of the players secures the four cards
necessary.

If the second method is adopted the player does not [102] himself reject a card, but turns
his hand, without exposing it, to the next player, who selects whichever card he chooses, and
proceeds with the game as in the other variation.

After going completely round among the players three times, the original leader may exchange
one of his cards for the top card of the undealt portion of the pack, and if it should happen
to be of the same suit as the one he threw out, he rejects it, and takes the next or following
one, until he gets a different suit; but before introducing a new card into the game he must
throw out one of those in hand.  This introduction of new cards may be made each round, after
the first three of a hand, until one of the players secures a winning set of cards, otherwise
it may be a tedious matter to get a winning combination.

VARIATIONS.

The game is sometimes played for flushes only; that is, the four cards must be of one suit
before a player's "Bird sings," and sometimes only three cards are dealt to each player, in
which latter case flushes alone are recognised.

The game may also be continued until the whole pack of cards is exhausted; in which case, whenever
a player's bird sings, he turns the four cards over and regards them as one trick.  Four other
cards are then given him from the top of the undealt portion of the pack, and the game proceeds
as before.  The ultimate winner is he who secures the greatest number of tricks.  In the case
of a tie the stakes are divided between the two or more players who have an equal number.

[103]

SPOIL-FIVE

Spoil-Five may be played by any number of persons not exceeding ten; the best game, however,
is when four or live take part, as then about half the cards are in play.  In this game the
cards run in different order to the ordinary course, vary in the two colours, and further,
change in the trump suit, as follows:

This room has been keeping a low-studded flat, finished with heavy oak beams
to the wall completely left, went over and painted. Two windows looked
down the street, and another in a kind of courtyard, where three
black wenches, each with a broom, claimed to be overwhelming, but
there were actually chattering and laughing, like so many crows .

On one side of the room was a heavy mahogany buffet, covered with
decanters labeled gin, brandy, rum, etc. - for Simeon was regarded
as the best provider, but none in his household.

Heavy mahogany chairs with crewel coverings, stood sentinel on room
and fireplace was flanked by two large chairs covered with embossed
leather.

The Doctor opens the apartment, Simeon took him kindly to buffet.

"We make our discussions mus'n't too dry, Doc," he said. "What will you
get?"

"Thank you, sir," said the doctor, with a wave of his hand, - "nothing
in this morning."

And storage in a chair armed
hat, he settled in a leather easy chairs, and, dropping his hands on his knees,
he looked straight into his face, like a man who is studying how
to enter a topic internal absorption.

"Well, Doctor," said Simeon,
seated opposite him, sipping a complimentary glass of rum and water,
our opinions seem to be making a noise in the world.  The top card of the undealt portion of the pack
is turned up for trump, and if it proves to be the ace, the dealer has the option of "robbing,"
as explained hereafter; and if it is not the ace, any one holding that card must rob before
he plays, before his turn comes round.

If the dealer makes a misdeal, or deals out of order, or exposes a card, he loses his turn
of dealing, and the next player in order takes his place; or it may be agreed that in case
of a misdeal the dealer shall have the option of dealing again after paying a second stake
for dealing into the pool.  The deal is an advantage, and in case of a slip in the distribution
of the cards, it will generally be found best to pay the penalty and deal again.

The game is opened by the player on the left-hand side of the dealer leading whichever of his
cards he chooses.  [105] If the card led be a trump, then all the players must follow suit
if they are able to do so, subject to certain exceptions explained below under the heading
of "Reneging."

If the ace of hearts is led, and another suit is trumps, it does not necessitate all the players
following suit, even though the ace of hearts is always reckoned as a trump.  The lead in this
case is considered as made from a plain suit, and the rules governing them are enforced.

If the card is not a trump, then the other players may trump the card, or follow suit, as they
please, but each must do the one or the other if he holds a card of the suit led if he does
not hold one of the suit, then he may discard either of the others, or play a trump, as he
prefers. The player of the highest card of the suit led, or of the highest trump, if trumps
have been played, wins the trick, and he plays first to the next. In deciding the winner the
cards are reckoned in the special order given above.

The game is continued until one player wins three tricks, when he takes the pool; or, failing
that, till all of the cards are played, when the game is spoilt, and each contributes to the
pool the reduced stake agreed upon.

ROBBING.

Robbing is one of the most important features of the game, inasmuch as if the player who holds
the ace of trumps omits to rob when his turn comes round, he is de-barred from winning the
pool that hand, even though he may secure the necessary number of tricks.

The method of robbing if the ace is turned up, is for the dealer to place one of his own cards
on the table face downwards in front of him, which card must not be exposed at any time during
the progress of the hand. He does not take the ace into his own hand until the others [106]
have played to the first trick, but when it comes to his turn he adds it to his hand, or he
may at once use it.  He must, however, throw out the card with which he intends to rob the
ace before the first card of the round is played, and reasonable time must be allowed to do
so.  The turn-up suit remains trump throughout the hand.

In the case of the ace not being turned up, and being in the hand of either of the players,
then the holder must rob the turn-up card when it comes to his turn to play to the first trick.
The manner of doing this is somewhat similar to that just described; the holder of the ace
rejects a card placing it face downwards on the table, and takes the turn-up card into his
hand.  He must do this when it is his turn to play, and before showing his first card, otherwise
he forfeits the privilege, and is, moreover, prohibited from winning the pool that round, no
matter how many tricks he may secure.  The same penalty is attached to the player who robs
the turn-up card without holding the ace.

As a variation, it may be agreed that robbing shall be optional, or shall not be recognised
as a part of the game.

RENEGING.

The holder of the five of trumps, the knave of trumps, or the ace of hearts, enjoys the privilege
of not being obliged to play them when a trump is led; but this privilege (which is called
reneging) only holds when the trump led is a lower one.  For instance, if the knave be led,
the holder of the ace of hearts is obliged to play it.

VARIATIONS.

A very good game may be played by allowing the cards to retain their ordinary sequence.  As
this avoids confusion, it is more suitable for family play.

[107]

TWO TRICKS WIN.

If five or more players are taking part in the game, it may be found desirable that the winner
of two tricks shall take the pool, or partnerships can be formed; otherwise a long continuation
of spoils may occur.

FIVING.

This variation is sometimes played when two persons, or two sets of partners are engaged in
the game.  It consists in allowing the non-dealer, providing he is not satisfied with his cards,
to ask the dealer to "five" it, when, if the dealer agrees, the trump card is removed, and
the next card is turned up for trump.  If that proves to be of the same suit as the original
turn-up, the next is taken, and so on until a change occurs. The right to five can only be
exercised once each hand.

JINKING.

A variation is sometimes made by the introduction of "jinking."  The winner of all five tricks
receives from each player his original stake in addition to the amount in the pool; if, however,
any player who has won three tricks goes on playing, thinking he can jink, and fails to do
so, he loses the pool which he would otherwise have won for his three tricks.

TWENTY-FIVE AND FORTY-FIVE.

Instead of the game being finished in one hand, it may continue until one player makes twenty-five,
or forty-five.  In this case there are no spoils, and every trick scores five to the winner.
Any player "jinking," i.e., winning the five tricks, wins the game.

[108]

LOTO.

There are many varieties of Loto, with pictures, flowers, letters, etc., instead of numbers,
which are known as Picture Loto, Botanical Loto, Spelling Loto, Geographical Loto, Historical
Loto, and so on.

These are mostly games for children, and are played in exactly the same way as numbered Loto.

This game in England is usually regarded as an amusement for young children; but it is one
capable of affording amusement to grown-up people, as may be seen by the interest shown in
"Keno" by the Americans.

"Keno," or American Loto, is played in various places of public resort, by adults, for considerable
stakes, and is esteemed capital practice in reading numbers rapidly and correctly.

The requisite paraphernalia for this game--which may be played by any number of persons, not
exceeding twenty-four--are boxes containing 100 counters; 14 fishes, each of which is reckoned
as 10 counters; 12 contracts, valued at 10 fish or 100 counters apiece; a pack of 24 very large
cards with fifteen different numbers marked on each, and a bag containing 90 knobs or discs,
numbered from 1 to 90.

   #==========================#
            Fig. 1.

In addition, a board with ten cavities cut therein for the purpose of placing the knobs as
drawn, is required.

[109]

A Loto card, on which are inscribed, in the manner shown in the diagram, numbers ranging from
1 to 90--five numbers on each line, is represented in fig 1.  The units are arranged in the
first column, the tens in the second, the twenties in the third, and so on.

The number of these cards supplied in a Loto box varies, but the general number is twenty-four,
although sometimes there are only eighteen. With twenty-four cards, each number appears in
four different cards.

There are several different methods of playing this game, of which we will give the two principal
ones.  The first method makes it a game of chance and skill, or rather quickness in reading
figures; and the second, purely a game of luck.

First Method.--Before commencing the game, a dealer has to be chosen, and his duties consist
of shuffling the cards and dealing to each player one or more cards.  The dealer is unable
to join in the game, and is obliged to stand out.

Each player should stake a certain sum, which should be reserved for the winner; and a certain
number of counters of no value, but merely to be used for covering the numbers as called, should
be placed in the pool.

Sometimes each player contributes a certain number of counters to the pool, then each saves
out of his stake the number of counters he has on his card or cards; and the winner obtains
the money for his fifteen counters on his card, and receives in addition all the pool which
remains.

In order to render the game still more interesting, the contributions to the pool should be
so arranged that it is capable of being divided into four parts.  Then a fourth part of the
pool is won by the player who first succeeds in covering one horizontal row; another fourth
part of the [110] pool is won by the player who first succeeds in covering two horizontal rows,
and the remaining half is reserved for the winner who first covers the whole of his card.

The dealer then, having deposited the 90 knobs in a bag, draws them forth rapidly, one by one,
and calls out the number which appears or the knob in a clear tone.

The player, having the corresponding number on his cards or cards, who first answers to the
number called, covers the number on the card or cards with one of the counters in the pool,
which should be so placed on the table as to be available for the use of all the players.

The player who first succeeds in covering all the numbers on his card or cards wins the game.

The Second Method.--Every player should draw two cards, and deposit a stake previously agreed
upon; and if the party is not too numerous, then any may take four or six cards, laying down
a double or treble stake accordingly; and when the players are more than twelve, then some
are only to have one card, paying half a stake, and likewise should the players not take all
the cards among them, the remainder of the pack is to be laid aside until some other persons
join the set.  From the cards not taken, players may exchange one or more of those drawn, or
they may change with one another; similar exchanges, if the company consent, may also be made
previous to each drawing, and likewise prior to replenishing the pool. Cards may be thrown
up, or additional ones drawn from those put by; stakes being paid proportionably.

The stakes are to be put together in a pool, placed in the middle of the table, and also on
the table there should be a quantity of counters sufficient for the number of cards taken;
upon the counters a value is to be fixed adequate to the stakes first deposited, from the whole
of which a sum [111] must be reserved, enough to pay, at the conclusion of the game, all the
counters laid upon the table.

Then, after counting the 90 knobs, so as to be certain they are right, the eldest hand shall
first shake them well together in the bag, and afterwards draw out ten successively, not only
declaring the number of each as drawn, but also placing the same conspicuously on the board.

As soon as a number is declared, each player having that number on one or more of his cards,
is to take up counters, sufficient to lay one upon that number every time it occurs, and so
on until the ten knobs are drawn. When only part of the pack is taken, and a number drawn happens
not to be upon any player's card, then the players may put away that knob till some person
takes a card on which it is printed.

When ten knobs are drawn out, every player examining the cards separately, and having only
one counter upon any horizontal line, wins for that no more than the said counter, which is
styled gaining by abstract; where two counters are on the same horizontal line of a separate
card, the player gains an ambo, and becomes entitled to five counters besides the two; when
three are upon the same line, the player obtains a terne, and is to receive 25 additional counters;
if four are on the same line, that is called a quaterne winning 100 counters additional; when
five occur on the same line, that makes a quinterne, gaining 250 additional counters, and the
player is entitled to payment out of the pool for all the above-mentioned acquisitions previous
to another drawing.  Instead of giving counters, payment for the same may at once be made from
the stock in the pool.

The knobs are then to be returned, and the bag given to the next player in rotation, who is
to shake the same, and draw, etc., as before stated.

[112]

Whenever the pool is exhausted, the players must contribute again, according to the number
of cards taken; and when it is resolved to finish the game, they agree among themselves to
have only a fixed number of drawings more. 

I've got some things to take care of up-town, and you can come over with Matlock and look things over;--just make
note of anything you'd like, and when I see them all, I'll let you know
what I'd like to charge for them. I'll be back in a few hours.  The players then, beginning with the eldest hand,
are to be paid out of the pool, as far as the money will go; and when that is expended, the
others remain unpaid, which is styled a Bankruptcy; lastly, the players should re-unite the
counters obtained from the pool with those that were on their cards, and receive payment for
them out of the fund reserved at the commencement of the game.

The counters requisite for the payment of the players are:--

For 24 cards 144 times ten.
 "  18  "    108     "
 "  12  "     72     "
 "   6  "     36     "

Consequently, 60 counters should be contributed for every card taken by a player
