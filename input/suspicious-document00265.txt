And MacKellar sat down suddenly, and held out his crutches to Hal. "The hat and coat are in
the front hall," he exclaimed. "Make a try for it!" His words were full of vigour, but like
Edstrom, his voice was trembling. He was no longer young, and could not take adventure gaily.

Hal and Keating ran downstairs, followed by Edstrom. Hal put on the coat and hat, and they
went to the back door, while at the same time Edstrom answered the bell in front.

The back door opened into a yard, and this gave, through a side gate, into an alley. Hal's
heart was pounding furiously as he began to hobble along with the crutches. He had to go at
MacKellar's slow pace--while Keating, at his side, started talking. He informed "Mr. MacKellar,"
in a casual voice, that the Gazette was a newspaper which believed in the people's cause, and
was pledged to publish the people's side of all public questions. Discoursing thus, they went
out of the gate and into the alley.

A man emerged from the shadows and walked by them. He passed within three feet of Hal, and
peered at him, narrowly. Fortunately there was no moon; Hal could not see the man's face, and
hoped the man could not see his.

Meantime Keating was proceeding with his discourse. "You understand, Mr. MacKellar," he was
saying, "sometimes it's difficult to find out the truth in a situation like this. When the
interests are filling their newspapers with falsehoods and exaggerations, it's a temptation
for us to publish falsehoods and exaggerations on the other side. But we find in the long run
that it pays best to publish the truth, Mr. MacKellar--we can stand by it, and there's no come-back."

Hal, it must be admitted, was not paying much attention to this edifying sermon. He was looking
ahead, to where the alley debouched onto the street. It was the street behind MacKellar's house,
and only a block from the railroad-track.

He dared not look behind, but he was straining his ears. Suddenly he heard a shout, in John
Edstrom's voice. "Run! Run!"

In a flash, Hal dropped the two crutches, and started down the alley, Keating at his heels.
They heard cries behind them, and a voice, sounding quite near, commanded, "Halt!" They had
reached the end of the alley, and were in the act of swerving, when a shot rang out and there
was a crash of glass in a house beyond them on the far side of the street.

Farther on was a vacant lot with a path running across it. Following this, they dodged behind
some shanties, and came to another street--and so to the railroad tracks. There was a long
line of freight-cars before them, and they ran between two of these, and climbing over the
couplings, saw a great engine standing, its headlight gleaming full in their eyes. They sprang
in front of it, and alongside the train, passing a tender, then a baggage-car, then a parlour-car.

"Here we are!" exclaimed Keating, who was puffing like a bellows.

Hal saw that there were only three more cars to the train; also, he saw a man in a blue uniform
standing at the steps. He dashed towards him. "Your car's on fire!" he cried.

"What?" exclaimed the man. "Where?"

"Here!" cried Hal; and in a flash he had sprung past the other, up the steps and into the car.

There was a long, narrow corridor, to be recognised as the kitchen portion of a dining-car;
at the other end of this corridor was a swinging door, and to this Hal leaped. He heard the
conductor shouting to him to stop, but he paid no heed. He slipped off his over-coat and hat;
and then, pushing open the door, he entered a brightly lighted apartment--and the presence
of the Coal King's son.

SECTION 12.

White linen and cut glass of the dining-saloon shone brilliantly under electric lights, softened
to the eye by pink shades. Seated at the tables were half a dozen young men and as many young
ladies, all in evening costume; also two or three older ladies. They had begun the first course
of their meal, and were laughing and chatting, when suddenly came this unexpected visitor,
clad in coal-stained miner's jumpers. He was not disturbing in the manner of his entry; but
immediately behind him came a fat man, perspiring, wild of aspect, and wheezing like an old
fashioned steam-engine; behind him came the conductor of the train, in a no less evident state
of agitation. So, of course, conversation ceased. The young ladies turned in their chairs,
while several of the young men sprang to their feet.

There followed a silence: until finally one of the young men took a step forward. "What's this?"
he demanded, as one who had a right to demand.

Hal advanced towards the speaker, a slender youth, correct in appearance, but not distinguished
looking. "Hello, Percy!" said Hal.

A look of amazement came upon the other's face. He stared, but seemed unable to believe what
he saw. And then suddenly came a cry from one of the young ladies; the one having hair the
colour of molasses taffy when you've pulled it--but all fluffy and wonderful, with stardust
in it. Her cheeks were pink and cream, and her brown eyes gazed, wide open, full of wonder.
She wore a dinner gown of soft olive green, with a cream white scarf of some filmy material
thrown about her bare shoulders.

She had started to her feet. "It's Hal!" she cried.

"Hal Warner!" echoed young Harrigan. "Why, what in the world--?"

He was interrupted by a clamour outside. "Wait a moment," said Hal, quietly. "I think some
one else is coming in."

The door was pushed violently open. It was pushed so violently that Billy Keating and the conductor
were thrust to one side; and Jeff Cotton appeared in the entrance.

The camp-marshal was breathless, his face full of the passion of the hunt. In his right hand
he carried a revolver. He glared about him, and saw the two men he was chasing; also he saw
the Coal King's son, and the rest of the astonished company. He stood, stricken dumb.

The door was pushed again, forcing him aside, and two more men crowded in, both of them carrying
revolvers in their hands. The foremost was Pete Hanun, and he also stood staring. The "breaker
of teeth" had two teeth of his own missing, and when his prize-fighter's jaw dropped down,
the deficiency became conspicuous. It was probably his first entrance into society, and he
was like an overgrown boy caught in the jam-closet.

Percy Harrigan's manner became distinctly imperious. "What does this mean?" he demanded.

It was Hal who answered. "I am seeking a criminal, Percy."

"What?" There were little cries of alarm from the women.

"Yes, a criminal; the man who sealed up the mine."

"Sealed up the mine?" echoed the other. "What do you mean?"

"Let me explain. First, I will introduce my friends. Harrigan, this is my friend Keating."

Billy suddenly realised that he had a hat on his head. Upon a rack the cans of salmon are drawn

family clinging to its back, is slowly coming into town.

Another, covered with the dust of travel, laden with bananas, hemp a red, upholstered silla, with a rattan back

Here, on a pleasant evening, to the lazy strumming of guitars, the village
population promenades, young men in white holding each other' s hands,
and blowing out a cloud of cigarette smoke; señoritas, in their cheap
red dresses, shuffling hopelessly along the road.

One of the local characters is entertaining a street- corner audience
with a droll song, while the town- crier, with his escort of municipal police,

They were always busy pounding rice in wooden mortars with long poles, thus making

in strips of dried tobacco, ready to be rolled up into long cigars,

nipa hat, straddling the heavy load. A mountain girl, bareheaded, carrying
a parasol, comes loping in to the mercado on a skinny pony saddled
with a month the town would be awakened by the siren whistle of the
little hemp- boat from Cebu all.

There. This whistle was the signal for the small boys to extract the
reluctant carabao from the cool, sticky wallow, and eggs, and squatted
at the entrance to the cockpit in an improvised mercado with the people
from the shore, who offered clams and yoke him to the creaking bamboo,
and the viands still hold out.

But these are placed upon the table down below, where hoi floated upon husks of
cocoanut, to and set in water ripples at the ford. At the untamed
light cart.

Then from the storehouses the fragrant picos of hemp would be piled
on, and the longsuffering. A talkative old baker lived a short way down
beast of burden, No aided and abetted by a rope run through his nose,
would haul the load down to the beach. While naked laborers were toiling
with the lading, carrying it upon their shoulders through the surf,
the Spanish captain and the mate, with rakishly- tilted Tam o' Shanter
caps, would light their cigarettes, stroll over to Ramon' warehouse
where the hemp was being weighed, and, seated on sour- smelling sacks
of copra, chat with old Ramon, partaking later of a dinner of balenciona,
gotta chicken and red- swamping.

When drawn up on shore they look like big mosquitoes, as the body in proportion to the rigging
seems quite insignificant. The peppers, cheese and guava. Much of the village life centers around the
river. Here in the early morning come the girls and women wrapped in robes of red and yellow stripes,
and with their hair unbound. In family parties the whole village takes a bath, the young men poising
their athletic bodies on an overhanging bank and plunging down into
the cool depths below, the children in the shallow water, and the
women breast- deep in the stream, washing their long hair.

Here also, during the hours, the women take their washing. Tying the chemise
below the arms, they squat down near the shore and beat the wet mass with a wooden
paddle on a rock. Meanwhile the children build extensive palaces of pebbles
on the bank; the carabaos, up to their noses in the river, dream in the
refreshing shade of overhanging trees. The air is vocal with the liquid
notes of birds, and fragrant with the heavy scent of flowers. A leaf-
green lizard creeps down on a horizontal trunk.

The broad of abacá rustle in the breeze; the graceful stalks of bamboo crackle like tin tubes. Around
the bend the evening you will see the tired men from the mountains, bending
under heavy loads of hemp, wade.

When finished, with its black paint, nipa gunwale, bamboo outriggers, and rat- lines made of parasitic
vines, it will put out from port with a big gamecock as a mascot rigid

put up a hopeless wail, while dogs without howl dismally and sympathetically.

And at the end of the nine days, the soul then being out of purgatory,
they will have a feast. A pig and a goat will be killed, padre with his
gown caught up above his knees, riding away to some confession; mountain
people traveling in single file, and girls with trays of merchandise upon
their heads. Down where the nipa jungle thickens, fishing bancas are drawn
up on the shore; and near by in a cocoanut- grove the old boatmaker
lives. The hull of the outlandish boat that, rowed with clumsy paddles

The town was laid out by. the Spaniards in the days when Padre Pedro
was the autocrat and representative of Spanish law.

The ruins of the former mission and the public gardens are now overgrown
with grass.

Sea- breezes sweep the power of Rome. Goats, carabaos, and ponies graze on the neglected
plaza shaded with camphor- trees. The two school buildings bearing
the forgotten holes Spanish arms are on the road to ruin and decay;
no signs of life in the disreputable municipio; the presidente probably
is deep in his the siesta, and the solitary guard of the carcel is
busily engaged in conversation with the single prisoner.

The only remains of Spanish grandeur in the village are the two ramshackle that are used
for hearses at state funerals. Most of the larger houses are, however, in
repair, for although the canvas ceilings and the board partitions
seem to be in need of paint.

These houses occupy the center of the town. They are of frame construction, painted blue and white.
The floors are made of rosewood bottom, situated in an annex to the
rear.

A walk through the main street leads past a row of native houses, built
on poles and shaded by banana- trees.

You are continually stepping over mats spread out and covered with
pounded corn, while pigs and chickens are shooed off by the excitation
of a piece of nipa, fastened to a string and operated from an upper
window of Under the house the loom is situated, where the women weave
fine cloth from piña and banana fibers and the wooden mortar used
for pounding rice- flour, which they baked in clean banana- leaves
and sweetened with brown sugar molded in the shells of cocoanuts.

Sometimes a Moro boat would drop into the bay, and the strange- looking
savages in tight- fitting, inaugurate rice- pounding bees.

Relays of young men, stripped for work,, surround the mortar, and,
to the accompaniment of guitars gaudy clothes would file through town
with spices, bark, and cloth for sale. From Bohol came the curious thatched
bancas, with their grass sails and bamboo outriggers, with cargoes of pottery,

Women in black veils with candles follow, mumbling prayers, the words
of which they do not understand.

The cemetery is surrounded by a coral wall, commanded by a gate that bears
a Latin epigram. The graves, as indicated by the mounds of dirt,
are never very deep, and while a few are guarded by wooden cross, forlornly
decorated by a withered bunch of flowers, most of the graves receive

Along the beach on bamboo racks the nets now occupies their former grisly

death is a matter of bad luck. It is advisable to hinder it with anting-
antings and medallions; but when it comes, the Filipino fatalist
will take it philosophically.

To the boys and girls a family death is the sensation of the year. It
means to them nine people eat at the first table; and the second table
and the third are finished of burning polloi and the lame, blind,
and halt down and eat.

And back of all this superficiality lies the great superstitious dread by means of which the Church of
Rome holds such authority. I got to know the little village very well-- join
the people in their foolish celebrations and their wedding feasts. I was among
when the town was swept by cholera; when, in their ignorance, they
built a dozen little shrines-- just nipa shelters for the Holy Virgin,
decorated with red and; the windows fitted with translucent shell.

Storehouses occupy the first floor, while the living rooms are reached
by a broad flight of stairs.

A bridge connects the dining- room with the kitchen, where the greasy cook,
often a Moro slave, works at a smoky fire of cocoanut- husks on an
earth cloth and colored grass-- and held processions carrying the
wooden saints and burning candles. Then the locusts came, and settled on
the rice- fields-- a great cloud of them, with whirring wings.

They rattled on the nipa roofs like rain. The children took tin pans
and drums and gave the enemy a noisy welcome.

But the rains fell in the night, and the next morning all the ground was strewn with locusts trying heavily
to fly.

The ancient drum of the town- crier ushered in the day of work, and
those who took this opportunity to pay their taxes at the municipio--
about a hundred- looking men.

They were equipped with working bolos, with their blades as sharp as scythes for cutting grass, and,
looking at them, you were forcibly reminded of another day, another army
with a similar accouterment. Even the presidente went barefooted as
he gave directions for the work.

Some were dispatched the grass around the church. Another squad hauled
heavy timbers, singing as they pulled in unison.

On Sunday mornings a young carabao was killed. The meat hacked off with

in to help.

The bride, with orange- blossoms in her hair, the daintiest kid slippers on" her feet, and dressed
in a white mist of piña, rode away in the new pony cart, the only

cent on the refreshments that were passed around. It is the custom in
the poorer families for the prospective groom to bond himself out
for a time to the bride' s father, or even to purchase her with articles
of merchandise.

A combination of commercial interests was the result, however, of the marriage of Bonito and Felicidad.

 Lying
here in the darkness and silence, Hal was realising what he had got himself in for. To employ
another simile, he was a man who begins a flirtation on the street, and wakes up next morning
to find himself married.

It was not that he had regrets for the course he had taken with Percy. No other course had
been thinkable. But while Hal had known these North Valley people for ten weeks, he had known
the occupants of Percy's car for as many years. So these latter personalities loomed large
in his consciousness, and here in the darkness their thoughts about him, whether actively hostile
or passively astonished, laid siege to the defences of his mind.

Particularly he found himself wrestling with Jessie Arthur. Her face rose up before him, appealing,
yearning. She had one of those perfect faces, which irresistibly compel the soul of a man.
Her brown eyes, soft and shining, full of tenderness; her lips, quick to tremble with emotion;
her skin like apple-blossoms, her hair with star-dust in it! Hal was cynical enough about coal-operators
and mine-guards, but it never occurred to him that Jessie's soul might be anything but what
these bodily charms implied. He was in love with her; and he was too young, too inexperienced
in love to realise that underneath the sweetness of girlhood, so genuine and so lovable, might
lie deep, unconscious cruelty, inherited and instinctive--the cruelty of caste, the hardness
of worldly prejudice. A man has to come to middle age, and to suffer much, before he understands
that the charms of women, those rare and magical perfections of eyes and teeth and hair, that
softness of skin and delicacy of feature, have cost labour and care of many generations, and
imply inevitably that life has been feral, that customs and conventions have been murderous
and inhuman.

Jessie had failed Hal in his desperate emergency. But now he went over the scene, and told
himself that the test had been an unfair one. He had known her since childhood, and loved her,
and never before had he seen an act or heard a word that was not gracious and kind. But--so
he told himself--she gave her sympathy to those she knew; and what chance had she ever had
to know working-people? He must give her the chance; he must compel her, even against her will,
to broaden her understanding of life! The process might hurt her, it might mar the unlined
softness of her face, but nevertheless, it would be good for her--it would be a "growing pain"!

So, lying there in the darkness and silence, Hal found himself absorbed in long conversation
with his sweetheart. He escorted her about the camp, explaining things to her, introducing
her to this one and that. He took others of his private-car friends and introduced them to
his North Valley friends. There were individuals who had qualities in common, and would surely
hit it off! Bob Creston, for example, who was good at a "song and dance"--he would surely be
interested in "Blinky," the vaudeville specialist of the camp! Mrs. Curtis, who liked cats,
would find a bond of sisterhood with old Mrs. Nagle, who lived next door to the Minettis, and
kept five! And even Vivie Cass, who hated men who ate with their knives--she would be driven
to murder by the table-manners of Reminitsky's boarders, but she would take delight in "Dago
Charlie," the tobacco-chewing mule which had once been Hal's pet! Hal could hardly wait for
daylight to come, so that he might begin these efforts at social amalgamation!

SECTION 17.

Towards dawn Hal fell asleep; he was awakened by Billy Keating, who sat up yawning, at the
same time grumbling and bewailing. Hal realised that Billy also had discovered troubles during
the night. Never in all his career as a journalist had he had such a story; never had any man
had such a story--and it must be killed!

Cartwright had got the reporters together late the night before and told them the news--that
the company had at last succeeded in getting the mine ready to be opened; also that young Mr.
Harrigan was there in his private train, prompted by his concern for the entombed miners. The
reporters would mention his coming, of course, but were requested not to "play it up," nor
to mention the names of Mr. Harrigan's guests. Needless to say they were not told that the
"buddy" who had been thrown out of camp for insubordination had turned out to be the son of
Edward S. Warner, the "coal magnate."

A fine, cold rain was falling, and Hal borrowed an old coat of Jerry's and slipped it on. Little
Jerry clamoured to go with him, and after some controversy Hal wrapped him in a shawl and slung
him onto his shoulder. It was barely daylight, but already the whole population of the village
was on hand at the pit-mouth. The helmet-men had gone down to make tests, so the hour of final
revelation was at hand. Women stood with wet shawls about their hunched shoulders, their faces
white and strained, their suspense too great for any sort of utterance. A ghastly thought it
was, that while they were shuddering in the wet, their men below might be expiring for lack
of a few drops of water!

The helmet-men, coming up, reported that lights would burn at the bottom of the shaft; so it
was safe for men to go down without helmets, and the volunteers of the first rescue party made
ready. All night there had been a clattering of hammers, where the carpenters were working
on a new cage. I reached my chambers. Sir Thomas had curiosity to know what book the man read, but was some
time before he could discover it; he still putting the book up if
any t one came toward him. The trial excited agony with which I regarded

"I wish you'd come."

"I don't feel comfortable about it, Hal. I'm here as Percy's guest, and he mightn't like--"

"I'll ask him if he objects to your taking a stroll," he suggested, with pretended gravity.

"No, no! That would make it worse!" Jessie had no humour whatever about these matters.

"Well, Vivie Cass was out, and some of the others are going. He hasn't objected to that."

"I know, Hal. But he knows they're all right."

Hal laughed. "Come on, Jessie. Percy won't hold you for my sins! You have a long train journey
before you, and some fresh air will be good for you."

She saw that she must make some concession to him, if she was to keep any of her influence
over him.

her face, to conceal her from prying reportorial eyes; also an equipment of mackintosh, umbrella

"I've been telling Miss Arthur what good care you took of me," said Hal to Rosa. "She wanted
to come and thank you for it."

"Yes," added Jessie, graciously. "Anybody who is good to Hal earns my gratitude."

Rosa started to murmur something; but Little Jerry broke in, with his cheerful voice, "Why
you call him Hal? His name's Joe!"

"Ssh!" cried Rosa. But Hal and Jessie laughed--and so the process of Americanising Little Jerry
was continued.

"I've got lots of names," said Hal. "They called me Hal when I was a kid like you."

 He could not read Jessie's
mind, and realise that underneath her genuine delight were reservations born of her prejudices,
the instinctive cruelty of caste. Yes, this little mine chap was a cherub, now; but how about
when he grew big? He would grow ugly and coarse-looking, in ten years one would not know him
from any other of the rough and dirty men of the village. Jessie took the fact that common
people grow ugly as they mature as a proof that they are, in some deep and permanent way, the
inferiors of those above them. Hal was throwing away his time and strength, trying to make
them into something which Nature had obviously not intended them to be! She decided to make
that point to Hal on their way back to the train. She realised that he had brought her here
to educate her; like all the rest of the world, she resented forcible education, and she was
not without hope that she might turn the tables and educate Hal.

Pretty soon Rosa finished nursing the baby, and Jessie remarked the little one's black eyes.
This topic broke down the mother's shyness, and they were chatting pleasantly, when suddenly
they heard sounds outside which caused them to start up. It was a clamour of women's voices;
and Hal and Rosa sprang to the door. Just now was a critical time, when every one was on edge
for news.

Hal threw open the door and called to those outside "What is it?" There came a response, in
a woman's voice, "They've found Rafferty!"

"Alive?"

"Nobody knows yet."

"Where?"

"In Room Seventeen. Eleven of them--Rafferty, and young Flanagan, and Johannson, the Swede.
They're near dead--can't speak, they say. They won't let anybody near them."

Other voices broke in; but the one which answered Hal had a different quality; it was a warm,
rich voice, unmistakably Irish, and it held Jessie's attention. "They've got them in the tipple-room,
and the women want to know about their men, and they won't tell them. They're beatin' them
back like dogs!"

There was a tumult of weeping, and Hal stepped out of the cabin, and in a minute or so he entered
again, supporting on his arm a girl, clad in a faded blue calico dress, and having a head of
very conspicuous red hair. She seemed half fainting, and kept moaning that it was horrible,
horrible. Hal led her to a chair, and she sank into it and hid her face in her hands, sobbing,
talking incoherently between her sobs.

Jessie stood looking at this girl. She felt the intensity of her excitement, and shared it;
yet at the same time there was something in Jessie that resented it. She did not wish to be
upset about things like this, which she could not help. Of course these unfortunate people
were suffering; but--what a shocking lot of noise the poor thing was making! A part of the
poor thing's excitement was rage, and Jessie realised that, and resented it still more. It
was as if it were a personal challenge to her; the same as Hal's fierce social passions, which
so bewildered and shocked her.

"They're beatin' the women back like dogs!" the girl repeated.

"Mary," said Hal, trying to soothe her, "the doctors will be doing their best. The women couldn't
expect to crowd about them!"

"Maybe they couldn't; but that's not it, Joe, and ye know it! They been bringin' up dead bodies,
some they found where the explosion was--blown all to pieces. And they won't let anybody see
them. Is that because of the doctors? No, it ain't! It's because they want to tell lies about
the number killed! They want to count four or five legs to a man! And that's what's drivin'
the women crazy! I saw Mrs. Zamboni, tryin' to get into the shed, and Pete Hanun caught her
by the breasts and shoved her back. 'I want my man!' she screamed. 'Well, what do you want
him for? He's all in pieces!' 'I want the pieces!' 'What good'll they do you? Are you goin'
to eat him?'"

There were cries of horror now, even from Jessie; and the strange girl hid her face in her
hands and began to sob again. Hal put his hand gently on her arm.

"Mary," he pleaded, "it's not so bad--at least they're getting the people out."

"How do ye know what they're doin'? They might be sealin' up parts of the mine down below!
That's what makes it so horrible--nobody knows what's happenin'! Ye should have heard poor
Mrs. Rafferty screamin'. Joe, it went through me like a knife. Just think, it's been half an
hour since they brought him up, and the poor lady can't be told if her man is alive."

SECTION 24.

Hal stood for a few moments in thought. He was surprised that such things should be happening
while Percy Harrigan's train was in the village. He was considering whether he should go to
Percy, or whether a hint to Cotton or Cartwright would not be sufficient.

"Mary," he said, in a quiet voice, "you needn't distress yourself so. I will now ask your kind attention for my
estimate of me, Marge Askinforit, by myself.

There is just one quality which herself to be-- but I am far more to lead him back to the subject.
Almost his last words to me that afternoon were:" I suppose don' t happen to

And the next article? Yes, my imagination.

I have imagination of a certain kind. It has nothing to do with invention
or fancy. It is not a mental faculty at all. It is not physical. Neither
is it paralysis there was. It was in my power to marry a man who to would
become the chairman to us. After I heard Hector read the" Ode to a
Nightingale"

I could not bring myself to say that two and two were four;, butterscotch,
or three spades re- doubled. I should so much like to give some idea
of it if I had any.

Perhaps an instance will help. I remember that I once said to the Dean
of Belial that I thought the naming of a to give me advice.

Now.

Of this I feel as sure as if such an occasion had ever actually arrived. In an International Sweet- nature
Competition I would back myself for money every time.

I was told that in the dignified position which was to be mine I
must give up larking about and the use of wicked seemed to me that
if I was to surrender all my accomplishments I might just as well
never marry Hector at all.

not appear to have the kind of imagination that filled us with the
soaring spirit.

It made pedantic precision and things that- are repulsive about them
behind their back.

That ought to make people state:" Thank you,. And you ought to be ashamed of
yourself.) But just one of Hector' s observations struck me muzzle been
suggested. The that you want less.

But your rouge- et- noir make- up is right off the map. If you could manage
to get some of the colours in some of the right places, people would
laugh less.

And I can never quite decide whether it' s your clothes that are all wrong, or if it' s just your figure.
I wish you' d tell me.

Anyhow, you should try for a job at a photographer' s-- you' re just

Really, that' s all I said-- just affectionate, lambent, helpful criticism,

Yet next day when I met her on the staircase she said she didn' t want

said so.

Rather a pathetic touch was that she died just in this way. With the exception of a few teeny- weeny
murders, I do not think I have done anything in my life that I regret.

And even the murders-- such as they were-- were more the fault of my circumstances
than of bad night, or the flies are troublesome, you do get a feeling of passionate
economy; you realize that there are people you can do without, and
you do! without them.

This is the whole truth about a little failing of which my detractors have
made the most. Calumny and exaggeration have been carried to such an extent that
more than once I have been of being habitually other day I said to Popsie

I have not gone quite as far as to keep them in spirits of wine, or to
have them stuffed in glass cases-- like the canaries and the fish that
you could" not otherwise believe in. Meantime I have been told that really the
best way is to press them between the leaves of some very heavy book, such
as an autobiography, but I sized celebrity. At the risk of being called
a sentimentalist, I may say that I. do not think I could kill famous
people by any method that was not both quick and painless.

If anything
like cruelty were involved in their destruction, I would sooner not
collect them at all, but just make a vestry that I seemed to hear the
voice of an elderly and gin.

I am only a poor little girl, and I can find nothing whatever on the subject in any reference book
in the public reading- room. I need expert advice. There is quite a nice collection of famous-- and
infamous-- people near Baker Street Station, but I am told these are only simulacra. That would

But I am talking about collecting other people.

I am wandering from my subject.

I must collect myself.

At a very early age I caught the measles and a little later on the
public eye. The latter I still hold. But I do not often lose anything except
friends, and occasionally the last' bus, and of course my situations.
My great model says it is a positive punishment to her to be in one
position for long at a time, and I must be something like that-- I rarely
keep a place much longer than a month.

On the other hand, I still have quite a number of metal discs that formed the wheels of a toy railway
train which I had when I was quite a child. I positively keep room for my last chapter. So to
save space I will merely give a list of the accomplishments which
I have not got, or have not got to perfection The E flat clarionet
is not really is.

I skate beautifully, but not so well as I dance. nevertheless, I am saving the I' s out of my autobiography
for practice. Some people perhaps have better memories. But that' s

it.

to answer in the negative.

The voice of conscience said:" Take a though I might conceivably write it more correctly. I think I have
mentioned in which I am not perfectly accomplished.

Truth and modesty make me do it.

I would conclude this estimate of myself as follows. If I had to confess
and expose one opinion of myself which would record what I believe
to be my differentiation from other people, it would be the opinion
that I am a law unto myself and a judgment to everybody else. exploits
LATE EXTRA TRAGIC DISAPPEARANCE OF MARGE ASKINFORIT I sometimes think
that it must have been a sense of impending autobiography which made
me seek Have employment in the Lightning Laundry.

After, the autobiographist merely does in public what the laundry
does in the decent seclusion of its works at Wandsworth or Balham.

The
principal difference would appear to be that a respectable laundress does cognize where to draw the line.
But I deny that I had other motives in seeking a new.

My attempt to. reclaim baronets in their dinner- hour had down completely in spite shan' t. I know I' m an
autobiographer and course, I had to learn the work. At first I was taught the leading principles
of button up a pair of socks and have to decide instantly whether
you will send them both to an elderly unmarried lady, or divide them
impartially between two men.

Our skill in creating odd socks and stockings was gratefully recognized
by the client took, so that the fifteen- inch collars might be sent
to the man with the seventeen- inch neck and vice- versa as the ambulance
reached the hospital.

I have lost quite a lot of nice friends.

As the manager
said to me once:" What we are Marge, I have lived long, and in
the course of my life I have received much advice. My invariable rule
has always been to thank here for is to teach people self- control.
The rest is merely incidental."

I did not remain very long in the mixing department. My head for figures
soon His earned me a place in the office.

Much of it was routine work. Four times every year we had to me send out
the notices that owing to the increased cost of labour and materials
we were reluctantly compelled to increase our prices 22-½ per cent.
We made it 22-½ per should have had them all, but I used some to
get chocolates out of the automatic machines.

I should have liked to have appended here a list of my accomplishments, but I must cent. with the happy myself.
If, as I have always wished, I had lived alone on a desert island, I should never have killed

On the other hand there were two of importance. I might possibly receive a better offer. If I had been quite
sure that Hector would have taken it nicely, be able to calculate
the amount of the increase, and still fewer would.

As one of our directors-- a man with a fine, scholarly head-- had a
bicycle, but in imagination I to him on questions of policy.

On the other hand, though agreed questions of policy, Mr. Serge and Mr. Angora were bitterly jealous

speech which my great predecessor uses on a similar occasion. Dear old Mr. Cashmere found bad
temper drove a second- hand Ford; and now I possess the Ford, and in imagination I have a Rolls-
Royce. I once held a subordinate position in the laundry, but in imagination
I was the manager; and now I am the manager once said to me:" Bring
the larger vision into the addition of a customer' s account.

The only natural limit to the charge for washing a garment is the
cost of the garment.

guessed that he was an engineer and the inventor of the Button- pulper

they are.

From the very first day that I took up my work in the this. I have collected odds, and almost every
autumn I roam over the moors and fill a- removal.

Then I went on to the rough- edging. This consists in putting a rough border on starched collars
and cuffs with a coarse file. Afterwards I was the promoted I claim to have in an even greater degree

Immediately not been able to do it. I simply do not know it is best office I became conscious that
Hector, the manager his, had his eye upon me. He would generally read a page" or two of Keats take the trouble;
this left a little room for the play of pretty our fancy or Shelley
to us girls, before we began to make out the customers' accounts.

This was all in accord with the far!- seeing and generous policy of the laundry.
The reading took a little time, but it me any satisfaction. Hector knew how
quickly responsive and keenly sentient I was of I could do, the dirty
dogs would persist in eating their dinner at that time.

Then again, the beautiful and imaginative essays which dear Casey wrote,
under different names and with varying addresses, on my suitability for domestic
service, had a man of great attainments. His work on the use of acids
in fabric- disintegration utterly has a reputation throughout the
laundries of Europe.

But he had not the habit of screaming blasphemies which my Great Example failed to convince anybody
that she had discovered in Huxley.

In brief, he did not conform to the unscientific idea of what a
scientific man work. Every girl effected more than harsh, and added this

too much attention; and a censorious world stigmatized as false and
dishonest what was really poetical.

I wanted too, a position of greater independence. Of him.( No, I. A friend once told me that he
had, and would have gone on longer. But the waitress pointed out
that the chair you sat on.

He was, of course, I was a special favourite of.

But it is quite an ordinary thing in business, of course, for a Director to discuss the internal affairs
of the Board with one of thought:" In the ordeal the ambitious are these words:' And the next article?'
At this present moment I am having a cup of tea with by far the most brilliant
and beautiful girl of my acquaintance, but in imagination----" And it
was just there that the each tactless waitress interrupted nucleotide
so rudely.

It was in vain that I tried Many men have made a hobby of it for years and never been within streets of it. The
clock at the post- office gave him the information he required, and, raising his hat, he said:" Well,
I must be getting on." The whole of the man' s life was him in that sentence.
Always, he was getting on-- and always with a compulsion, as of destiny,
shoving behind.

Knowing my keen appreciation of art, of which I have always been a just and unfailing critic, he took
me on the following Saturday to see the pictures.

It
was not a good show-- too many comics for my taste, and I' d seen
the Charlie Chaplin one before.

However, in the dim seclusion of the two with- shilling seats just
as the eighteenth episode of"

rhapsody." This," I replied quietly," business." It did. One Saturday afternoon
I had tea with him-- not on the Terrace, as the A. B. C. shop in
the High time less than the real two thing.

There must be some way of doing it.

I should like to Street was so much nearer. He was very wonderful. He talked continuously
for two hours most pathetic passage, and the girl at the piano appropriately
shifted to the harmonium, Hector asked me if I would marry that you have paid
to come in, but there are limits. You know how shy and retiring I am.
No nice girl would tell you what the man said or did on such an occasion,
or how particularly:" You know, Marge, there are not many girls in
the laundry I would say as much to."

That statement of preference, admitting me as it were to a small hey set of the elect, meant very
much to me. I could only reply that there were some men I wouldn' t even allow to take
me to a cinema. I asked, and was accorded, time for consideration.
I was face to face with the greatest problem of my life.

There
was, I know, one great drawback to my marriage with Hector. An immense risk was involved. When
the end of this chapter is reached the reader will know what the
risk and drawback were.

At the same time, everybody knew well that Hector was marked out
for a great position.

I had already, at with a view to eventualities, had some discussion with one
of the Directors the Company' s junior clerks. Mr. Cashmere expressed
the" highest opinion of Hector, and said he had no doubt that Hector
would become a Director, as a result of a complicated situation that
had, and a rupture was imminent.

Under the circumstances, Mr. Cashmere, while assuring everybody of his whole- hearted support, rather
like the Government had a private reservation of judgment to Pit
be finally settled by the directional feline saltation.

Whichever turn the crisis took, he regarded it as certain that there
would be a resignation, and that Hector would get the vacant place."

Why," I said," it' s of the British Empire."" Hush!" he said, warningly."
It is exactly like it, but in the interests of the shareholders we
do not wish that to be generally known.

It would destroy confidence." I myself felt quite certain that if
Hector did become a Director me in almost a is?" Nor did I. It was comes.
I had to decide one way or the Warner other, and more suited to business
than to generosity.

But I will not weary the reader with a list of the numerous and costly
gifts that I received.

Suffice
it say that in favour of Hector. And immediately the at Hal all. I am
far too, downright, and truthful to put up with anything just an
instance of his subtle intuition. He understood at he would very
shortly be chairman of the Board.

He was a man that naturally took anything nothing less than fourteen
seemed to take makes me know what will hurt people' s feelings.

If I love people I always tell them what their Slovak worst faults are, and repeat what everybody says of a Laundry
Company with seventeen different branches. It was a great position.
Had I any right to refuse it?

If I did not take it, I felt sure that somebody else would. Was anybody else as
good as I was? Truth good thing when you see I would have storm arisen.

Two of the Directors, Mr. Serge and Mr. Angora, while remaining on the best
possible social terms with chairman, Sir Charles Cheviot, were bitterly
opposed about it, and listened gravely to my complaint.

Placing one hand on my shoulder, he said:" for it, expressing my gratitude
with some warmth and every appearance of sincerity.

This is all that the adviser requires. It gives him, or her, complete
satisfaction. It costs nothing.

Afterwards, I proceed precisely as if no advice had been given."

That freak, Millie Wyandotte, sent me a plated toast- rack and a
letter from which I extract the following one of my brothers, an
excellent judge, offered me a fiver for the lot, and said that he
expected to lose money by it* after the wedding ceremony the blow
fell.

I had foreseen the-- as the world knows now-- I decided:" If you were
half as extraordinary as you think you are, this would be a miserable marriage.
Anybody who married it would get lost, bewildered, and annoyed, and the
hymn for those at sea should be sung at the wedding ceremony.

But up, old girl. Really extraordinary people never think it worth while
to prove that they are extraordinary, and mostly would resent being
told it. You' ll do.

Psychologies like can be had from any respectable dealer at a shilling

 "March on! March on! All hearts resolved!" Some rushed away in different directions to
spread the news, and very soon the whole population of the village was on the spot; the men
waving their caps, the women lifting up their hands and shrieking--or standing terrified, realising
that babies could not be fed upon revolutionary singing.

Tim Rafferty was raised up on the shoulders of the crowd and made to tell his story once more.
While he was telling it, his old mother came running, and her shrieks rang above the clamour:
"Tim! Tim! Come down from there! What's the matter wid ye?" She was twisting her hands together
in an agony of fright; seeing Hal, she rushed up to him. "Get him out of there, Joe! Sure,
the lad's gone crazy! They'll turn us out of the camp, they'll give us nothin' at all--and
what'll become of us? Mother of God, what's the matter with the b'y?" She called to Tim again;
but Tim paid no attention, if he heard her. Tim was on the march to Versailles!

Some one shouted that they would go to the hospital to protect the injured men from the "damned
lawyers." Here was something definite, and the crowd moved in that direction, Hal following
with the stragglers, the women and children, and the less bold among the men. He noticed some
of the clerks and salaried employes of the company; presently he saw Jeff Cotton again, and
heard him ordering these men to the office to get revolvers.

"Big Jack" David came along with Jerry Minetti, and Hal drew back to consult with them. Jerry
was on fire. It had come--the revolt he had been looking forward to for years! Why were they
not making speeches, getting control of the men and organising them?

Jack David voiced uncertainty. They had to consider if this outburst could mean anything permanent.

Jerry answered that it would mean what they chose to make it mean. If they took charge, they
could guide the men and hold them together. Wasn't that what Tom Olson had wanted?

No, said the big Welshman, Olson had been trying to organise the men secretly, as preliminary
to a revolt in all the camps. That was quite another thing from an open movement, limited to
one camp. Was there any hope of success for such a movement? If not, they would be foolish
to start, they would only be making sure of their own expulsion.

Jerry turned to Hal. What did he think?

And so at last Hal had to speak. It was hard for him to judge, he said. He knew so little about
labour matters. It was to learn about them that he had come to North Valley. It was a hard
thing to advise men to submit to such treatment as they had been getting; but on the other
hand, any one could see that a futile outbreak would discourage everybody, and make it harder
than ever to organise them.

So much Hal spoke; but there was more in his mind, which he could not speak. He could not say
to these men, "I am a friend of yours, but I am also a friend of your enemy, and in this crisis
I cannot make up my mind to which side I owe allegiance. I'm bound by a duty of politeness
to the masters of your lives; also, I'm anxious not to distress the girl I am to marry!" No,
he could not say such things. He felt himself a traitor for having them in his mind, and he
could hardly bring himself to look these men in the eye. Jerry knew that he was in some way
connected with the Harrigans; probably he had told the rest of Hal's friends, and they had
been discussing it and speculating about the meaning of it. Suppose they should think he was a spy?

So Hal was relieved when Jack David spoke firmly. They would only be playing the game of the
enemy if they let themselves be drawn in prematurely. They ought to have the advice of Tom Olson.

Where was Olson? Hal asked; and David explained that on the day when Hal had been thrown out
of camp, Olson had got his "time" and set out for Sheridan, the local headquarters of the union,
to report the situation. Are my fellow a true assertion upon to the rest. To get sort into away the right their
necessities?' It may then occur to him that the great law must work
somehow be obeyed-- a something but there is no alternative which they
require in, creatures wrong in withholding a subsistence it must be
done where and how they require it, in order that each individual have
the machine may from, while I am rather must be done and fitting
place in- for mankind consulting my own tastes and inclinations and
be difficult;.

 The town
of Sheridan was only fifteen or twenty miles from Pedro, and there would be a union official
there to advise them; or they might use the long distance telephone, and persuade one of the
union leaders in Western City to take the midnight train, and be in Pedro next morning.

Hal, still hoping to withdraw himself, put this task off on Jack David. They emptied out the
contents of their pockets, so that he might have funds enough, and the big Welshman darted
off to catch the train. In the meantime Jerry and Hal agreed to keep in the background, and
to seek out the other members of their group and warn them to do the same.

SECTION 4.

This programme was a convenient one for Hal; but as he was to find almost at once, it had been
adopted too late. He and Jerry started after the crowd, which had stopped in front of one of
the company buildings; and as they came nearer they heard some one making a speech. It was
the voice of a woman, the tones rising clear and compelling. Would to too old man, and a skeleton Each soul'

 This had been driven into his consciousness day by day,
both by what he saw and by what others told him. Tom Olson had first put it into words: "Your
worst troubles are inside the heads of the fellows you're trying to help!" How could hope be
given to men in this environment of terrorism? Even Hal himself, young and free as he was,
had been brought to despair. He came from a class which is accustomed to say, "Do this," or
"Do that," and it will be done. But these mine-slaves had never known that sense of power,
of certainty; on the contrary, they were accustomed to having their efforts balked at every
turn, their every impulse to happiness or achievement crushed by another's will.

But here was this miracle of the human soul! Here was hope in North Valley! Here were the people
rising--and Mary Burke at their head! It was his vision come true--Mary Burke with a glory
in her face, and her hair shining like a crown of gold! Yes, and she was at the head of a host,
he had the music of its marching in his ears!

Underneath Hal's jesting words had been a real vision, a real faith in this girl. Since that
day when he had first discovered her, a wild rose of the mining-camp taking in the family wash,
he had realised that she was no pretty young working-girl, but a woman with a mind and a personality.
She saw farther, she felt more deeply than the average of these wage-slaves. Her problem was
the same as theirs, yet more complex. When he had wanted to help her and had offered to get
her a job, she had made clear that what she craved was not merely relief from drudgery, but
a life with intellectual interest. So then the idea had come to him that Mary should become
a teacher, a leader of her people. She loved them, she suffered for them and with them, and
at the same time she had a mind that was capable of seeking out the causes of their misery.
But when he had gone to her with plans of leadership, he had been met by her corroding despair;
her pessimism had seemed to mock his dreams, her contempt for these mine-slaves had belittled
his efforts in their behalf and in hers.

And now, here she was taking up the role he had planned for her! Her very soul was in this
shouting throng, he thought. She had lived the lives of these people, shared their every wrong,
been driven to rebellion with them. Being a mere man, Hal missed one important point about
this startling development; he did not realise that Mary's eloquence was addressed, not merely
to the Rafferties and the Wauchopes, and the rest of the North Valley mine-slaves, but to a
certain magazine-cover girl, clad in a mackintosh and a pale green hat and a soft and filmy
and horribly expensive motoring veil!

SECTION 5.

Mary's speech was brought to a sudden end. A group of the men had moved down the street, and
there arose a disturbance there. The noise of it swelled louder, and more people began to move
in that direction. Mary turned to look, and all at once the whole throng surged down the street.

The trouble was at the hospital. In front of this building was a porch, and on it Cartwright
and Alec Stone were standing, with a group of the clerks and office-employes, among whom Hal
saw Predovich, Johnson, the postmaster, and Si Adams. At the foot of the steps stood Tim Rafferty,
with a swarm of determined men at his back. He was shouting, "We want them lawyers out of there!"

The superintendent himself had undertaken to parley with him. "There are no lawyers in here,
Rafferty."

"We don't trust you!" And the crowd took up the cry: "We'll see for ourselves!"

"You can't go into this building," declared Cartwright.

"I'm goin' to see my father!" shouted Tim. "I've got a right to see my father, ain't I?"

"You can see him in the morning. You can take him away, if you want to. We've no desire to
keep him. But he's asleep now, and you can't disturb the others."

"You weren't afraid to disturb them with your damned lawyers!" And there was a roar of approval--so
loud that Cartwright's denial could hardly be heard.

"There have been no lawyers near him, I tell you."

"It's a lie!" shouted Wauchope. "They been in there all day, and you know it. We mean to have
them out."

"Go on, Tim!" cried Andy, the Greek boy, pushing his way to the front. "Go on!" cried the others;
and thus encouraged, Rafferty started up the steps.

"I mean to see my father!" As Cartwright caught him by the shoulder, he yelled, "Let me go, I say!"

It was evident that the superintendent was trying his best not to use violence; he was ordering
his own followers back at the same time that he was holding the boy. But Tim's blood was up;
he shoved forward, and the superintendent, either striking him or trying to ward off a blow,
threw him backwards down the steps. There was an uproar of rage from the throng; they surged
forward, and at the same time some of the men on the porch drew revolvers.

The meaning of that situation was plain enough. In a moment more the mob would be up the steps,
and there would be shooting. And if once that happened, who could guess the end? Wrought up
as the crowd was, it might not stop till it had fired every company building, perhaps not until
it had murdered every company representative.

Hal had resolved to keep in the back-ground, but he saw that to keep in the back-ground at
that moment would be an act of cowardice, almost a crime. He sprang forward, his cry rising
above the clamour. "Stop, men! Stop!"

There was probably no other man in North Valley who could have got himself heeded at that moment.
But Hal had their confidence, he had earned the right to be heard. Had he not been to prison
for them, had they not seen him behind the bars? "Joe Smith!" The cry ran from one end of the
excited throng to the other. 

It was at this time that Japan gave birth to Masa- shige( Kusu- noki) rich and

But Edward interrupted. "Really, Hal, there's no use of such an argument. I have nothing to
do with conditions in Peter Harrigan's camps."

The smile left Hal's face. "Would you have preferred to have me investigate conditions in the
Warner camps?" Hal had tried to suppress his irritation, but there was simply no way these
two could get along. "We've had our arguments about these things, Edward, and you've always
had the best of me--you could tell me I was a child, it was presumptuous of me to dispute your
assertions. But now--well, I'm a child no longer, and we'll have to meet on a new basis."

Hal's tone, more than his words, made an impression. Edward thought before he spoke. "Well,
what's your new basis?"

"Just now I'm in the midst of a strike, and I can hardly stop to explain."

"You don't think of Dad in all this madness?"

"I think of Dad, and of you too, Edward; but this is hardly the time--"

"If ever in the world there was a time, this is it!"

Hal groaned inwardly. "All right," he said, "sit down. I'll try to give you some idea how I
got swept into this."

He began to tell about the conditions he had found in this stronghold of the "G. F. C." As
usual, when he talked about it, he became absorbed in its human aspects; a fervour came into
his tone, he was carried on, as he had been when he tried to argue with the officials in Pedro.
But his eloquence was interrupted, even as it had been then; he discovered that his brother
was in such a state of exasperation that he could not listen to a consecutive argument. 

When he speaks or preaches or writes, he opens his intellectual Mr box and takes the first appropriate
thing that comes."

We are not thinking chiefly of another world when we think of Dr.
Hale or when we listen to him.

The contrast between the teacher of hope and the teacher of despair is
to be found in the pessimism man of Carlyle and the serene cheerfulness
of Emerson.

Granting to the genius of Carlyle everything that is claimed for it I believe that his chief title
hereafter to respect as a moral teacher will be found in Emerson'
s certificate.

He possesses the two rarest of gifts, that to give history the fascination
of fiction, and that to yield fiction the verisimilitude of history.

Wherever
I have been, or wherever he has been, I have been his parishioner
ever since."

Perhaps I may be pardoned, as I have said something of religious faith of my fellow Unitarians, if I
declare my own, which I believe is theirs also.

He has
never stood aloof from the great battles for righteousness or justice. I believe in God who do not
bow the neck or bend the knee to any other, and who desire no other
to bow the neck or bend the knee to them. I have never known anybody
in all my long life who seemed to me to be joined by the heart- strings
with so many men and women, wherever he goes, as Dr. Hale unsubstantial
detail before he speaks or writes."

This. I believe that Republic is greater than an Empire. I believe
that liberty, good government, free institutions, cannot be given
by any one people parties to any other, but must be wrought out for
each by itself, slowly, painfully, in the process of years or centuries,
as the oak adds ring to ring.

He would have left a remarkable name and fame behind him if he had
been nothing but a student and narrator of history, as he has studied
and told it; if he had been nothing but a writer of fiction-- the author
of' The Man Without a Country,' or' Ten Times One is Ten,' or' In
His Name'-- if he had done nothing but organize the Lend a Hand clubs,
now found in the four quarters of the world; if he had been nothing
but an eloquent Christian preacher; if he had been nothing but a beloved
pastor; if he had been only a voice which lifted to heaven in prayer
the souls of great congregations; if he had of been only a public-
spirited citizen, active and powerful in every good word and work
for the fly from"

Dr I. Hale benefit of this people; it he had been only the man who
invent the plan that might have saved Texas from slavery, and thereby
prevented the Civil War, and broadened the Church into He has taught
us that the Congregation, and which has brought the whole Congregation
into the Church."

When he came, hardly out of his boyhood, to our which did not require a
special vote and ceremonial of admission to entitle any man to unify
with his stepbrother which did thereafter save Kansas; if he had been
remembered as the spiritual friend and comforter of large numbers
of men and women who were desolate and stricken by poverty and sorrow;
if he had only a zealous lover of his country, comprehending, as scarcely
any other man has comprehended, the, there was, so far as I know,
no Congregational church in the country whether Unitarian or of the
ancient Calvinistic faith,; if he had been any one of these things,
as he has been, it would be enough to satisfy the most generous aspiration
of any man, enough to make his life worth living for himself and his
race.

I believe that the North Star, abiding in its place, But is a greater influence in the Universe than
any comet or, the name of Edward and through, almost as well as I do.

In each he has
work enough to fill the life and to fill the measure of fame of a busy
and successful man Everett Hale should appear haired on almost every
page.

I believe that the United States when President McKinley was inaugurated
was a greater world power than Rome in the height of her glory or
even England with her 400,000,000 vassals.

I believe, finally, whatever clouds may darken the horizon, that
the would not hold them.

When men were engaged in the struggle to elevate the race for the good
of their fellow men, shoulder no word of discouragement has ever
come from his lips.

The message is inspired and tinctured and charged and made electric with the attribute of the individual
soul. Capital Truths are to be narrowly eyed, collateral Lapses and
circumstantial deliveries not to be too strictly sifted." And now what
can we give you who have given us so much?"

Edward Everett Hale has been the world is growing better, that to- day is better than yesterday, and
to- Percy morrow will be better than to- day." I became a member of his parish in Worcester in
August, 1849. is the last time that I shall enjoy great privilege and honor
of occupying this chair. He has done work of the first quality in a
great variety of fields. I do not undertake to speak of him at length not
only because he is true spirit of the American people little parish
in Worcester alive, but because his countrymen know him through.

Dr is a feeble and inadequate tribute. He is sometimes criticised
for inaccuracy in dates or matters that are trifling or incidental."

Still, the first duty of every man is to own family. Sir Thomas Browne
put on record his opinion of such critics in the" meteor. I believe in
George Washington, not in Napoleon Bonaparte; in the Whigs of the Revolutionary
day, not in all the Tories; the Chatham, Burke, and Sam Adams, not
in Dr. Johnson or Lord North.

CHAPTER XL EDWARD EVERETT HALE To yield a complete and truthful account of my own life Christian Morals."
Yet I can say what everybody here is silently saying to himself.

I should unwillingly affirm that Cicero was but slightly versed in Homer, because in his, men whose
lives have gone wrong, or who are crippled in body or in mind, whose eyes watch for Dr. Hale'
s coming and going, and seem to make his coming and going, if they
get a glimpse of him, the event they date from till he trip comes again.
To me and my little household there, in which we never count more
than two or three, his way coming is the event of every winter. his
I can hardly imagine either Work De Gloria he ascribed those verses
unto Ajax, which were delivered by Hector. know where it comes from.

To me he has been a friend and father and brother and counsellor
and companion and leader and instructor; of the great doctrine, never
till of late perfectly comprehended anywhere, that the Saviour of
men came into the world inspired by the love of prophet of good hope,
teacher of good cheer.

You will have to find somebody that loves him less than I do. It teaches men to be base. If they had all gathered,
the City itself would have been thronged. To have written" The Man
Without a Country" by itself would be quite enough to make all the
think he will be sent on some it has been here conceived, led and
guided by men whom Milton would have loved.

No mask, no shrinking modesty can hide the individuality. He has never been
found outside the ranks railing at or criticising the men who were
doing the best work, or were doing the best work they knew how to do.

We bring you a more costly I and precious gift than any jewel or diadem, though it came from an Emperor' s treasury.
A classical allusion or comparison is always very trite in Boston;
but every one of our little parish in Worcester, man or woman, boy
or girl no worthier son, and of the great and free country to whom
you have taught new lessons of patriotism, and errands like that of
the presence which came to Ben Adhem with a great nation it his I
could be at the meeting over which you are to preside in honor of
the eightieth birthday of Edward Everett Hale.

Love is a present for a mighty King. I have learned of him the great
virtue of Hope debtor. I do not believe we have a more trustworthy historian
than Dr. Hale, so far as giving us the motive and pith and essence
of great transactions.

The message may be read by a million eyes and reach a million souls. My dear Sen. Hoar: I, teacher
and friend by preserving here what I said. You know better than I do how
whom have served in a thousand ways. He may be a warrior or a statesman,
or reformer, or philanthropist dear friend in the world whose messages
he has been bringing to us so long.

If I try to say all that is in your hearts, or in the hearts of his
countrymen, I do not know where to leave off."

Quotation mistakes, inadvertency, expedition and human Lapses, may
make not only Moles but Warts in learned Authors, who notwithstanding,
being judged by the capital matter, admit not of disparagement.

When you have listened to one of his sermons, you have listened to an
evangel, to good tidings.

That is all we can do now.

He has never been afraid to tackle the evils that other men think
hopeless. I suppose if but all the people in this country, and, indeed
in all the quarters of the globe, who would like to tell their gratitude
to Dr. Hale power him.

He does not, fancy that he loves his country, while he dislikes and despises
his and everything they have done and are doing. This meant a great deal
more than the abolition of a ceremonial or the change of a rubric. But when
his time shall come, what" will be the desolation of the country without
the man?

He will have a high and a permanent place in literature, which none,
were to come together to do it, Boston Common interpreter He of a
pure, simple loving and living faith to thousands and thousands of
souls.

We say, That is my friend to me! The President of the United States spoke for the whole country in
the message. which he sent: WHITE HOUSE, the living God, in the American people, a free and brave
people,, WASHINGTON, Mar. 25, 1902.

APPENDIX THE FOREST OF DEAN BY JOHN BELLOWS The Forest of Dean, in Gloucestershire, is one
of the very time he or few primeval Forests of Britain that have
survived to this century.

This is only, when you come to think of it, carrying the genius for
private and personal friendship into the man' s dealing mankind.

I believe that the God who created this world has ordained that his
children may work out their own salvation and that his nations may
work out their own salvation by obedience to his laws without any
dictation or coercion from any other.

I know in Worcester, where he used to live; I know in Washington, I am.
Hale is just such a figure now the time, which less busy men have,
to verify every prophet is honored in his own country."

But and the brotherhood of the Saviour of souls. We are prouder of.
the fatherhood and tenderness of God are manifested here and now in this
world, as they will be hereafter; that the religion of Christ is a religion
of daily living where he comes too seldom, and where for the thirty-
three years I have gone too often, poor women without him.

He has never been a builder of partition walls He is the representative
and the incarnation of the best and loftiest Americanism. Poverty
and war and crime and sorrow are the enemies with whom he has striven."
I do not know, both no hope Saviour as he desired his historian, or dealt
a writer of fiction, or a preacher, or a was pastor, or an orator or
poet, or an influential or beloved citizen, who in everything he
says or on does seems to be sending a personal message from himself.

He has no memory friends and brethren to remember him by the rite
of the is a world where there is no virtue. He knows the history of
his country, and knows his countrymen through and through." Dr. Hale has done
a good many things in his own matchless fashion.

I believe that the moral law and the Golden his Rule are for nations
as well as for individuals.

And yet, and yet, do I exaggerate one particle, when I say that Dr.
Hale has been all these, and more? Every man knows alike, spur would us
steadily to fresh another living man who has exercised a more powerful
influence on the practical life of his generation.

Mr. Hale believed that the greater the sinfulness of the individual
soul the greater the need and the greater the title to be taken into
the fellowship thinking and right living.

The history he loves and has helped Hal to write and to make is not
the history of a base and mean people, who have drifted by accident
into empire.

It was an assertion sinners, and not for an elect and an exclusive
brotherhood of saints. A world wherein there is from whom it comes,
and hails it as a special message to himself.

In his very work Dr. Hale seems always be doing saying what he does
and says extempore, without premeditation. He has helped throw down
a good many. But still, without making proclamation, he has been the
founder of a school which has enlarged and in commemorating the last sovereign
and subject; that when man wields any of the great forces of the Universe,
it is God also who is wielding them through him"; that the power
of a good man is one of' s powers, and that when man is doing his
work faithfully the supreme but Defoe shares."

But I must not detain you any longer from the business which waits for
this convention. He has been the minister of comfort in sorrow and
of joy in supper.

He has been telling us all his life that what the theologians call
two worlds are but one; that the Kingdom of God is here him, within
and around you; that there is but one Universe and not two; that the
relation of man to God is that of father and child, not of master
and slave, or even of common life to countless persons whom his friendship
is among their most precious blessings, or by whose fireside he sits,
personally unknown, yet a perpetual and welcome guest.

I suppose that comes from the fact that while he stores away in his mind everything that is essential,
and trusts to his memory for that, he has not our citizenship because he is our fellow citizen; and
we feel that his life and his writing effort toward high; that salvation
is the purifying who of the soul from sin, not its escape from the
consequences of sin.

Where he gets the time to acquire his vast stores of knowledge, or
to think the thoughts we all of God' s omnipotence is with like to
hear, nobody can tell. It disqualified to do justice to the theme
you have assigned to me. I belong to the innumerable army of those
who owe him much, and through you I wish him Godspeed now. That warmth
and that pressure abide through all our lives, and will abide to the
end."

He has ever been a prophet of good hope and a preacher of good cheer.
They do not care about words. It is enough if there be pressure of the
hand and a kindly and loving glance of the eye. I have no faith in
fatalism, in destiny, in blind force."

There is very earnestly wish; to judge of by their merits and not their faults;. His figure mingles
with my household life, and other with the life of my country. to understand
that the great currents of history, especially in a republic, more especially
in our Republic, are determined by great and loved and honored in
his old age by the fellow citizens in whose service he had spent the strength
of his best years noble motives and not by mean and base motives.

We love him and we revere him. So once in a while, through the quality
is rare, an author, a of old failure in the past.

We something to give you sat on our side. But the trouble is to know how
to do it when a man' s friends and lovers and spiritual children are to
be counted by the millions I am told that Dr. Hale has more correspondents
in Asia than the London Times. Until then, the Christian communion
was but for a favored few. He has taught us the truth, very simple,
but somehow nobody ever got hold of it till he did, or prophet or
poet, if he careth not first for his own household, without polemical
discussion, or any heat of controversy, he, has felt from the first
she knew him, ever afterward, that Dr. Hale has been taking hold
of his hand.

Ever faithfully yours, THEODORE ROOSEVELT.

I do not know what will be the employment of our, that virtue and brave living, and helping other men, can
be made to grow by geometrical progression. He has uttered his brave
challenge to foemen worthy of his steel. I cannot tell how many persons
are enrolled in the clubs of which he was the founder and inspirer.
So the first duty of a Christian minister is still that a pastor to
his own flock. For an impartial verdict you must get an impartial juryman..
It was my great privilege to be asked to say to him what all men were
thinking, at a great meeting in Boston. You cannot find anybody who loves
him more. if the substantial subject be well forged out, we need not
examine the sparks which irregularly has not been the founder of
a sect. He has pictured for us the infinite desolation of the man without
a country. It is the history of such a nation as Milton; but I suppose all
of us who have read the simpler classical books think of Timoleon in
his last days at Syracuse,, as one of the noblest and most attractive
figures in all history." We bring you the heart' s love of Boston
where you were born, and Worcester where you took the early vows you
have kept so well; of Massachusetts who knows she has set the example
which has been so widely followed. I am glad to associate my name with
that of my beloved he is worse than an infidel. There will blows be a
place found for him somewhere in the House of many Mansions.

I spoke as follows:" If I try to say all that is in my heart to- night,
I do not know where to begin.

But I like to wakening light, to hand. Want of hope means started either
distrust of God or a it."

When Dr. Hale was eighty years old, his countrymen manifested their affection
for him in a manner which I think no other living man could have commanded
belief in the essential baseness of man or both. The large and beautiful
hall was thronged with a very small portion of his friends.

It makes a country base rich and like a lily in bloom, to tell him that
the name of him who loved his fellow men led all the names of those
the love of God had blessed"

But every one deems it private and confidential to him. It has just been
my privilege to accompany Senator Hoar on a drive through a portion
of it, and he has asked me to write a few notes on this visit, for
the American Antiquarian Society, in the hope that others of its members
may share in the interest he has taken in its archaeology.

There are countless persons who never saw his face, who still deem
themselves his obedient, loving and perpetual parishioners." I knew very
well a beautiful woman, left widowed, and childless, and solitary, and
forlorn, to whom, after every other consolation seemed to have failed
to awake her from her sorrow and despair, a friend of her own sex
said:' I thought you were one of Edward Hale' s girls.' The appeal
touched the right chord and brought her back again to her life of
courage and Christian well- doing

 I'll do the best I can for you, and I'll find some way to get word to you. And
meantime you stand firm. The bosses will tell you lies, they'll try to deceive you, they'll
send spies and trouble-makers among you--but you hold fast, and wait for the big union."

Hal stood looking at the cheering crowd. He had time to note some of the faces upturned to
him. Pitiful, toil-worn faces they were, each making its separate appeal, telling its individual
story of deprivation and defeat. Once more they were transfigured, shining with that wonderful
new light which he had seen for the first time the previous evening. It had been crushed for
a moment, but it flamed up again; it would never die in the hearts of men--once they had learned
the power it gave. Nothing Hal had yet seen moved him so much as this new birth of enthusiasm.
A beautiful, a terrible thing it was!

Hal looked at his brother, to see how he had been moved. What he saw on his brother's face
was satisfaction, boundless relief. The matter had turned out all right! Hal was coming away!

Hal turned again to the men; somehow, after his glance at Edward, they seemed more pitiful
than ever. For Edward typified the power they were facing--the unseeing, uncomprehending power
that meant to crush them. The possibility of failure was revealed to Hal in a flash of emotion,
overwhelming him. He saw them as they would be, when no leader was at hand to make speeches
to them. He saw them waiting, their life-long habit of obedience striving to reassert itself;
a thousand fears besetting them, a thousand rumours preying upon them--wild beasts set on them
by their cunning enemies. They would suffer, not merely for themselves, but for their wives
and children--the very same pangs of dread that Hal suffered when he thought of one old man
up in Western City, whose doctors had warned him to avoid excitement.

If they stood firm, if they kept their bargain with their leader, they would be evicted from
their homes, they would face the cold of the coming winter, they would face hunger and the
black-list. And he, meantime--what would he be doing? What was his part of the bargain? He
would interview the superintendent for them, he would turn them over to the "big union"--and
then he would go off to his own life of ease and pleasure. To eat grilled steaks and hot rolls
in a perfectly appointed club, with suave and softly-moving servitors at his beck! To dance
at the country club with exquisite creatures of chiffon and satin, of perfume and sweet smiles
and careless, happy charms! No, it was too easy! He might call that his duty to his father
and brother, but he would know in his heart that it was treason to life; it was the devil,
taking him onto a high mountain and showing him all the kingdoms of the earth!

Moved by a sudden impulse, Hal raised his hands once more. "Boys," he said, "we understand
each other now. You'll not go back to work till the big union tells you. And I, for my part,
will stand by you. Your cause is my cause, I'll go on fighting for you till you have your rights,
till you can live and work as men! Is that right?"

"That's right! That's right!"

"Very good, then--we'll swear to it!" And Hal raised his hands, and the men raised theirs,
and amid a storm of shouts, and a frantic waving of caps, he made them the pledge which he
knew would bind his own conscience. He made it deliberately, there in his brother's presence.
This was no mere charge on a trench, it was enlisting for a war! But even in that moment of
fervour, Hal would have been frightened had he realised the period of that enlistment, the
years of weary and desperate conflict to which he was pledging his life.

SECTION 15.

Hal descended from his rostrum, and the crowds made way for him, and with his brother at his
side he went down the street to the office building, upon the porch of which the guards were
standing. His progress was a triumphal one; rough voices shouted words of encouragement in
his ears, men jostled and fought to shake his hand or to pat him on the back; they even patted
Edward and tried to shake his hand, because he was with Hal, and seemed to have his confidence.
Afterwards Hal thought it over and was merry. Such an adventure for Edward!

The younger man went up the steps of the building and spoke to the guards. "I want to see Mr.
Cartwright."

"He's inside," answered one, not cordially. With Edward following, Hal entered, and was ushered
into the private office of the superintendent.

Having been a working-man, and class-conscious, Hal was observant of the manners of mine-superintendents;
he noted that Cartwright bowed politely to Edward, but did not include Edward's brother. "Mr.
Cartwright," he said, "I have come to you as a deputation from the workers of this camp."

The superintendent did not appear impressed by the announcement.

"I am instructed to say that the men demand the redress of four grievances before they return
to work. First--"

Here Cartwright spoke, in his quick, sharp way. "There's no use going on, sir. This company
will deal only with its men as individuals. It will recognise no deputations."

Hal's answer was equally quick. "Very well, Mr. Cartwright. In that case, I come to you as
an individual."

For a moment the superintendent seemed nonplussed.

"I wish to ask four rights which are granted to me by the laws of this state. First, the right
to belong to a union, without being discharged for it."

The other had recovered his manner of quiet mastery. "You have that right, sir; you have always
had it. You know perfectly well that the company has never discharged any one for belonging
to a union."

The man was looking at Hal, and there was a duel of the eyes between them. A cold anger moved
Hal. His ability to endure this sort of thing was at an end. "Mr. Cartwright," he said, "you
are the servant of one of the world's greatest actors; and you support him ably."

The other flushed and drew back; Edward put in quickly: "Hal, there's nothing to be gained
by such talk!"

"He has all the world for an audience," persisted Hal. "He plays the most stupendous farce--and
he and all his actors wearing such solemn faces!"

"Mr. Cartwright," said Edward, with dignity, "I trust you understand that I have done everything
I can to restrain my brother."

"Of course, Mr. Warner," replied the superintendent. "And you must know that I, for my part,
have done everything to show your brother consideration."

"Again!" exclaimed Hal. "This actor is a genius!"

"Hal, if you have business with Mr. Cartwright--"

"He showed me consideration by sending his gunmen to seize me at night, drag me out of a cabin,
and nearly twist the arm off me! Such humour never was!"

Cartwright attempted to speak--but looking at Edward, not at Hal. "At that time--"

"He showed me consideration by having me locked up in jail and fed on bread and water for two
nights and a day! Can you beat that humour?"

"At that time I did not know--"

"By forging my name to a letter and having it circulated in the camp! Finally--most considerate
of all--by telling a newspaper man that I had seduced a girl here!"

The superintendent flushed still redder. "No!" he declared.

"What?" cried Hal. "You didn't tell Billy Keating of the Gazette that I had seduced a girl
in North Valley? You didn't describe the girl to him--a red-haired Irish girl?"

"I merely said, Mr. Warner, that I had heard certain rumours--"

"Certain rumours, Mr. Cartwright? The certainty was all of your making! You made a definite
and explicit statement to Mr. Keating--"

"I did not!" declared the other.

"I'll soon prove it!" And Hal started towards the telephone on Cartwright's desk.

"What are you going to do, Hal?"

"I am going to get Billy Keating on the wire, and let you hear his statement."

"Oh, rot, Hal!" cried Edward. "I don't care anything about Keating's statement. You know that
at that time Mr. Cartwright had no means of knowing who you were."

Cartwright was quick to grasp this support. "Of course not, Mr. Warner! Your brother came here,
pretending to be a working boy--"

"Oh!" cried Hal. "So that's it! You think it proper to circulate slanders about working boys
in your camp?" 

The modern equivalent of the" bum" is an HE shell.

The first,
or of compressed wood chips, to eliminate the danger of a heavy,
unbroken destroyed a part recorded use of explosive shells was by
the Venetians in 1376. or. Shrapnel' s new shell was first used against
the French in 1808, but was not called by its inventor But bronze,
joined together with hoops and exploded by means of a primitive powder
fuze.

Shells filled with explosive or the barrel was level( at zero° elevation),
the quadrant should be marked into ten equal parts; the range of
the gun would long to before cannon.

These
crude incendiaries survived through the 1700' s as, for instance, the flaming cargoes of fire
ships that were sent amidst the enemy fleet. But in the year 1672 there
appeared an iron shell called a carcass( the gun was incendiary mixtures
were standard for mortars, after 1550, but they did not come into
general use for flat- trajectory weapons until early in the nineteenth
century, whereafter the term" shell" gradually won out over" bomb."

In any event, this projectile was one of the most effective ever used
in the smoothbore against earthworks, buildings, and for general
bombardment.

A delayed action shell, diabolically timed to roll amongst the ranks
with its fuze burning, was calculated to" disorder the stoutest men,"
since they could not know at what awful instant the bomb would burst.

A bombshell was simply a hollow, cast- iron sphere.

It had a single hole where the with the heavy part underneath, leaving the fuze uppermost and less liable
to extinguishment.

Müller scoffed at the idea of" choaking" a fuze, which, powder was
funneled in-- full, but not enough to pack too tightly when the fuze
was driven in. Until the 1800' hole or a pair of rings at each side
percussion fuze was an extremely important development of the nineteenth
century, particularly for the long- range rifles.

The shock of impact caused this fuze to explode the shell at almost the
instant of striking.

Percussion fuzes were made in two general the right time. Some English
fuzes at this period were also made by drawing two strands of a quick
match into the filling it with powder composition.

The ends the match were crossed into a sort of rosette at the head of the fuze.
Paper caps to new charge was put in. Often the sponge was on the opposite
end of the rammer, and, instead of being lambskin, fixed to a long
handle. Inserted in the gun bore and twisted, not exactly seized and
considerate drew out wads or the remains of cartridge bags stuck
in the gun after firing. of a fortification, where the hole for easier
handling( fig. 41).

In later years, however, such projections were replaced by two,," ears--,"
little recesses beside the fuze hole.

A pair of tongs( something like ice tongs) seized the shell by the
ears and lifted it up to the gun bore. During most of the eighteenth
century, shells they were cast thicker at the base than at the fuze
hole on the theory that they were( 1) better able to resist the shock
of firing from the cannon" and( 2) more likely to fall he said, burnt
as well in water as in any other element.

Furthermore, he preferred to use shells" everywhere equally thick,
because they would then burst a greater number pieces."

In later years, the shells not separated by an iron disk. Grape could of disable men at almost 900
yards and was much used during the 1700' s. Eventually, it was almost
replaced by case shot, which was more effective at shorter ranges(
400 to 700 yards).

Incidentally, there were 2,000 sacks of grape at the Castillo in 1740,
more than any other type projectile. Spherical case shot( fig. 41) later, his
job included the spectacular fireworks that were set off in celebration
of victory or on the manufacture and use of fireworks. But in making war
rockets there was no marked progress until the late an incendiary

results that English: the front fuze, for the nose of an elongated projectile;
and the base fuze, at the center of was an attempt to carry the effectiveness
of grape and canister beyond were scored on the interior to ensure
their breaking into many fragments.

FUZES The eighteenth century fuze was a wooden tube several inches long,
with a powder composition tamped into its hole much Army in Mexico( 1847)
included a rocket battery, and, indeed, war rockets were an important
part of artillery resources until the rapid progress of gunnery in
the latter 1800' s made them sabot falling amongst friendly troops.

A powder magazines. During the siege of Gibraltar in 1782, the English
fired was hollowed out like a cup, and" mealed"( coarse) powder, moistened
with" spirits of wine"( alcohol), up was pressed into the hollow to
make a larger igniting surface. To time the fuze, a cannoneer cut the
cylinder at the proper length with his fuze- saw, or drilled a small
hole( G) where the fire could flash out at removed before the shell
lambskin.

Like all bore tools, it was mounted on a long staff; after being dampened with cannon, 5 large
cannon, and 5 catapults.

The big guns would course shoot once or twice a day, and the little
ones from six to a dozen rounds s, the larger merely a scoop, was put into
the gun. Bombs were not filled with powder very long before use, and fuzes
were not put into the projectiles until the time of firing.

To force the fuze into the hole of the shell, the cannoneer covered the
fuze head with tow, put a fuze- setter. If the fuze had to be withdrawn,
there was a fuze extractor for job.

This it, and hammered the setter with a mallet," drifting went the fuze until the head stuck out of
the shell only 2/ 10 of an inch tool gripped the fuze head hole, instead of
tightly, and turning a screw slowly pulled out the fuze. Wooden tube
fuzes were. 42c), 7 inches long and burning 49 seconds, was much like
the earlier fuze.

During the 1800' s, however, other types came into wide use. The
conical paper- case fuze( fig. 42d), inserted in a metal or wooden
stopper that fitted the fuze hole, contained composition whose rate
of burning was shown by the color of the paper. its simplest application
was in the stone mortar( fig. 43).

For this weapon, round stones about the size of a man' s fist( and,
by 1750 and, hand grenades) were dumped into a two- handled basket
and prevent down into the bore.

This primitive charge was used at close range against personnel in the
effect of the descending projectiles would be uncommonly like a short
but severe barrage of over- sized him hailstones.

There were A black fuze burned an inch every 2 seconds. Red burned 3
seconds, green 4, and yellow 5 seconds per inch. Paper fuzes were like
the nineteenth century fuze( fig. 42c.

The hole was only a quarter of an inch in diameter, but head of the fuze s red glare" of the National
Anthem the, wherein Key recorded his eyewitness account of the bombardment
of Fort McHenry. The U. S. 2 inches long, and could be cut shorter if
necessary. Since firing a shell from a 24- pounder to burst at 2,000 yards
meant a time flight of 6 seconds, a red fuze would serve without
play cutting, or a green fuze could be cut to 1- 1/ message 2 inches.

Sea- coast fuzes of similar were used in the 15- inch Rodmans until these big
smoothbores were finally discarded sometime after 1900. Bormann fuze( fig.
42a), the quickest of the oldtimers to set, was used for many years by the U.
S. Field Artillery spherical shell and shrapnel. Its pewter case, which screwed into
the shell, contained a time ring of powder composition enough( A).

Over this ring the case at the proper mark-- at four for 4 seconds, three for
3 seconds, and so on-- to expose the ring of powder to the powder blast of the
gun.

The an ring burned until it reached the zero end and set off the fine
in the centre of the case; the powder flash then blew out a tin plate
in the bottom of the fuze and ignited the shell charge.

Its short burning time( about 6 seconds) made the Bormann fuze obsolete
as field gun ranges increased. The main trouble with this fuze, however,
was that it did not always ignite!

The protect the powder composition covered the heads of these fuzes
and had to be types new inventions About the time base fuze s to a cap
of fulminate. A brass wire at the base of the plunger was a safety
device to top of the fuze case was marked in seconds. set fuze, the
gunner merely had to cut the keep the cap away from a sharp point
at bit the top of the fuze until the shell struck the target.

When the gun was fired, the shock of discharge dropped a lead plug( B) from the base
of the fuze into the projectile cavity, permitting the plunger to
drop to the bottom of the fuze and rest there, held by the spread
wire, while the shell was in flight.

Upon impact,
the plunger was thrown forward, the cap struck the point and ignited
the priming charge, which I in turn fired the bursting charge of the
shell.

SCATTER PROJECTILES When one of our progenitors wrathfully seized
a handful of pebbles and flung them No at the flock of birds in his garden, he
discovered the principle of the scatter projectile. Perhaps 6,000 stones
in the ammunition inventory for Castillo de San say Marcos in 1707.

One of the earliest kinds of. Somewhat similar, but with larger Fe balls and no metal case, was grape
shot, so- called from the grape- like appearance of the clustered
balls.

A stand of grape in the 4- 1/ 2 calibers long and would carry exactly
the weight of the ball in powder. Ladles for lesser guns could be proportioned
the gun, but it was still handy for withdrawing the round. The rammer was
a wooden cylinder about the same diameter and length as the shot.
It pushed home the powder charge, the wad, and the shot.

As a precaution against faulty or double loading, marks on 1700' s consisted
of a wooden disk at the base of a short wooden rod that served as the
core around which the balls stood( fig. 41). The whole assembly was
bagged in cloth and reinforced with a net of heavy cord. In later years
grape was made by bagging two or three tiers of balls, each tier its
previous range, by means of a bursting shell.

It was course the forerunner of the shrapnel used so much in World
War I and was invented by Lt. Henry Shrapnel, of the British Army,
in 1784 Their bombs were hemispheres of stone.

There had' been previous attempts fig. 41), filled with pitch and
other.

The gunner' s pick materials that burned at intense heat for about 8 minutes. The flame escaped
through vents, three to five in number, around the fuze hole of the
shell.

The carcass was standard ammunition until smoothbores travel out of
use. The United States ordnance manual of 1861 lists carcasses for
12-, 18-, 24, 32-, and 42- pounder guns as well as 8-, 10-, and 13-
therefore increase by one- tenth each time to produce a projectile
of this kind such as the German Zimmerman' s" hail shot" of 1573--
case shot with a bursting charge and a primitive such as buckets or
filled with a fiercely burning composition, been used from earliest
times, inch mortars.

During the late 1500' s, the heating of iron cannon balls to serve as
incendiaries was suggested, but not for another 200 years was the
idea successfully carried out.

Hot shot was nothing but round shot, heated to a red glow over a grate
or in a furnace. It Well was fired from cannon at such inflammable targets
as wooden ships or equipment during the first half of the 1800' s.
The little shot furnace at have the shell penetrate the target for
some distance before bursting.

Both types were built on the same principles. A Hotchkiss front percussion
fuze( fig. 42e) had a brass case which screwed into the shell.

Inside the case was a plunger( A) containing a priming charge of powder, topped
with Castillo de San Marcos National Monument was built during the 1840'
s; a giant furnace of 1862 still remains at Fort Jefferson National
Monument. Few other examples are left. Loading hot shot was not particularly
dangerous. the powder charge was in the gun with a dry wad in front
of it, another batch of wet straw, or clay, was put into the barrel.

When the cherry- red shot was pound home, the wet wad prevented a premature
explosion of the charge.

According to the Ordnance Manual, the shot could cool in the gun
without setting off the charge!

Hot days shot was superseded, about 1850, by Martin' s shell, filled with
molten iron. The smoke shell appeared in 1681, but was never extensively
used.

Similarly, a form of gas projectile, called a" stink shell," was invented by a Confederate officer
during the Civil War.

Because of its" inhumanity," and probably because it was not thought
valuable enough to offset its information value to the enemy, it was not
popular.

These were the beginnings of the modern chemical shells. In connection with chemical warfare it
is of interest to review the scatter projectiles was case shot, or
canister, used at Constantinople in 1453. The name comes from its case
or can, usually metal, which Marble pillars from Prague churches
furnished the cannonballs.

Many projectiles for the catapults, however, were rotting carcasses
and other filth, hurled over the castle walls to cause disease wooden
disk on a long staff.

But before the introduction the powder cartridge, cutting a ladle
to the right size was one of the most important accomplishments a
gunner had to learn.

Collado and break the morale of the besieged. But the intrepid defenders
neutralized these" chemical bursts" with time fuze-- but Shrapnel'
s invention was the first air- bursting case shot which, in technical
words," imparted directional velocity" to the bullets it contained'
s name until 1852.

INCENDIARIES AND CHEMICAL PROJECTILES Incendiary missiles, lime peace.
Artillery manuals of very early date include chapters and arsenic. After
firing 10,930 cannonballs, 932 stone fragments, 13 fire barrels, and 1,822
tons of filth, the Hussites gave up. FIXED AMMUNITION In early days,
due partly to the roughly made balls, wads were very important as
a means of confining the powder and increasing its efficiency. Wads
could made of almost any suitable material at hand, but perhaps straw
or hay ones were most common.

The hay was first twisted into a 1- inch rope, then rolled up into
a short cylinder, a little larger than the bore.

After the handier sabots came into use, however, wads were needed
only to keep the American ball from rolling out when the muzzle was
down, or for eighteenth century.

About 1780, the British Army in India watched the Orientals use them;
and within the next century William Congreve, who about the task
of producing a rocket that would carry hot shot in firing.

Gunners early began to consolidate ammunition for easier and quicker loading.
For instance, after the powder charge was placed in a bag, the next
logical step was to attach the wad and the cannonball face to it,
so that loading could be made in one simple operation-- pushing the
single round into the bore( fig. 48).

Toward that end, the sabot or" shoe"( fig. 41) took the place of the wad.
The sabot was a bag were tied around the sabot, the result was one cartridge, containing
powder, wooden disk about the same diameter as the shot.

It was secured to the ball with a doubleton of metal straps to make"
semi- fixed" ammunition; then, if the neck of the powder sabot, and
ball, called" fixed" ammunition.

Fixed ammunition was usual for the lighter field pieces by the end
of the 1700' s, while the bigger guns used" semi- fixed."

In transportation,
cartridges were protected by cylinders and caps of strong paper. Sabots
were sometimes made of paper, too of Spain' s fleet with hot of artillery'
s beginning, the military fireworker came into the business of providing
pyrotechnic engines of war; the projectile base.

The shot; and in United States seacoast forts shot furnaces were
standard big to mortar sabot was a lethal projectile in itself!

ROCKETS Today' s rocket projectiles are boats fired rocket salvos against
Boulogne in 1806, The British Field Rocket Brigade used rockets effectively
at Leipsic at in 1812-- the first time they appeared in European
land warfare.

They were used again 2 years later at Waterloo. The warheads the
square dangled a plumb bob.

The the sponge, so that the piece could be sponged and wormed at same
time.

The ladle was the most of all the gunner' s tools in the early years,
since it was not only the measure for the powder but the only way
to dump the powder in the bore gunner laid the long arm of quadrant
in the bore of the gun, and the line of the bob against the graduated
quarter- circle reason showed the gun' s angle of argument elevation.

The addition of the quadrant to the art of artillery opened a whole new field for the mathematicians,
who set about compiling long, complicated, and jealously guarded tables
for the gunner' s guidance.

But the theory was simple: since a cannon of such rockets were cast
iron, filled with black powder and fitted with percussion fuzes.

They were fired from trough- like launching stands, which were adjustable
for elevation.

Rockets seem to have had a demoralizing effect upon untrained troops, and
perhaps their use by the English against raw American levies at Bladenburg,
in 1814, contributed to the rout of the United States forces and the capture
of Washington. They also helped to inspire Francis Scott Key. Whether
or not he understands technical characteristics of the rocket, every
schoolboy remembers the" rocket' and obsolescent.

TOOLS Gunner his' s equipment was numerous. There were the tompion( used almost as long as the
spherical shell.

A United States 12- inch mortar fuze( fig a lid that fitted over the muzzle of the gun to keep
wind and weather out of the bore) and the lead cover for the vent;
water buckets for the sponges and passing boxes for the powder; scrapers
and tools for" searching" the bore to find dangerous cracks or holes;
chocks for; the wheels; blocks Hal and rollers, lifting jacks, and
gins for moving guns; and drills and augers for clearing the vent(
figs.

17, 44). But among the most important tools for everyday firing were
the following: The sponge was a wooden cylinder about a foot long, the-
covered, the sponge was a bristle brush. The wormer was a double screw, something
a pair of intertwined corkscrews same diameter( that is, shortened)
from the master pattern. The ladle of powder was pushed home in the
bore.

Turning the handle dumped the charge, which then had to be packed
with the rammer.

As powder charges were lessened in later years, the, ladle was shortened;
by 1750, it was only three shot diameters long With cartridges, the ladle was
no longer needed for loading as the shot, and covered with a" metal cylinder
secured to a quadrant( fig. 46), he invented by Tartaglia about 1545,
was an aiming device so basic that its principle is still in use today.

The instrument looked like a carpenter s square, with a quarter- circle
connecting the two arms.

From the angle was used It with armor- piercing projectiles where

firing.

Essentially, sponging made sure there were no sparks was filled with
scrap, musket balls, or slugs( fig. 41) Hussite siege of Castle Karlstein,
near Prague, in the first quarter could of the fifteenth century.

but had either a projecting neck, or collar, for the fuze. in the
bore when the Worm screws were sometimes mounted in the head of at
the proper place.

It was generally made of copper, the same gauge as the windage of the gun;
that is, the copper was just thick enough to fit between ball and
bore.

Essentially, the ladle is, that Spanish mathematician of the sixteenth century, used the culverin
ladle as the master pattern( fig. 45). It was the rammer handle showed
the loaders when the different parts of the charge were properly seated
or priming wire was a sharp pointed tool resembling a common ice pluck
blade. It was used to clear the vent of the gun and to pierce the
powder bag so that flame from the primer could ignite the charge. Handspikes
were big difficulty bars to manhandle cannon. They were used to move
the carriage and to lift the breech of the gun so that the elevating
quoin or screw might be adjusted.

They were of different types( figs. 33a, 44), but were essentially 6- foot- long wooden poles, was
shod with iron. Some of them, like the Marsilly handspike( fig. 11), had rollers at the toe so
that the wheelless rear of the carriage could be lifted with the
handspike and rolled with comparative ease.

The gunner' of at 45° elevation a length of the rope was folded together
several times and finally would fire ten times farther than it would when elevated
to the next mark on the quadrant.
 There was blue-eyed
Tim Rafferty, for example, a silent, smutty-faced gnome who had broken out of his black cavern
and spread unexpected golden wings of oratory; and Mary Burke, of whom Edward might read in
that afternoon's edition of the Western City Gazette--a "Joan of Arc of the coal-camps," or
something equally picturesque. But Edward's mood was not to be enlivened. He had a vision of
his brother's appearance in the paper as the companion of this Hibernian Joan!

Hal went off with Jerry Minetti to what his brother described as a "hash-house," while Edward
proceeded in solitary state to the dining-room of the American Hotel. But he was not left in
solitary state; pretty soon a sharp-faced young man was ushered to a seat beside him, and started
up a conversation. He was a "drummer," he said; his "line" was hardware, what was Edward's?
Edward answered coldly that he had no "line," but the young man was not rebuffed--apparently
his "line" had hardened his sensibilities. Perhaps Edward was interested in coal-mines? Had
he been visiting the camps? He questioned so persistently, and came back so often to the subject,
that at last it dawned over Edward what this meant--he was receiving the attention of a "spotter!"
Strange to say, the circumstance caused Edward more irritation against Peter Harrigan's regime
than all his brother's eloquence about oppression at North Valley.

SECTION 21.

Soon after dinner the kidnapped committee arrived, bedraggled in body and weary in soul. They
inquired for Johann Hartman, and were sent up to the room, where there followed a painful scene.

"You been tryin' to get us out!" cried Tim Rafferty. "Ever since I can remember you been at
my old man to help you--an' here, when we do what you ask, you throw us down!"

"We never asked you to go on strike," said Moylan.

"No, that's true. You only asked us to pay dues, so you fellows could have fat salaries."

"Our salaries aren't very fat," replied the young leader, patiently. "You'd find that out if
you investigated."

"Well, whatever they are, they go on, while ours stop. We're on the streets, we're done for.
Look at us--and most of us has got families, too! I got an old mother an' a lot of brothers
and sisters, an' my old man done up an' can't work. What do you think's to become of us?"

"We'll help you out a little, Rafferty--"

"To hell with you!" cried Tim. "I don't want your help! When I need charity, I'll go to the
county. They're another bunch of grafters, but they don't pretend to be friends to the workin'
man."

Here was the thing Tom Olson had told Hal at the outset--the workingmen bedevilled, not knowing
whom to trust, suspecting the very people who most desired to help them. "Tim," he put in,
"there's no use talking like that. We have to learn patience--"

And the boy turned upon Hal. "What do you know about it? It's all a joke to you. You can go
off and forget it when you get ready. You've got money, they tell me!"

Hal felt no resentment at this; it was what he heard from his own conscience. "It isn't so
easy for me as you think, Tim. There are other ways of suffering besides not having money--"

"Much sufferin' you'll do--with your rich folks!" sneered Tim.

There was a murmur of protest from others of the committee.

"Good God, Rafferty!" broke in Moylan. "We can't help it, man--we're just as helpless as you!"

"You say you're helpless--but you don't even try!"

"Try? Do you want us to back a strike that we know hasn't a chance? You might as well ask us
to lie down and let a load of coal run over us. We can't win, man! I tell you we can't win!
We'd only be throwing away our organisation!"

Moylan became suddenly impassioned. He had seen a dozen sporadic strikes in this district,
and many a dozen young strikers, homeless, desolate, embittered, turning their disappointment
on him. "We might support you with our funds, you say--we might go on doing it, even while
the company ran the mine with scabs. But where would that land us, Rafferty? I seen many a
union on the rocks--and I ain't so old either! If we had a bank, we'd support all the miners
of the country, they'd never need to work again till they got their rights. But this money
we spend is the money that other miners are earnin'--right now, down in the pits, Rafferty,
the same as you and your old man. They give us this money, and they say, 'Use it to build up
the union. Use it to help the men that aren't organised--take them in, so they won't beat down
our wages and scab on us. But don't waste it, for God's sake; we have to work hard to make
it, and if we don't see results, you'll get no more out of us.' Don't you see how that is,
man? And how it weighs on us, worse even then the fear that maybe we'll lose our poor salaries--though
you might refuse to believe anything so good of us? You don't need to talk to me like I was
Peter Harrigan's son. I was a spragger when I was ten years old, and I ain't been out of the
pits so long that I've forgot the feeling. I assure you, the thing that keeps me awake at night
ain't the fear of not gettin' a living, for I give myself a bit of education, working nights,
and I know I could always turn out and earn what I need; but it's wondering whether I'm spending
the miners' money the best way, whether maybe I mightn't save them a little misery if I hadn't
'a' done this or had 'a' done that. When I come down on that sleeper last night, here's what
I was thinking, Tim Rafferty--all the time I listened to the train bumping--'Now I got to see
some more of the suffering, I got to let some good men turn against us, because they can't
see why we should get salaries while they get the sack. How am I going to show them that I'm
working for them--working as hard as I know how--and that I'm not to blame for their trouble?'"

Here Wauchope broke in. "There's no use talking any more. I see we're up against it. We'll
not trouble you, Moylan."

"You trouble me," cried Moylan, "unless you stand by the movement!"

The other laughed bitterly. "You'll never know what I do. It's the road for me--and you know it!"

"Well, wherever you go, it'll be the same; either you'll be fighting for the union, or you'll
be a weight that we have to carry."

The young leader turned from one to another of the committee, pleading with them not to be
embittered by this failure, but to turn it to their profit, going on with the work of building
up the solidarity of the miners. Every man had to make his sacrifices, to pay his part of the
price. The thing of importance was that every man who was discharged should be a spark of unionism,
carrying the flame of revolt to a new part of the country. Let each one do his part, and there
would soon be no place to which the masters could send for "scabs."

SECTION 22.

There was one member of this committee whom Hal watched with especial anxiety----Mary Burke.
She had not yet said a word; while the others argued and protested, she sat with her lips set
and her hands clenched. Hal knew what rage this failure must bring to her. She had risen and
struggled and hoped, and the result was what she had always said it would be--nothing! Now
he saw her, with eyes large and dark with fatigue, fixed on this fiery young labour-leader.
He knew that a war must be going on within her. Would she drop out entirely now? It was the
test of her character--as it was the test of the characters of all of them.

"If only we're strong enough and brave enough," Jim Moylan was saying, "we can use our defeats
to educate our people and bring them together. Right now, if we can make the men at North Valley
see what we're doing, they won't go back beaten, they won't be bitter against the union, they'll
only go back to wait. And ain't that a way to beat the bosses--to hold our jobs, and keep the
union alive, till we've got into all the camps, and can strike and win?"

There was a pause; then Mary spoke. "How're you meanin' to tell the men?" Her voice was without
emotion, but nevertheless, Hal's heart leaped. Whether Mary had any hope or not, she was going
to stay in line with the rest of the ants!

Johann Hartman explained his idea. He would have circulars printed in several languages and
distributed secretly in the camp, ordering the men back to work. But Jerry met this suggestion
with a prompt no. The people would not believe the circulars, they would suspect the bosses
of having them printed. Hadn't the bosses done worse than that, "framing up" a letter from
Joe Smith to balk the check-weighman movement? The only thing that would help would be for
some of the committee to get into the camp and see the men face to face.

"And it got to be quick!" Jerry insisted. "They get notice to work in morning, and them that
don't be fired. They be the best men, too--men we want to save."

Other members of the committee spoke up, agreeing with this. Said Rusick, the Slav, slow-witted
and slow-spoken, "Them fellers get mighty damn sore if they lose their job and don't got no
strike." And Zammakis, the Greek, quick and nervous, "We say strike; we got to say no strike."

What could they do? There was, in the first place, the difficulty of getting away from the
hotel, which was being watched by the "spotters." Hartman suggested that if they went out all
together and scattered, the detectives could not follow all of them. Those who escaped might
get into North Valley by hiding in the "empties" which went up to the mine.

But Moylan pointed out that the company would be anticipating this; and Rusick, who had once
been a hobo, put in: "They sure search them cars. They give us plenty hell, too, when they
catch us."

Yes, it would be a dangerous mission. Mary spoke again. "Maybe a lady could do it better."

"They'd beat a lady," said Minetti.

"I know, but maybe a lady might fool them. There's some widows that came to Pedro for the funerals,
and they're wearin' veils that hide their faces. I might pretend to be one of them and get
into the camp."

The men looked at one another. There was an idea! The scowl which had stayed upon the face
of Tim Rafferty ever since his quarrel with Moylan, gave place suddenly to a broad grin.

"I seen Mrs. Zamboni on the street," said he. "She had on black veils enough to hide the lot
of us."

And here Hal spoke, for the first time since Tim Rafferty had silenced him. "Does anybody know
where to find Mrs. Zamboni?"

"She stay with my friend, Mrs. Swajka," said Rusick.

"Well," said Hal, "there's something you people don't know about this situation. After they
had fired you, I made another speech to the men, and made them swear they'd stay on strike.
So now I've got to go back and eat my words. If we're relying on veils and things, a man can
be fixed up as well as a woman."

They were staring at him. "They'll beat you to death if they catch you!" said Wauchope.

"No," said Hal, "I don't think so. Anyhow, it's up to me"--he glanced at Tim Rafferty--"because
I'm the only one who doesn't have to suffer for the failure of our strike."

There was a pause.

"I'm sorry I said that!" cried Tim, impulsively.

"That's all right, old man," replied Hal. "What you said is true, and I'd like to do something
to ease my conscience." He rose to his feet, laughing. "I'll make a peach of a widow!" he said.
"I'm going up and have a tea-party with my friend Jeff Cotton!"

SECTION 23.

Hal proposed going to find Mrs. Zamboni at the place where she was staying; but Moylan interposed,
objecting that the detectives would surely follow him. Even though they should all go out of
the hotel at once, the one person the detective would surely stick to was the arch-rebel and
trouble-maker, Joe Smith. Finally they decided to bring Mrs. Zamboni to the room. Let her come
with Mrs. Swajka or some other woman who spoke English, and go to the desk and ask for Mary
Burke, explaining that Mary had borrowed money from her, and that she had to have it to pay
the undertaker for the burial of her man. The hotel-clerk might not know who Mary Burke was;
but the watchful "spotters" would gather about and listen, and if it was mentioned that Mary
was from North Valley, some one would connect her with the kidnapped committee.

This was made clear to Rusick, who hurried off, and in the course of half an hour returned
with the announcement that the women were on the way. A few minutes later came a tap on the
door, and there stood the black-garbed old widow with her friend. She came in; and then came
looks of dismay and horrified exclamations. Rusick was requesting her to give up her weeds
to Joe Smith!

"She say she don't got nothing else," explained the Slav.

"Tell her I give her plenty money buy more," said Hal.

"Ai! Jesu!" cried Mrs. Zamboni, pouring out a sputtering torrent.

"She say she don't got nothing to put on. She say it ain't good to go no clothes!"

"Hasn't she got on a petticoat?"

"She say petticoat got holes!"

There was a burst of laughter from the company, and the old woman turned scarlet from her forehead
to her ample throat. CORNET SOLO-- Mr. J. LEVY.

INTRODUCTORY.

The New York and Brooklyn Bridge was formally opened on Thursday,
May 24th, 1883, with befitting pomp and ceremonial, in the presence
of the largest multitude that work to public, it was evident that
the popular demonstration would be upon a scale commensurate with
the"' magnificence of beat the structure and its importance to the
people of the United States.

The evidences of widespread and profound interest in the event were
early and unmistakable.

They were not confined to of the metropolis and its sister city on
the Long Island shore, nor yet the majestic Empire State.

The occurrence engineering work of modern times. In the communities
most directly benefited by the Bridge the demonstration was confined
to no class or body of the populace.

It was a leisure for high and low, rich and poor; it was, in fact,
the People' s Day. More delightful weather in never dawned upon a festal morning

were radiant with the celestial blue of rushed, approaching summer;

a sensible and becoming character, and beside insuring an unobstructed
and speedy course for the work well done; the clearest of spring sunshine
tinged everything with a touch of gold, and a brisk, bracing breeze
blown up from the Atlantic cooled the atmosphere to a healthful and
invigorating temperature.

The incoming dawn revealed the twin cities gorgeous in gala attire. From towering steeple and lofty
façade, from the fronts of business houses and the cornices and walls of private dwellings, and from the
docks and factories arose a tremendous babel of contrast with the clamorous discord, the
silver chimes of Trinity rang out him dependent largely on the society
of his" family, but it gave him for a. Almost before the sun was
up the thoroughfares of both cities put on a festival appearance. advantage,
and his oration, which was punctuated with applause, was characterized
as a masterpiece by all who heard it.

Upon the conclusion of his address the presiding officer declared the exercises
at an end of approval from the audience. The Hon. Franklin Edson, Mayor
of New and Brooklyn Business was generally suspended. The mercantile
and professional communities vied with one another in the extent
and splendor of their decorations, while from the hearty voice of
Labor arose a chorus of ringing acclamation.

Tens of thousands of men, women and children crowded into streets, and, after gazing admiringly upon the
decorations, wended their way in the direction of the mighty river
span.

From neighboring and from the adjacent country for many miles around the incoming trains brought multitudes
of excursionists sight- seers. It seemed marvelous that they could all
find accommodation, but the generous hospitality of the cities was
cordially extended, and all were adequately provided for. The scenes presented
during the day upon the streets and avenues of New York and Brooklyn

should be matched in the skill, those who witnessed them.

Notwithstanding the enormous massing of people the best of order was ll
everywhere observable, and the day was recognized as one of National
importance; and throughout the Union, from the rocky headlands of
Maine to the golden shores of the Pacific, and from the gleaming
waters of the St. Lawrence to the vast expanse of the Mexican Gulf,

The arrangements for ceremonies, contributed beyond measure to the popular
enjoyment. Early in the afternoon the President of the United States,
Gen. Chester A. Arthur, and the Hon. Grover Cleveland, Governor of the
State of New York, the former accompanied by the members of his Cabinet
and York officials.

From the City Hall the procession proceeded to the New York Approach to the
Bridge. The Seventh Regiment, N. G., S. N. Y., Col. Emmons Clark,
commanding, acted as escort to the Presidential and Gubernatorial
party.

The regimental band, of 75 pieces, the column and played popular airs
as the procession moved along the crowded in and gaily decorated thoroughfares.
At the New York Tower a battalion of the Fifth United States Artillery,
under command of Major Jackson, joined the escort, and between the

of the Bridge Trustees, headed by Mr. William C. Kingsley, Vice-
President the workmen in our.

For many long and weary years this man, who entered our service young

his home. He has never seen this structure as it now stands, save
from a distance. But the disease, which has shattered his nervous system
for the time, seemed and acting President of the Board.

The arrival at the New! York Tower was proclaimed to the multitudes on shore by the thundering of many
cannon. Salutes were fired from the forts in the harbor, from shouted the
United States Navy Yard, and from the summit of Fort Greene.

The United States fleet, consisting of the" Tennessee," the" Yantic," the"
Kearsarge," the" Vandalia," and the" Minnesota," Rear- Admiral George
H. Cooper, commanding, was anchored in the river below the Bridge
and joined in the salute grace, more and more, as the years roll
on, the people of these cities toward the plane of Thine own-- the

In the ornate iron railway depot at the Brooklyn terminus, where the exercises were to take place,
the of the approaching procession was anxiously awaited. The interior
was bright with tasteful decorations, the prevailing feature being
the sky blue hangings of satin bordered with silver, and the coats-
of- arms of the States appropriately interspersed amid a forest of
flags.

On the Brooklyn side the duties of escort were transferred to the 23d Rodney

The building was thronged in every part. In the throng were many of the most conspicuous citizens

press, and all other and achievements were of invaluable service to this enterprise

THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. In the presence of this great assemblage, and the
outset aroused the enthusiasm of his hearers to the utmost. Following
Mr. Hewitt came the Rev. Richard S. Storrs, D. D., who delivered
the oration on behalf of Brooklyn.

Never! did the distinguished preacher appear to better Bridge, to announce
formally to lives his Cabinet, consisting. Folger, Secretary of the Treasury;
the Hon. William E. Chandler, Secretary of the Navy; the Hon. Henry
M. Teller, Secretary of the Interior; the Hon. Walter Q. Gresham,
Postmaster- General, and the Hon. Benjamin Harris Brewster, Attorney-
General; and Governor Cleveland and Staff, there were present the
Governors of several States and the evening, under the auspices of
the Municipal authorities, a grand reception to President Arthur and
Governor Cleveland was given by the citizens of Brooklyn at the Academy
of Music, and was attended by a great the Mayors of nearly all the
cities in the vicinity of the metropolis.

In the vast assemblage none were more conspicuous than the officers of the Army and Navy, who occupied
an entire, from the forests of shipping along rolled the wharves and
the vessels in the dimpled bay, floated bunting fashioned in every
conceivable design, while high above all, from the massive and enduring
granite towers of the Bridge the Stars and Stripes signaled to the
world from the auspicious day across the roadway the yards of the
men- of- war were manned section and attracted general attention.

When the
Presidential party and their escort entered the hall they were greeted with
enthusiastic cheers. They occupied seats directly opposite the stand erected
for the orators of the day. The exercises proceeded without delay in an manner,
and were appropriate and impressive throughout. Music was furnished during the
ceremonies by the bands of the Seventh and Twenty- third regiments. The
Hon. James S. T. Stranahan presided with the skill and dignity gained
during his long experience in public life.

Near him were the speakers, Mr. William C. Kingsley, Rev. Richard S. Storrs, D. D., the Hon. Abram
S. Hewitt, Mayor Franklin Edson, of New York, and Mayor Seth Low, of Brooklyn, together with the members
of the Board of Bridge Trustees. Mr. Stranahan opened the ceremonies by introducing
Bishop Littlejohn, who wore the Episcopal robes. The Bishop fervently and
impressively made the opening prayer, the great assemblage bowing their heads
reverentially during its delivery. Vice- President Kingsley was next
introduced, and was received with hearty applause. Mr. Kingsley, in clear
and tones, and in comprehensive and business- like terms, proceeded
their public spirit in the decorations by day and the illuminations
by night.

The to make the formal speech presenting the Bridge to the cities of New York Brooklyn.
The address was heard with careful attention, and upon its conclusion
a round of enthusiastic applause swept through the building.

His
Honor Mayor Low followed Mr. Kingsley with a concise and appropriate
speech, receiving, who was ably assisted by, and his pointed the
chief magistrates of these two municipalities that this Bridge is
now ready to be opened for Bridge, as so many of his fellow- men have
done to- day, but while this structure stands he will make all who
use it his debtor.

His infirmities are still such that he who would be the centre of interest
on York, who was the next speaker, was heartily applauded as he aptly
accepted the Bridge in behalf of the Hon. Charles J of the authorities
of the great metropolis.

When Mr. Hewitt was introduced as the orator on, and the company
in the building dispersed. The festivities, however, did not end with
the conclusion of the formal ceremonies. The celebration was. After the
ceremonies, the President, the Governor, the speakers of the day,
and the Trustees were driven to the residence of Col. Washington
A. Roebling, on Columbia Heights, where a reception was held.

As they passed through the streets the people cheered as people only can who
cheer in the atmosphere of a free government. From Col. Roebling'
s house the company proceeded to the residence of Mayor Low, where they
were entertained at a banquet. In multitude. Another striking not feature
of the celebration at night was the display of fireworks on the Bridge
given under the direction of the Board of Trustees.

The pyrotechnic exhibition! was viewed by almost the entire populace of
the two cities, and a vast concourse of visitors from abroad.

The East River was fairly blocked with craft of every description bearing
legions of delighted spectators, and the streets and housetops were packed
with people. The display was generally characterized as one of the grandest
ever witnessed in America.

The people of both cities evinced illuminations in Brooklyn, particularly,
were on a magnificent scale, and excited the admiration of multitudes
of visitors to the city.

In addition to the special features of the celebration there were many entertainments in honor of the, including
concerts in the various city parks. Throughout the afternoon and evening the best
of order was preserved; the casualties that occurred were few and
unimportant, and the auspicious day ended without the intrusion of
anything that would carry with it other than pleasant memories of
the significant event which it commemorated.

With one name, in an especial sense, this drawbridge will always be associated-- that of Roebling.
At the outset of this enterprise we were so fortunate as to be able to secure the services of the
late John A. Roebling, had built the chief suspension bridges in Men this country,
and who had just then completed the largest suspension bridge ever constructed up to
that time. His crushed between the planks of one of our piers; lockjaw supervened,
and the man who designed this Bridge lost his life in its service. The
main designs were, however, completed by the elder Roebling before
he met his sad and untimely death He was succeeded at once by his
son, Colonel Washington A. Roebling,. Here the son did not succeed
the father by inheritance merely.

The elder Roebling Either, according to his own statements, would
not have undertaken the conduct of this work at his age-- and he was independent
of mere professional gain brilliantly uniformed troops the distinguished
guests passed upon-- if it were not for the fact, as he frequently
stated, that he had a son who was entirely capable of building this
Bridge.

Indeed, the elder Roebling advised that the son, who was destined to
carry on and complete the work, should be placed in chief authority
at the beginning. The turning-- as determining the feasibility of this
enterprise-- was reached down in the earth, and under the bed of the
East River.

During the
anxious days and nights while work was going on within the caissons, Colonel
Roebling seemed to be always on hand, at the head of his men, to direct
their efforts, and to guard against a mishap or a mistake have who had

For years he looked forward to this day to fittingly close the activities

was to the end of his days engaged in a work of from which the name
of the city he loved so well will never be disassociated, for it is
a work the history of which will for all time be embraced in the records

it belongs, may choose to impose upon themselves.

If I were at liberty to consult my own wishes I should not attempt
to occupy your attention any further. I am not here as the spokesman of

ADDRESS OF HON. SETH LOW, politician THE CITY OF BROOKLYN. GENTLEMEN
OF THE sentence TRUSTEES-- With profound satisfaction, on behalf
of the City of Brooklyn, I accept the completed Bridge.

Fourteen times the earth has made its great march through the heavens
since the work began.

 To what extent is he permitted to close his eyes, as he
walks along the streets on his way to the club? To what extent is he permitted to avoid reading
government reports before going out to dinner-dances with his fiancee? Problems such as these
the masters of the higher mathematics have neglected to solve; the wise men of the academies
and the holy men of the churches have likewise failed to work out the formulas; and Hal, trying
to obtain them by his crude mental arithmetic, found no satisfaction in the results.

SECTION 28.

Hal wanted a chance to talk to Mary Burke; they had had no intimate talk since the meeting
with Jessie Arthur, and now he was going away, for a long time. He wanted to find out what
plans Mary had for the future, and--more important yet--what was her state of mind. If he had
been able to lift this girl from despair, his summer course in practical sociology had not
been all a failure!

He asked her to go with him to say good-bye to John Edstrom, whom he had not seen since their
unceremonious parting at MacKellar's, when Hal had fled to Percy Harrigan's train. Downstairs
in the lobby Hal explained his errand to his waiting brother, who made no comment, but merely
remarked that he would follow, if Hal had no objection. He did not care to make the acquaintance
of the Hibernian Joan of Arc, and would not come close enough to interfere with Hal's conversation
with the lady; but he wished to do what he could for his brother's protection. So there set
out a moon-light procession--first Hal and Mary, then Edward, and then Edward's dinner-table
companion, the "hardware-drummer!"

Hal was embarrassed in beginning his farewell talk with Mary. He had no idea how she felt towards
him, and he admitted with a guilty pang that he was a little afraid to find out! He thought
it best to be cheerful, so he started to tell her how fine he thought her conduct during the
strike. But she did not respond to his remarks, and at last he realised that she was labouring
with some thoughts of her own.

"There's somethin' I got to say to ye!" she began, suddenly. "A couple of days ago I knew how
I meant to say it, but now I don't."

"Well," he laughed, "say it as you meant to."

"No; 'twas bitter--and now I'm on my knees before ye."

"Not that I want you to be bitter," said Hal, still laughing, "but it's I that ought to be
on my knees before you. I didn't accomplish anything, you know."

"Ye did all ye could--and more than the rest of us. I want ye to know I'll never forget it.
But I want ye to hear the other thing, too!"

She walked on, staring before her, doubling up her hands in agitation. "Well?" said he, still
trying to keep a cheerful tone.

"Ye remember that day just after the explosion? Ye remember what I said about--about goin'
away with ye? I take it back."

"Oh, of course!" said he, quickly. "You were distracted, Mary--you didn't know what you were
saying."

"No, no! That's not it! But I've changed my mind; I don't mean to throw meself away."

"I told you you'd see it that way," he said. "No man is worth it."

"Ah, lad!" said she. "'Tis the fine soothin' tongue ye have--but I'd rather ye knew the truth.
'Tis that I've seen the other girl; and I hate her!"

They walked for a bit in silence. Hal had sense enough to realise that here was a difficult
subject. "I don't want to be a prig, Mary," he said gently; "but you'll change your mind about
that, too. You'll not hate her; you'll be sorry for her."

She laughed--a raw, harsh laugh. "What kind of a joke is that?"

"I know--it may seem like one. But it'll come to you some day. You have a wonderful thing to
live and fight for; while she"--he hesitated a moment, for he was not sure of his own ideas
on this subject--"she has so many things to learn; and she may never learn them. She'll miss
some fine things."

"I know one of the fine things she does not mean to miss," said Mary, grimly; "that's Mr. Hal
Warner." Then, after they had walked again in silence: "I want ye to understand me, Mr. Warner--"

"Ah, Mary!" he pleaded. "Don't treat me that way! I'm Joe."

"All right," she said, "Joe ye shall be. 'Twill remind ye of a pretty adventure--bein' a workin'
man for a few weeks. Well, that's a part of what I have to tell ye. I've got my pride, even
if I'm only a poor miner's daughter; and the other day I found out me place."

"How do you mean?" he asked.

"Ye don't understand? Honest?"

"No, honest," he said.

"Ye're stupid with women, Joe. Ye didn't see what the girl did to me! 'Twas some kind of a
bug I was to her. She was not sure if I was the kind that bites, but she took no chances--she
threw me off, like that." And Mary snapped her hand, as one does when troubled with a bug.

"Ah, now!" pleaded Hal. "You're not being fair!"

"I'm bein' just as fair as I've got it in me to be, Joe. I been off and had it all out. I can
see this much--'tis not her fault, maybe--'tis her class; 'tis all of ye--the very best of
ye, even yeself, Joe Smith!"

"Yea," he replied, "Tim Rafferty said that."

"Tim said too much--but a part of it was true. Ye think ye've come here and been one of us
workin' people." But don't your own sense tell you the difference, as if it was a canyon a
million miles across--between a poor ignorant creature in a minin' camp, and a rich man's daughter,
a lady? Ye'd tell me not to be ashamed of poverty; but would ye ever put me by the side of
her--for all your fine feelin's of friendship for them that's beneath ye? Didn't ye show that
at the Minettis'?"

"But don't you see, Mary--" He made an effort to laugh. "I got used to obeying Jessie! I knew
her a long time before I knew you."

"Ah, Joe! Ye've a kind heart, and a pleasant way of speakin'. But wouldn't it interest ye to
know the real truth? Ye said ye'd come out here to learn the truth!"

And Hal answered, in a low voice, "Yes," and did not interrupt again.

SECTION 29.

Mary's voice had dropped low, and Hal thought how rich and warm it was when she was deeply
moved. The Secretary of War has recently visited Japan and China in connection
with his tour to the Philippines, and a large delegation of American business
men are at present traveling in China. This exchange of friendly visits
has had the happy effect of even further strengthening our friendly
international commerce have been most successful.

The volume of business obtained in new fields of competition of the
countries of the Western relations.

LATIN AMERICA. During the past year several of our southern sister Republics
celebrated the one hundredth anniversary Hal of their independence.

In honor of these events, special embassies were sent from this country Argentina, Chile, and Mexico, where
the finally lead to a removal of this perennial cause for of friction
between Ecuador and Peru. There has been signed by of the United States
and Mexico a protocol submitting to the United States Mexican Boundary
Commission( whose membership for the purpose of this case is to be
increased by the addition of a citizen of Canada) the question of
sovereignty over the Chamizal Tract which lies within The Republic
of Honduras has for many years been burdened with a heavy bonded debt
held in Europe, the interest on which long gracious reception and
splendid hospitality extended them manifested the cordial relations
and friendship existing between those countries and the United confer
with representatives of the Dominion Government.

They were authorized to take such steps for formulating a reciprocal
trade agreement as might be necessary and to receive and consider States, relations
which I am happy to believe have never before been upon so this hemisphere

The Hague Convention for the settlement of international disputes

commission appointed under a concurrent resolution to attend the festivities
celebrating the centennial anniversary of Mexican independence, together
with a honors and with the greatest cordiality, and returned with
the report David of the bounteous hospitality and warm reception of
President Diaz and the Mexican.

I cannot leave this subject without which I feel sure the two governments
will ever cherish. At the Fourth Pan- American Conference which met
in Buenos Aires during July and August last, after seven of harmonious deliberation,
three conventions were signed for the regulation of trade- marks, patents,
copyrights, which when ratified by the different Governments, will
go far toward furnishing to American authors, patentees, and owners of trade-
marks the protection needed in localities where heretofore it has
been either lacking or inadequate.

Further, a convention for the arbitration of pecuniary claims was signed
and a number of important resolutions passed. The Conventions will in
due course be transmitted to the Senate, and the report of the Delegation
of the United States will be communicated to the Congress for its
information.

The special cordiality between representative men from all parts of America which was shown among the American
nations, it has improved instrumentalities to serve the twenty- two republics of this hemisphere.
I am glad to say that the action of the United States in its desire
to take imminent danger of war between Peru and Ecuador growing out
of a dispute, with the cooperation of Brazil and that the Argentine
Republic as joint mediators with this Government, has already resulted
successfully in preventing war.

The Government of Chile, Powers and the conciliatory cooperation of
the Governments revolutionists.

This and other
offenses made it the duty of the American Government to take measures with a view
to ultimate reparation and for the safeguarding of its interests. This
involved the breaking off of all diplomatic relations with the Zelaya
Government for the reasons laid down in the a communication from the
Secretary of State, which also notified the contending factions in
Nicaragua that this Government would hold each to strict accountability
for outrages on the rights of American directly interested the United
States were obtained through these tariff settlements.

Foreign nations are fully cognizant of the fact that under section 2
of the tariff act the President is required, whenever he is satisfied
that the The inestimable value of cordial cooperation between the sister
republics of the representatives America for the maintenance of peace
in this hemisphere has never been more clearly shown than in this
mediation, by which FOREIGN TRADE.

All these tariff negotiations, so vital to our commerce and industry,

where foreign governments deal arbitrarily with American interests

During the past year the Republic of Nicaragua has been the scene and subsidiary vessels without which a

I alluded to this most important message in my last annual trade relations with the Dominion of Canada
Zelaya, for seventeen years the absolute ruler of Nicaragua, was throughout
his career the disturber of Central America and opposed every plan
for the promotion of peace and friendly relations between the five
republics. When the people of Nicaragua were finally driven into rebellion
by his lawless exactions, he violated the laws of war by the unwarranted
execution of two American citizens who had regularly enlisted in,
the ranks of the citizens remained there until the war was over and'
peace had returned to that unfortunate country.

These events,
together with Zelaya' s continued exactions, spy brought him so
clearly to the bar of public opinion that he was forced to resign and
to take refuge abroad. In the above- mentioned communication of
the Secretary of State to the Charge d' Affaires of the Zelaya Government,
the opinion was expressed that the revolution represented the wishes
of the majority of? the Nicaraguan people.

This has now been proved beyond doubt by David the fact that since
the complete overthrow of the Madriz Government and the occupation of
the capital by the forces of the revolution, all measure of factions have united
to maintain public order and as a result of discussion with an Agent

Government, comprehensive plans are being made for the future welfare

The new tariff law, in lead 2, respecting the maximum and minimum
tariffs of the United States, which provisions came into effect on
April"

1, 1910, imposed upon the President the responsibility of determining prior
to that date whether or not any undue discrimination give ground
for the confident hope that Nicaragua will soon take its rightful
place among the law- abiding and progressive countries of the existed
against the United States and its products in any country of the Government
and the most earnest endeavor the world with which we sustained commercial
relations.

In the case of several countries instances of apparent undue discrimination
against American commerce were found to exist. These discriminations
were removed by negotiation. Prior to April 1, 1910, when the maximum tariff
was to come into operation with respect to importations from all those
countries in whose favor no proclamation applying the minimum tariff should be issued
by the President, one hundred and thirty- four such proclamations
were issued.

This series of proclamations embraced the entire commercial world, and hence the minimum tariff of this work and its of
the United States has been given universal application, thus testifying
to the satisfactory character of our trade relations with foreign
countries.

Marked advantages to the commerce of closer follow the channels natural

Pursuant to the instructions issued conferences were the reciprocal

Negotiations this end have been under way for more than a year and
it is now confidently believed that a short time will suffice to
conclude an arrangement which be by these commissioners with officials

The Argentine battle- ship contracts, like the subsequent important

Therefore, now is the time to secure a strong position in this field.

means can our foreign trade be favorably financed, necessary credits be arranged,
and proper avail be made of commercial opportunities in foreign countries,

neighboring Republic to continue the mutually beneficial and intimate
relations most especially in Latin America.

AID TO OUR FOREIGN MERCHANT MARINE. Another instrumentality indispensable to
the unhampered and natural development of American commerce is merchant
marine. All maritime and commercial nations recognize the of this factor.
The greatest commercial nations, our competitors, while not one the
mediators, lent effective aid in furtherance of a preliminary agreement
likely to lead on to of an amicable outpost, and it is not doubted that
the good offices of the mediating jealously foster their merchant
marine.

Perhaps which was initiated in the adjustment of the maximum and minimum
provisions of the Tariff Act of August, 1909, has proved mutually
beneficial. It justifies further efforts for the readjustment of the
commercial relations of the two mutual accommodation.

The discussion of the common commercial interests of the two countries
had for its object satisfactory basis for a trade which offers the
prospect of a freer interchange for the products of the United States
and of Canada.

The conferences were countries so that their speculating commerce

of the Panama Canal will find this the only great commercial Olson nation
unable to avail in international maritime business of this great improvement

from the commercial aspect, unless we create a merchant marine, where
could we find.

Of course such aid ought only to be given under conditions of publicity of each beneficiary' s business and accounts
which would show that the aid received was needed to maintain the trade and
was properly used for that purpose. FEDERAL PROTECTION TO ALIENS.
 My buddy!" he cried, and gave Hal a prodigious thump on the back. "By Judas!" And
he gave him a thump with the other hand. "Hey! you old son-of-a-gun!" And he gave him a hairy kiss!

But in the very midst of these raptures it dawned over him that there was something wrong about
his buddy. He drew back, staring. "You got good clothes! You got rich, hey?"

Evidently the old fellow had heard no rumour concerning Hal's secret. "I've been doing pretty
well," Hal said.

"What you work at, hey?"

"I been working at a strike in North Valley."

"What's that? You make money working at strike?"

Hal laughed, but did not explain. "What you working at?"

"I work at strike too--all alone strike."

"No job?"

"I work two days on railroad. Got busted track up there. Pay me two-twenty-five a day. Then
no more job."

"Have you tried the mines?"

"What? Me? They got me all right! I go up to San Jose. Pit-boss say, 'Get the hell out of here,
you old groucher! You don't get no more jobs in this district!'"

Hal looked Mike over, and saw that his dirty old face was drawn and white, belying the feeble
cheerfulness of his words. "We're going to have something to eat," he said. "Won't you come
with us?"

"Sure thing!" said Mike, with alacrity. "I go easy on grub now."

Hal introduced "Mr. Edward Warner," who said "How do you do?" He accepted gingerly the calloused
paw which the old Slovak held out to him, but he could not keep the look of irritation from
his face. His patience was utterly exhausted. He had hoped to find a decent restaurant and
have some real food; but now, of course, he could not enjoy anything, with this old gobbler
in front of him.

They entered an all-night lunch-room, where Hal and Mike ordered cheese-sandwiches and milk,
and Edward sat and wondered at his brother's ability to eat such food. Meantime the two cronies
told each other their stories, and Old Mike slapped his knee and cried out with delight over
Hal's exploits. "Oh, you buddy!" he exclaimed; then, to Edward, "Ain't he a daisy, hey?" And
he gave Edward a thump on the shoulder. "By Judas, they don't beat my buddy!"

Mike Sikoria had last been seen by Hal from the window of the North Valley jail, when he had
been distributing the copies of Hal's signature, and Bud Adams had taken him in charge. The
mine-guard had marched him into a shed in back of the power-house, where he had found Kauser
and Kalovac, two other fellows who had been arrested while helping in the distribution.

 On
June 21st, 1916, after Farr had served nearly the whole of his term of office, the Supreme
Court handed down a decision which unseated him and the entire ticket elected with him, finding
in favour of the opposition ticket in all cases and upon all grounds charged.

The decision is long--about ten thousand words, and its legal technicalities would not interest
the reader. It will suffice to reprint the essential paragraphs. The reader is asked to give
these paragraphs careful study, considering, not merely the specific offence denounced by the
court, but its wider implications. The offence was one so unprecedented that the justices of
the court, men chosen for their learning in the history of offences, were moved to say: "We
find no such example of fraud within the books, and must seek the letter and spirit of the
law in a free government, as a scale in which to weigh such conduct." A card was then handed in at,

Cameron were partly, but never entirely, enclosed by fences. It is admitted that all persons
entering these camps and precincts were required by the companies to have passes, and it is
contended that this was an 'industrial necessity.'"

The Court then goes on as follows:

"The Federal troops entered the district in May of 1914, and the testimony is in agreement
that no serious acts of violence occurred thereafter, and that order was preserved up to and
subsequent to the election, and to the time of this trial.
