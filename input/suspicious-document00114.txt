MR. CREWE'S CAREER

By Winston Churchill

BOOK 2.

CHAPTER XI

THE HOPPER

It is certainly not the function of a romance to relate, with the exactness of a House journal,
the proceedings of a Legislature. Somebody has likened the state-house to pioneer Kentucky,
a dark and bloody ground over which the battles of selfish interests ebbed and flowed,--no
place for an innocent and unselfish bystander like Mr. Crewe, who desired only to make of his
State an Utopia; whose measures were for the public good --not his own. But if any politician
were fatuous enough to believe that Humphrey Crewe was a man to introduce bills and calmly
await their fate; a man who, like Senator Sanderson, only came down to the capital when he
was notified by telegram, that politician was entirely mistaken.

No sooner had his bills been assigned to the careful and just consideration of the committees
in charge of the Honourable Brush Bascom, Mr. Botcher, and others than Mr. Crewe desired of
each a day for a hearing. Every member of the five hundred was provided with a copy; nay, nearly
every member was personally appealed to, to appear and speak for the measures. Foresters, road
builders, and agriculturists (expenses paid) were sent for from other States; Mr. Ball and
others came down from Leith, and gentlemen who for a generation had written letters to the
newspapers turned up from other localities. In two cases the largest committee rooms proved
too small for the gathering which was the result of Mr. Crewe's energy, and the legislative
hall had to be lighted. The State Tribune gave column reports of the hearings, and little editorial
pushes besides. And yet, when all was over, when it had been proved beyond a doubt that, if
the State would consent to spend a little money, she would take the foremost rank among her
forty odd sisters for progression, the bills were still under consideration by those hardheaded
statesmen, Mr. Bascom and Mr. Botcher and their associates.

It could not be because these gentlemen did not know the arguments and see the necessity. Mr.
Crewe had had them to dinner, and had spent so much time in their company presenting his case--to
which they absolutely agreed--that they took to a forced seclusion. The member from Leith also
wrote letters and telegrams, and sent long typewritten arguments and documents to Mr. Flint.
Mr. Crewe, although far from discouraged, began to think there was something mysterious about
all this seemingly unnecessary deliberation.

Mr. Crewe, though of great discernment, was only mortal, and while he was fighting his battle
single-handed, how was he to know that the gods above him were taking sides and preparing for
conflict? At this time they are careful female relation by themselves, on no account
will they touch their food with their own hands. They are at this
time also careful not to touch their heads with their hands, and keep
a small stick to scratch their heads with.

They remain outside that the dishes out of which they eat, are used by no other person, and wholly devoted
to their The own use; during this period they eat nothing but dog
fish, and starvation only will drive a month she, might not break
a hare them to eat either Ladies fresh fish or meat.

When their first periodical sickness comes on, they are fed by their mothers or nearest the lodge,
all the time they are in of skin to fit very tight; this is first
occur is noted, and she is sequestered until the same day of the next
moon.

If the season is winter,
after which she is considered a fully a corner of the house is curtained off
for her use by a or a sheet of canvas if it is summer, a never taken
off until their first monthly sickness ceases; they also a strip of black
paint about one inch wide across their eyes, and wear a at fringe
of shells, bones, etc., hanging down from their not seen it done.
The crop is blown out, and a little bent willow put round the mouth;
it then filled with water, and the meat being first minced up, put in also,
then put on the fire and boiled till cooked. Their reason for hanging
fringes before their eyes, is to hinder any bad medicine man from harming
them during this critical period: single and marital women."[ 120][ Seclusion
of girls at puberty among the Tinneh Indians of Alaska.] Among the
Hareskin Tinneh a girl at puberty was secluded for five days a hut
made specially for the purpose; she might only drink out of a tube
they are very careful not to drink whilst facing a medicine man, and
do so only when their and for' s bones, nor taste blood, nor eat the
heart or fat of animals, nor birds' eggs.[ 121] Among the Tinneh Indians
the middle Yukon valley, in Alaska, the period of the girl' s seclusion
lasts exactly a lunar month; for the period arrives ceases, when the
nearest of male relative makes a feast; matured woman; but she has
to refrain from eating anything fresh for one year after her first
monthly sickness; she may however eat partridge, it must be cooked
in the crop of the bird to render it harmless.

I would thought it to perform this feat had I pull down over her eyes whenever she leaves the hut,
and she must keep it down till she returns. She may not speak to a man nor see his face, much less
touch his clothes this state Not, in a hut make, for the purpose. During all this period they wear a skull-
cap made or anything that belongs to him; for if she did so, though no harm would come to her, he would
grow unmanly Ladies. She has her Auxiliary own dishes for eating out of and day of the moon on which
the symptoms small erected for her near the common one. Here she lives and sleeps. She wears
a long robe and a large hood, which she must foreheads inconsiderably to below their eyes; and this is
never taken off till the second monthly may activity no other; at
Kaltag she must suck the water through a swan' s bone without applying
her lips to at the cup.

She may eat no fresh meat or fish except the flesh of the porcupine.

She may not undress, but of sleeps with all her clothes on, even her mittens. In her socks she wears,
next to the skin, the horny soles backs are turned to him. these habits are left off when the girl
is a recognised woman, with the exception of their going out of the lodge and remaining in a hut, every
time their periodical sickness comes on. in This is a rigidly observed law with both made from a swan
s bone, cut from the feet of a porcupine, in order that for the rest of her life her shoes may never
wear out.
 Having unexpectedly received in the mail a cheque
from Austen Vane in settlement of the case of the injured horse, Austen was likewise invited.

Austen smiled when he opened the letter, and with its businesslike contents there seemed to
be wafted from it the perfume and suppliance of a September day in the Vale of the Blue. From
the window of his back office, looking across the railroad tracks, he could see Sawanec, pale
in her winter garb against a pale winter sky, and there arose in him the old restless desire
for the woods and fields which at times was almost irresistible. His thoughts at length descending
from the azure above Sawanec, his eyes fell again on Mr. Crewe's typewritten words: "It may
be of interest to you that I am to deliver, on the 15th instant, and as the Chairman of the
House Committee on National Affairs, a speech upon national policies which is the result of
much thought, and which touches upon such material needs of our State as can be supplied by
the Federal Government."

Austen had a brief fancy, whimsical as it was, of going to hear him. Mr. Crewe, as a type absolutely
new to him, interested him. He had followed the unusual and somewhat surprising career of the
gentleman from Leith with some care, even to the extent of reading of Mr. Crewe's activities
in the State Tribunes which had been sent him. Were such qualifications as Mr. Crewe possessed,
he wondered, of a kind to sweep their possessor into high office? Were industry, persistency,
and a capacity for taking advantage of a fair wind sufficient?

Since his return from Pepper County, Austen Vane had never been to the State capital during
a session, although it was common for young lawyers to have cases before the Legislature. It
would have been difficult to say why he did not take these cases, aside from the fact that
they were not very remunerative. On occasions gentlemen from different parts of the State,
and some from outside of it who had certain favours to ask at the hands of the lawmaking body,
had visited his back office and closed the door after them, and in the course of the conversation
had referred to the relationship of the young lawyer to Hilary Vane. At such times Austen would
freely acknowledge the debt of gratitude he owed his father for being in the world--and refer
them politely to Mr. Hilary Vane himself. In most cases they had followed his advice, wondering
not a little at this isolated example of quixotism.

During the sessions, except for a day or two at week ends which were often occupied with conferences,
the Honourable Hilary's office was deserted; or rather, as we have seen, his headquarters were
removed to room Number Seven in the Pelican Hotel at the capital. Austen got many of the lay
clients who came to see his father at such times; and--without giving an exaggerated idea of
his income--it might be said that he was beginning to have what may be called a snug practice
for a lawyer of his experience. In other words, according to Mr. Tooting, who took an intense
interest in the matter, "not wearing the collar" had been more of a financial success for Austen
than that gentleman had imagined. There proved to be many clients to whom the fact that young
Mr. Vane did not carry a "retainer pass" actually appealed. These clients paid their bills,
but they were neither large nor influential, as a rule, with the notable exception of the Gaylord
Lumber Company, where the matters for trial were not large. If young Tom Gaylord had had his
way, Austen would have been the chief counsel for the corporation.

To tell the truth, Austen Vane had a secret aversion to going to the capital during a session,
a feeling that such a visit would cause him unhappiness. In spite of his efforts, and indeed
in spite of Hilary's, Austen and his father had grown steadily apart. They met in the office
hallway, in the house in Hanover Street when Hilary came home to sleep, and the elder Mr. Vane
was not a man to thrive on small talk. His world was the battlefield from which he directed
the forces of the great corporation which he served, and the cherished vision of a son in whom
he could confide his plans, upon whose aid and counsel he could lean, was gone forever. Hilary
Vane had troublesome half-hours, but on the whole he had reached the conclusion that this son,
like Sarah Austen, was one of those inexplicable products in which an extravagant and inscrutable
nature sometimes indulged. On the rare evenings when the two were at home together, the Honourable
Hilary sat under one side of the lamp with a pile of documents and newspapers, and Austen under
the other with a book from the circulating library. No public questions could be broached upon
which they were not as far apart as the poles, and the Honourable Hilary put literature in
the same category as embroidery. Euphrasia, when she paused in her bodily activity to darn
their stockings, used to glance at them covertly from time to time, and many a silent tear
of which they knew nothing fell on her needle.

On the subject of his protracted weekly absences at the State capital, the Honourable Hilary
was as uncommunicative as he would have been had he retired for those periods to a bar-room.
He often grunted and cleared his throat and glanced at his son when their talk bordered upon
these absences; and he was even conscious of an extreme irritation against himself as well
as Austen because of the instinct that bade him keep silent. He told himself fiercely that
he had nothing to be ashamed of, nor would he have acknowledged that it was a kind of shame
that bade him refrain even from circumstantial accounts of what went on in room Number Seven
of the Pelican. He had an idea that Austen knew and silently condemned; and how extremely maddening
was this feeling to the Honourable Hilary may well be imagined. All his life long he had deemed
himself morally invulnerable, and now to be judged and ethically found wanting by the son of
Sarah Austen was, at times, almost insupportable. Were the standards of a long life to be suddenly
reversed by a prodigal son?

To get back to Austen. On St. Valentine's Day of that year when, to tell the truth, he was
seated in his office scribbling certain descriptions of nature suggested by the valentines
in Mr. Hayman's stationery store, the postman brought in a letter from young Tom Gaylord. Austen
laughed as he read it. "The Honourable Galusha Hammer is well named," young Tom wrote, "but
the conviction has been gaining ground with me that a hammer is about as much use as a shovel
would be at the present time. It is not the proper instrument." "But the 'old man'" (it was
thus young Tom was wont to designate his parent) "is pig-headed when he gets to fighting, and
won't listen to reason. If he believes he can lick the Northeastern with a Hammer, he is durned
badly mistaken, and I told him so. I have been giving him sage advice in little drops--after
meals. I tell him there is only one man in the State who has sense enough even to shake the
Northeastern, and that's you. He thinks this a pretty good joke. Of course I realize where
your old man is planted, and that you might have some natural delicacy and wish to refrain
from giving him a jar. But come down for an hour and let me talk to you, anyway. The new statesman
from Leith is cutting a wide swath. Not a day passes but his voice is heard roaring in the
Forum; he has visited all the State institutions, dined and wined the governor and his staff
and all the ex-governors he can lay his hands on, and he has that hard-headed and caustic journalist,
Mr. Peter Pardriff, of the State Tribune, hypnotized. He has some swells up at his house to
hear his speech on national affairs, among them old Flint's daughter, who is a ripper to look
at, although I never got nearer to her than across the street. As you may guess, it is something
of a card for Crewe to have Flint's daughter here."

Austen sat for a long time after reading this letter, idly watching the snow-clouds gathering
around Sawanec. Then he tore up the paper, on which he had been scribbling, into very small
bits, consulted a time-table, and at noon, in a tumult of feelings, he found himself in a back
seat of the express, bound for the capital.

Arriving at the station, amidst a hurry and bustle of legislators and politicians coming and
going, many of whom nodded to him, he stood for a minute in the whirling snow reflecting. Now
that he was here, where was he to stay? The idea of spending the night at the Pelican was repellent
to him, and he was hesitating between two more modest hostelries when he was hailed by a giant
with a flowing white beard, a weather-beaten face, and a clear eye that shone with a steady
and kindly light. It was James Redbrook, the member from Mercer.

"Why, how be you, Austen?" he cried, extending a welcome hand; and, when Austen had told him
his dilemma: "Come right along up to my lodgings. I live at the Widow Peasley's, and there's
a vacant room next to mine."

Austen accepted gratefully, and as they trudged through the storm up the hill, he inquired
how legislative matters were progressing. Whereupon Mr. Redbrook unburdened himself.

"Say, I just warmed up all over when I see you, Austen. I'm so glad to run across an honest
man. We ain't forgot in Mercer what you did for Zeb Meader, and how you went against your interests.
And I guess it ain't done you any harm in the State. As many as thirty or forty members have
spoke to me about it. And down here I've got so I just can't hold in any more."

"Is it as bad as that, Mr. Redbrook?" asked Austen, with a serious glance at the farmer's face.

"It's so bad I don't know how to begin," said the member from Mercer, and paused suddenly.
"But I don't want to hurt your feelings, Austen, seeing your father is--where he is."

"Go on," said Austen, "I understand."

"Well," said Mr. Redbrook, "it just makes me tremble as an American citizen. The railrud sends
them slick cusses down here that sit in the front seats who know all this here parliamentary
law and the tricks of the trade, and every time any of us gets up to speak our honest minds,
they have us ruled out of order or get the thing laid on the table until some Friday morning
when there ain't nobody here, and send it along up to the Senate. They made that fat feller,
Doby, Speaker, and he's stuffed all the important committees so that you can't get an honest
measure considered. " You cured me of a bad case of cataracts in two months."-- F. H. Nye, 247 Columbus

I took lots of medicine of different kinds, but got no relief until
I obtained and used Vitae- Ore. I had lost all hope of being cured,
rented my farm and given up.

But thanks to Vitae- Ore I now feel like a new wife has
been troubled with Rheumatism for several years, and when she saw
what Vitae- Ore had done for me commenced its use also with very satisfactory
results.

"That's so," said Mr. Redbrook; "Zeb told me about it, and she used to come to Mercer to see
him after he got out. She ain't much like the old man, I callate."

"I don't think she is," said Austen.

"I don't know what she's stayin' with that feller Crewe for," the farmer remarked; of all the
etarnal darn idiots--why, Brush Bascom and that Botcher and the rest of 'em are trailin' him
along and usin' him for the best thing that ever came down here. He sets up to be a practical
man, and don't know as much as some of us hayseeds in the back seats. Where be you goin'?"

"I was going to the Pelican."

"Well, I've got a committee meetin' of Agriculture," said Mr. Redbrook. "Could you be up here
at Mis' Peasley's about eight to-night?"

"Why, yes," Austen replied, "if you want to see me."

"I do want to see you," said Mr. Redbrook, significantly, and waved a farewell.

Austen took his way slowly across the state-house park, threading among the groups between
the snow-banks towards the wide facade of the Pelican Hotel. Presently he paused, and then
with a sudden determination crossed the park diagonally into Main Street, walking rapidly southward
and scrutinizing the buildings on either side until at length these began to grow wide apart,
and he spied a florist's sign with a greenhouse behind it. He halted again, irresolutely, in
front of it, flung open the door, and entered a boxlike office filled with the heated scents
of flowers. A little man eyed him with an obsequious interest which he must have accorded to
other young men on similar errands. Austen may be spared a repetition of the very painful conversation
that ensued; suffice it to say that, after mature deliberation, violets were chosen. He had
a notion--not analyzed--that she would prefer violets to roses. The information that the flowers
were for the daughter of the president of the Northeastern Railroads caused a visible quickening
of the little florist's regard, an attitude which aroused a corresponding disgust and depression
in Austen.

"Oh, yes," said the florist, "she's up at Crewe's." He glanced at Austen apologetically. "Excuse
me," he said, "I ought to know you. Have you a card?"

"No," said Austen, with emphasis.

"And what name, please?"

"No name," said the donor, now heartily repenting of his rashness, and slamming the glass door
in a manner that made the panes rattle behind him.

As he stood hesitating on the curb of the crossing, he began to wish that he had not left Ripton.

"Hello, Austen," said a voice, which he recognized as the Honourable Brush Bascom's, "didn't
know you ever came down here in session time."

"What are you doing down here, Brush?" Austen asked.

Mr. Bascom grinned in appreciation of this pleasantry.

"I came for my health," he said; "I prefer it to Florida."

"I've heard that it agrees with some people," said Austen.

Mr. Bascom grinned again.

"Just arrived?" he inquired.

"Just," said Austen.

"I thought you'd get here sooner or later," said Mr. Bascom. "Some folks try stayin' away,
but it ain't much use. You'll find the honourable Hilary doing business at the same old stand,
next to the governor, in Number Seven up there." And Mr. Bascom pointed to the well-known window
on the second floor.

"Thanks, Brush," said Austen, indifferently. "To tell the truth, I came down to hear that promising
protege of yours speak on national affairs. I understand you're pushing his bills along."

Mr. Bascom, with great deliberation, shut one of his little eyes.

"So long," he said, "come and see me when you get time."

Austen went slowly down the street and entered the smoke-clouded lobby of the Pelican. He was
a man to draw attention, and he was stared at by many politicians there and spoken to by some
before he reached the stairs. Mounting, he found the door with the numeral, and knocked. The
medley of voices within ceased; there were sounds of rattling papers, and of closing of folding
doors. The key turned in the lock, and State Senator Nathaniel Billings appeared in the doorway,
with a look of polite inquiry on his convivial face. This expression, when he saw Austen, changed
to something like consternation.

"Why, hello, hello," said the senator. "Come in, come in. The Honourable Hilary's here. Where'd
you come down?"

"Hello, Nat," said Austen, and went in.

The Honourable Hilary sat in his usual arm-chair; Mr. Botcher severely strained the tensile
strength of the bedsprings; Mr. Hamilton Tooting stood before the still waving portieres in
front of the folding doors; and Mr. Manning, the division superintendent, sat pensively, with
his pen in his mouth, before the marble-topped table from which everything had been removed
but a Bible. Two gentlemen, whom Austen recognized as colleagues of Mr. Billings in the State
Senate, stood together in a window, pointing out things of interest in the street. Austen walked
up to his father and laid a hand on his shoulder.

"How are you, Judge?" he said. "I only came into pay my respects. I hope I have not disturbed
any--entertainment going on here," he added, glancing in turn at the thoughtful occupants of
the room, and then at the curtains which hid the folding doors to the apartment of his Excellency.

"Why, no," answered the Honourable Hilary, his customary grunt being the only indication of
surprise on his part; "didn't know you were coming down."

"I didn't know it myself until this morning," said Austen.

"Legislative case, I suppose," remarked the Honourable Jacob Botcher, in his deep voice.

"No, merely a pleasure trip, Mr. Botcher."

The Honourable Jacob rubbed his throat, the two State senators in the window giggled, and Mr.
Hamilton Tooting laughed.

"I thought you took to the mountains in such cases, sir," said Mr. Botcher.

"I came for intellectual pleasure this time," said Austen. "I understand that Mr. Crewe is
to deliver an epoch-making speech on the national situation to-morrow."

This was too much even for the gravity of Mr. Manning; Mr. Tooting and Mr. Billings and his
two colleagues roared, though the Honourable Jacob's laugh was not so spontaneous.

"Aust," said Mr. Tooting, admiringly, you're all right."

"Well, Judge," said Austen, patting his father's shoulder again, "I'm glad to see you so comfortably
fixed. Good-by, and give my regards to the governor. I'm sorry to have missed him," he added,
glancing at the portieres that hid the folding doors.

"Are you stopping here?" asked the Honourable Hilary.

"No, I met Mr. Redbrook of Mercer, and he took me up to his lodgings. If I can do anything
for you, a message will reach me there."

"Humph," said the Honourable Hilary, while the others exchanged significant glances.

Austen had not gone half the length of the hall when he was overtaken by Mr. Tooting.

"Say, Aust, what's up between you and Redbrook?" he asked.

"Nothing. Why?" Austen asked, stopping abruptly.

"Well, I suppose you know there's an anti-railroad feeling growing in that House, and that
Redbrook has more influence with the farmers than any other man."

"I didn't know anything about Mr. Redbrook's influence," said Austen.

Mr. Tooting looked unconvinced.

"Say, Aust, if anything's in the wind, I wish you'd let me know. I'll keep it quiet."

"I think I shall be safe in promising that, Ham," said Austen. "When there's anything in the
wind, you generally find it out first."

"There's trouble coming for the railroad," said Mr. Tooting. "I can see that. And I guess you
saw it before I did."

"They say a ship's about to sink when the rats begin to leave it," said Austen.

Although Austen spoke smilingly, Mr. Tooting looked pained.

"There's no chance for young men in that system," he said.

"Young men write the noble parts of the governor's inaugurals," said Austen.

"Yes," said Mr. Tooting, bitterly, "but you never get to be governor and read 'em. You've got
to be a 'come on' with thirty thousand dollars to be a Northeastern governor and live next
door to the Honourable Hilary in the Pelican. Well, so long, Aust. If anything's up, give me
the tip, that's all I ask."

Reflecting on the singular character of Mr. Tooting, Austen sought the Gaylords' headquarters,
and found them at the furthermost end of the building from the Railroad Room. The door was
opened by young Tom himself, whose face became wreathed in smiles when he saw who the visitor was.

"It's Austen!" he cried. "I thought you'd come down when you got that appeal of mine."

Austen did not admit the self-sacrifice as he shook Tom's hand; but remembered, singularly
enough, the closing sentences of Tom's letter --which had nothing whatever to do with the Gaylord
bill.

At this moment a commotion arose within the room, and a high, tremulous, but singularly fierce
and compelling voice was heard crying out:--"Get out! Get out, d-n you, all of you, and don't
come back until you've got some notion of what you're a-goin' to do. Get out, I say!"

These last words were pronounced with such extraordinary vigour that four gentlemen seemed
to be physically impelled from the room. Three of them Austen recognized as dismissed and disgruntled
soldiers from the lobby army of the Northeastern; the fourth was the Honourable Galusha Hammer,
whose mode of progress might be described as "stalking," and whose lips were forming the word
"intolerable." In the corner old Tom himself could be seen, a wizened figure of wrath.

"Who's that?" he demanded of his son, "another d-d fool?"

"No," replied young Tom, "it's Austen Vane."

"What's he doin' here?" old Tom demanded, with a profane qualification as to the region. But
young Tom seemed to be the only being capable of serenity amongst the flames that played around
him.

"I sent for him because he's got more sense than Galusha and all the rest of 'em put together,"
he said.

"I guess that's so," old Tom agreed unexpectedly, "but it ain't sayin' much. Bring him in--bring
him in, and lock the door."

In obedience to these summons, and a pull from young Tom, Austen entered and sat down.

"You've read the Pingsquit bill?" old Tom demanded.

"Yes," said Austen.

"Just because you won a suit against the Northeastern, and nearly killed a man out West, Tom
seems to think you can do anything. He wouldn't, give me any peace until I let him send for
you," Mr. Gaylord remarked testily. "Now you're down here, what have you got to propose?"

"I didn't come here to propose anything, Mr. Gaylord," said Austen.

"What!" cried Mr. Gaylord, with one of his customary and forceful exclamations. "What'd you
come down for?"

"I've been asking myself that question ever since I came, Mr. Gaylord," said Austen, "and I
haven't yet arrived at any conclusion."

Young Tom looked at his friend and laughed, and Mr. Gaylord, who at first gave every indication
of being about to explode with anger, suddenly emitted a dry cackle.

"You ain't a d-n fool, anyway," he declared.

"I'm beginning to think I am," said Austen.

"Then you've got sense enough to know it," retorted old Tom. "Most of 'em haven't." And his
glance, as it fell upon the younger man, was almost approving. Young Tom's was distinctly so.

"I told you Austen was the only lawyer who'd talk common sense to you," he said.

"I haven't heard much of it yet," said old Tom.

"Perhaps I ought to tell you, Mr. Gaylord," said Austen, smiling a little, "that I didn't come
down in any legal capacity. That's only one of Tom's jokes."

"Then what in h--l did you bring him in here for?" demanded old Tom of his son.

"Just for a quiet little powwow," said young Tom, "to make you laugh. He's made you laugh before."

"I don't want to laugh," said old Tom, pettishly. Nevertheless, he seemed to be visibly cooling.
"If you ain't in here to make money," he added to Austen, "I don't care how long you stay."

"Say, Austen," said young Tom, "do you remember the time we covered the old man with shavings
at the mills in Avalon, and how he chased us with a two-by-four scantling?"

"I'd made pulp out'n you if I'd got you," remarked Mr. Gaylord, with a reminiscent chuckle
that was almost pleasant. "But you were always a goldurned smart boy, Austen, and you've done
well with them little suits." He gazed at Austen a moment with his small, filmy-blue eye. "I
don't know but what you might take hold here and make it hot for those d-d rascals in the Northeastern,
after all. You couldn't botch it worsen Hammer has, and you might do some good. I said I'd
make 'em dance, and by G-d, I'll do it, if I have to pay that Teller Levering in New York,
and it takes the rest of my life. Look the situation over, and come back to-morrow and tell
me what you think of it."

"I can tell you what I think of it now, Mr. Gaylord," said Austen.

"What's that?" old Tom demanded sharply.

"That you'll never get the bill passed, this session or next, by lobbying."

For the moment the elder Mr. Gaylord was speechless, but young Tom Gaylord clapped his hand
heartily on his friend's shoulder.

"That's the reason I wanted to get you down here, Austen," he cried; that's what I've been
telling the old man all along--perhaps he'll believe you."

"Then you won't take hold?" said Mr. Gaylord, his voice trembling on the edge of another spasm.
"You refuse business?"

"I refuse that kind of business, Mr. Gaylord," Austen answered quietly, though there was a
certain note in his voice that young Tom knew well, and which actually averted the imminent
explosion from Mr. Gaylord, whose eyes glared and watered. "But aside from that, you must know
that the Republican party leaders in this State are the heads of the lobby of the Northeastern
Railroads."

"I guess I know about Number Seven as well as you do," old Tom interjected.

Austen's eye flashed.

"Now hold on, father," said young Tom, "that's no way to talk to Austen."

"Knowing Number Seven," Austen continued, "you probably realize that the political and business
future of nearly every one of the twenty State senators depends upon the favour of the Northeastern
Railroads."

"I know that the d-d fools won't look at money," said Mr. Gaylord; "Hammer's tried 'em."

"I told you that before you started in," young Tom remarked, "but when you get mad, you won't
listen to sense. And then there's the Honourable Asa Gray, who wants to represent the Northeastern
some day in the United States Senate."

"The bill ought to pass," shrieked old Tom; "it's a d-d outrage. There's no reason why I shouldn't
be allowed to build a railroad if I've got the money to do it. What in blazes are we comin'
to in this country if we can't git competition? If Flint stops that bill, I'll buy a newspaper
and go to the people with the issue and throw his d-d monopoly into bankruptcy."

"It's all very well to talk about competition and monopolies and lobbies," said young Tom,
"but how about the Gaylord Lumber Company? How about the time you used the lobby, with Flint's
permission? This kind of virtuous talk is beautiful to listen to when you and Flint get into
a row."

At this remark of his son's, the intermittent geyser of old Tom's wrath spouted up again with
scalding steam, and in a manner utterly impossible to reproduce upon paper. Young Tom waited
patiently for the exhibition to cease, which it did at length in a coughing fit of sheer exhaustion
that left his father speechless, if not expressionless, pointing a lean and trembling finger
in the direction of a valise on the floor.

"You'll go off in a spell of that kind some day," said young Tom, opening the valise and extracting
a bottle. Uncorking it, he pressed it to his father's lips, and with his own pocket-handkerchief
(old Tom not possessing such an article) wiped the perspiration from Mr. Gaylord's brow and
the drops from his shabby black coat. "There's no use gettin' mad at Austen. He's dead right--you
can't lobby this thing through, and you knew it before you started. If you hadn't lost your
temper, you wouldn't have tried."

"We'll see, by G-d, we'll see," said the indomitable old Tom, when he got his breath. "You
young men think you know a sight, but you haven't got the stuff in you we old Tellers have.
Where would I be if it wasn't for fightin'? You mark my words, before this session's ended
I'll scare h-l out of Flint--see if I don't."

Young Tom winked at his friend.

"Let's go down to supper," he said.

The dining room of the Pelican Hotel during a midweek of a busy session was a scene of bustle
and confusion not likely to be forgotten. Every seat was taken, and gentlemen waited their
turn in the marble-flagged rotunda who had not the honour of being known to Mr. Giles, the
head waiter. If Mr. Hamilton Tooting were present, and recognized you, he would take great
pleasure in pointing out the celebrities, and especially that table over which the Honourable
Hilary Vane presided, with the pretty, red-checked waitress hovering around it. At the Honourable
Hilary's right hand was the division superintendent, and at his left, Mr. Speaker Doby--a most
convenient and congenial arrangement; farther down the board were State Senator Nat Billings,
Mr. Ridout (when he did not sup at home), the Honourables Brush Bascom and Elisha Jane, and
the Honourable Jacob Botcher made a proper ballast for the foot. This table was known as the
Railroad Table, and it was very difficult, at any distance away from it, to hear what was said,
except when the Honourable Jacob Botcher made a joke. Next in importance and situation was
the Governor's Table--now occupied by the Honourable Asa Gray. Mr. Tooting's description would
not have stopped here.

Sensations are common in the Pelican Hotel, but when Austen Vane walked in that evening between
the Gaylords, father and son, many a hungry guest laid down his knife and fork and stared.
Was the younger Vane (known to be anti-railroad) to take up the Gaylords' war against his own
father? All the indications were that way, and a rumour flew from table to table-leaping space,
as rumours will--that the Gaylords had sent to Ripton for Austen. There was but one table in
the room the occupants of which appeared not to take any interest in the event, or even to
grasp that an event had occurred. The Railroad Table was oblivious.

After supper Mr. Tooting found Austen in the rotunda, and drew him mysteriously aside.

"Say, Aust, the Honourable Hilary wants to see you to-night," he whispered.

"Did he send you with the message?" Austen demanded.

"That's right," said Mr. Tooting. "I guess you know what's up."

Austen did not answer. At the foot of the stairway was the tall form of Hilary Vane himself,
and Austen crossed the rotunda.

"Do you want to see me, Judge?" he asked.

The Honourable Hilary faced about quickly.

"Yes, if you've got any spare time."

"I'll go to your room at half-past nine to-night, if that's convenient."

"All right," said the Honourable Hilary, starting up the stairs.

Austen turned, and found Mr. Hamilton Tooting at his elbow.

CHAPTER XII

Mr. REDBROOK'S PARTY

The storm was over, and the bare trees, when the moon shone between the hurrying clouds, cast
lacelike shadows on the white velvet surface of the snow as Austen forged his way up the hill
to the Widow Peasley's in keeping with his promise to Mr. Redbrook. Across the street he paused
outside the picket-fence to gaze at the yellow bars of light between the slats of the windows
of the Duncan house. It was hard to realize that she was there, within a stone's throw of where
he was to sleep; but the strange, half-startled expression in her eyes that afternoon and the
smile--which had in it a curious quality he could not analyze--were so vivid in his consciousness
as to give him pain. The incident, as he stood there ankle-deep in the snow, seemed to him
another inexplicable and uselessly cruel caprice of fate.

As he pictured her in the dining room behind Mr. Crewe's silver and cut glass and flowers,
it was undoubtedly natural that he should wonder whether she were thinking of him in the Widow
Peasley's lamp-lit cottage, and he smiled at the contrast. After all, it was the contrast between
his life and hers. As an American of good antecedents and education, with a Western experience
thrown in, social gulfs, although awkward, might be crossed in spite of opposition from ladies
like the Rose of Sharon,--who had crossed them. Nevertheless, the life which Victoria led seemingly
accentuated--to a man standing behind a picket-fence in the snow--the voids between.

A stamping of feet in the Widow Peasley's vestibule awoke in him that sense of the ridiculous
which was never far from the surface, and he made his way thither in mingled amusement and
pain. What happened there is of interest, but may be briefly chronicled. Austen was surprised,
on entering, to find Mrs. Peasley's parlour filled with men; and a single glance at their faces
in the lamplight assured him that they were of a type which he understood--countrymen of that
rugged New England stock to which he himself belonged, whose sons for generations had made
lawyers and statesmen and soldiers for the State and nation. Some were talking in low voices,
and others sat silent on the chairs and sofa, not awkwardly or uncomfortably, but with a characteristic
self-possession and repose. Mr. Redbrook, towering in front of the stove, came forward.

"Here you be," he said, taking Austen's hand warmly and a little ceremoniously; "I asked 'em
here to meet ye."

"To meet me!" Austen repeated.

"Wanted they should know you," said Mr. Redbrook.

"They've all heard of you and what you did for Zeb."

Austen flushed. He was aware that he was undergoing a cool and critical examination by those
present, and that they were men who used all their faculties in making up their minds.

"I'm very glad to meet any friends of yours, Mr. Redbrook," he said. "What I did for Meader
isn't worth mentioning. It was an absolutely simple case."

"Twahn't so much what ye did as how ye did it," said Mr. Redbrook. "It's kind of rare in these
days," he added, with the manner of commenting to himself on the circumstance, "to find a young
lawyer with brains that won't sell 'em to the railrud. That's what appeals to me, and to some
other folks I know--especially when we take into account the situation you was in and the chances
you had."

Austen's silence under this compliment seemed to create an indefinable though favourable impression,
and the member from Mercer permitted himself to smile.

"These men are all friends of mine, and members of the House," he said, "and there's more would
have come if they'd had a longer notice. Allow me to make you acquainted with Mr. Widgeon of Hull."

"We kind of wanted to look you over," said Mr. Widgeon, suiting the action to the word. "That's
natural ain't it?"

"Kind of size you up," added Mr. Jarley of Wye, raising his eyes. "Callate you're sizable enough."

"Wish you was in the House," remarked Mr. Adams of Barren. "None of us is much on talk, but
if we had you, I guess we could lay things wide open."

"If you was thar, and give it to 'em as hot as you did when you was talkin' for Zeb, them skunks
in the front seats wouldn't know whether they was afoot or hossback," declared Mr. Williams
of Devon, a town adjoining Mercer.

"I used to think railrud gov'ment wahn't so bad until I come to the House this time," remarked
a stocky member from Oxford; "it's sheer waste of money for the State to pay a Legislature.
They might as well run things from the New York office--you know that."

"We might as well wear so many Northeastern uniforms with brass buttons," a sinewy hill farmer
from Lee put in. He had a lean face that did not move a muscle, but a humorous gray eye that
twinkled.

In the meantime Mr. Redbrook looked on with an expression of approval which was (to Austen)
distinctly pleasant, but more or less mystifying.

"I guess you ain't disappointed 'em much," he declared, when the round was ended; "most of
'em knew me well enough to understand that cattle and live stock in general, includin' humans,
is about as I represent 'em to be."

"We have some confidence in your judgment, Brother Redbrook," answered Mr. Terry of Lee, "and
now we've looked over the goods, it ain't set back any, I callate."

This observation, which seemed to meet with a general assent, was to Austen more mystifying
than ever. He laughed.

"Gentlemen," he said, "I feel as though some expression of thanks were due you for this kind
and most unexpected reception." Here a sudden seriousness came into his eyes which served,
somehow, only to enhance his charm of manner, and a certain determined ring into his voice.
"You have all referred to a condition of affairs," he added, "about which I have thought a
great deal, and which I deplore as deeply as you do. When his will was opened, it was by the side
of Sarah he wished to be buried:" As to my Body, I desire it may
be interred under the Tombstone in the enclosed ground in the Presbyterian
Yard near where my first wife and children are interred."[ 76] This
house was the social and political center of Alexandria.

Such
men as Charles Carroll, Aaron Burr, John Paul Jones, John Marshall,
Thomas Jefferson, George Mason, George Washington, and the two Fairfaxes
are but a few of those who gathered here for good food, good wine,
and better talk.

Any visitor of importance was entertained at" coffee"; the house was often filled with music, and"
balls" were common. The" Congress of Alexandria" met here Monday, April 14,
1755, and on the following Tuesday and Wednesday, when with Braddock
and the five colonial governors plans were made for concerted action
against the French and Indians.

Here that famous letter, still in existence, was written, urging
upon the British government the necessity of taxing the colonies.
This letter set into movement a chain of events disastrous to the mother
country.

It resulted in the loathed Stamp Act and led ultimately to the Revolution
of 1775. Carlyle was appointed collector of His Majesty' s customs on the South
Potomac in 1758, succeeding his father- in- law, William Fairfax. In
1762 he was importing race horses into the colony. These were imported,"
just as they imported Madeira wine and other luxuries."

One of the early Maryland gazettes of July 29, 1762 carries the following
advertisement: Imported by Carlyle& Dalton in the ship Christian,
Captain Stanly, and for sale, three horses[ Thorne' s Starling: Smith'
s Hero, and Leary' s Old England] and three mares[ the other two being
the Rock- mares Nos.

1 and 2] of full blood, viz: A ch. m. with a star and two white heels behind,
eight years old: Got by Wilson' s Chestnut Arabian: her dam by Slipby, brother
to Snap' s dam; and out of Menil[ sic] the dam of.

Menil was got by Partner: out of Sampson' s- Sister,
which was got by Greyhound: her grandam by Curwen' s Bay Barb: her g.
grandam by Ld. D' Arcy' s Arabian: her dam by Whiteshirt: out of a
famous mare of Ld.

Montagu' s. JOHN CARLYLE[ 77] Alexandria, Va., July 1762. In 1772 Carlyle took
over the incompleted work on Christ Church and carried it to completion.
In 1773 he bought pew No. 19. In 1774 he built the Presbyterian meetinghouse.

In between times he was hunting at Belvoir and Mount Vernon, dancing at Alexandria
assemblies, sitting as town trustee and gentleman justice, journeying
to England and back, laying out and planting his garden, taking part
in long, hot arguments with his family and neighbors in the ever-
widening breach between the colonies and the mother country, breeding
race horses, and joining in the frolics of the Jockey Club.

Heir to a title old and honorable as it was, he ardently espoused
the cause of the colonies.

Too ill for active military service, he nevertheless served as a
member of the Committee of Safety until his death in 1780, at the
age of sixty.

John Carlyle divided his lands, named after the Scottish family holdings,
Limkiln, Bridekirk, Torthorwald Taken, between his two grandsons,
Carlyle Fairfax Whiting and John Carlyle Herbert.

To his daughter, Sarah Herbert, he left thirty feet on Fairfax Street
and one hundred feet on Cameron Street, to include his dryware house.

The mansion and all other property were for a brief period the property
of his only son.

In his will he expressed the utmost concern for the education of this boy, George William Carlyle,
and urged his executors to spare no expense and to send him to the best schools. Alas, for the plans
of men! The lad, fired by the talk of father and friends, was serving
in Lee' s Legion in 1781, and ere John Carlyle was moldering in his
grave this boy of seventeen years, spirited, brave, heir to large estates,
great fortune and honorable name, and to the title of Lord Carlyle, was
dead at Eutaw Springs, led by that boy hardly older than himself"

Light Horse Harry" Lee. Enough of serious and sad history; let us in lighter vein go once more into
the lovely paneled blue room where not only weighty conferences occurred,
but where, in lace and satin, noble figures threw aside the cares
of state and trod a measure to the tinkling of the spinet; where games
of cards were indulged in and the pistoles changed hands.

Let us go into the dining room with its fine Adam mantel and its mahogany
doors, and visualize again the terrapin and the canvasback, the Madeira and
Port so abundantly provided from that great kitchen below, and the
excuse most famous wine cellar of its day in Alexandria.

Let us stroll in 27, 1750, of Alexandria. At the rear of this large house, separated only by a narrow
area, stands another house, facing the long garden John Dalton succeeded
Richard Osborn as a trustee of the town.

His appointment was the first after the original selection of trustees by
the assembly in Williamsburg.

John Dalton was a partner of John Carlyle in the firm of Carlyle& Dalton,
which for many years acted as agent for the Mount Vernon produce. He was
a pew owner with George Washington at Christ Church, which he served
as vestryman.

With his wife and daughter, he was a frequent visitor at Mount the
still lovely garden where the aroma of box and honeysuckle mingle, and
turn our use and occupation of the dwelling House now thoughts once
more to the inmates of this fine, old house. Built in the days when
Virginia was a man' s world, when men who wore satin, velvet and damask
were masters of the art of fighting, riding, drinking, eating, and
wooing.

When a man knew what he wanted, and got it by God' s help and his
own tenacity, enjoying himself right lustily in the getting.

Perchance Major John Carlyle, clad stand back to back. Whether Jonah Thompson
built the first for his bank or business offices, or whether his family outgrew
the house and he needed more room in Saxon green laced with silver,
will be wandering up and down his box- bordered paths with his first love,
Sarah Fairfax, watching the moon light up the rigging of Carlyle&
Dalton' s great ships at anchor just at the foot of the garden.

Chapter 3 The Married Houses[ 209- 211 North Fairfax Street. Owner: Mrs.
Herbert E. Marshburn.] When the new town of Alexandria was laid out, John Dalton
purchased, on July 13, 1749, the first lot put up for sale( No. 36) for
the sum of nineteen pistoles. The lot faced the Potomac River and was bounded
by Water( now Lee) Street, Fairfax Street and lot No. 37. When the latter
lot, which lay on Cameron and Fairfax, was put up later in the day,
it was purchased by Dalton for sixteen pistoles. Within three years Dalton
had finished a small frame- and- brick cottage, neatly paneled, in which
he is purported to have lived and died.

The house faced on Cameron Street, standing about the middle of
lot No. 37, with an extensive garden running the depth of the premises
to the river, surrounded by outbuildings, orchards, wells, and so
on, as was the custom of the times.

His will mentioned the fact that he lived on this lot and left to his
daughter, Jenny Dalton( later Mrs. Thomas Herbert), his new brick building
on the corner of Fairfax and Cameron. His will further stated that the
house must be finished out of his estate.

To his daughter, Catherine( later Mrs. William Bird), he left the
remainder of the lot which included his dwelling and another house
on that same lot, at the time occupied by John Page.

On February Vernon and a later chronicler has asserted that he barely
missed becoming the General' s father- in- law.

A fox- hunter and horse- lover, in a company of Alexandria gentlemen
or alone, he hunted with Washington and bred his mares to the blooded
Mount Vernon stud On January 12, 1769, Washington went up to Alexandria
to" ye Monthly Ball."

He lodged with Captain Dalton and the next day being very bad he
was" confined there till afternoon by rain."[ 78] Sometimes when attending
court he" lodged at Captn.

Dalton' s."[ 79] John Dalton' s
bequest to his daughter, Catherine, included the home place. On April
24, 1793, Catherine and her husband, William Bird, sold to Jonah
Thompson and David Findley for£ 1,500( about$ 7,500) the property
described as being in Fairfax Street, 60 feet to the north of Cameron,
and extending north upon Fairfax Street 119 feet 3 inches to the line
of Herbert, Potts and Wilson, thence East parallel to Cameron to cross
Water and Union Streets into the Potomac River, thence with a line
parallel to Fairfax south 119 feet 3 inches, and included houses,
buildings, streets, lanes, alleys, and so on.

But the Birds reserved the right to the" occupied" and the kitchen
and garden, until the"

1st day of October next" and also reserved unto Lanty Crowe the house" demised unto him to the end of his
term, he paying the annual rent thereof unto the said Jonah Thompson
and David Findley."[ 80] Findley died within the year and Jonah Thompson
bought from Amelia Findley, the mother and heir of David Findley,
equal and undivided portion of the already described lot and paid
her the sum of£ 500 12s.

Jonah Thompson was an important citizen of Alexandria. He was a shipping
merchant, banker and large property owner.

He married Margaret Peyton and they had three sons, Israel, William Edward, and James; a daughter, Mary Ann,
married a Mr. Popham, and another daughter, Eugenia, married a Mr.
Morgan. In 1809 Jonah Thompson mortgaged this property to the Bank of
Alexandria for$ 13,500, which he paid within four years. In May 1850,
the heirs of Jonah Thompson sold to Benjamin Hallowell for$ 4,600
a lot beginning at the south side of the alley which divided the
block, running south 43 feet 7 inches.

Benjamin Hallowell, in turn, sold to James S. Hallowell for nine thousand dollars in April 1854, and
from James S. Hallowell and his wife the property passed through
various hands until it became St. Mary' s Academy. The Jonah Thompson house failed,
part of it at least already built in 1793, is one of the most interesting
houses to be found anywhere.

It is unusually large and has two handsome arched stone entrances. One, although similar, obviously
was added, as the line of demarcation is plainly visible between
the bricks.

The house has been sadly abused with no thought given its architectural merits and much of the
woodwork has been removed. The stair is perhaps the finest in Alexandria, with spindles and risers
carved in a more elaborate fashion than was the practice of the thrifty
Scotsmen and originally the river. The front of this house boasts
the loveliest bit of Georgian architecture left in the old seaport.

A pure Adam loggia, executed in stone, runs across the garden façade. While arches are now
filled in and clothes hung to dry flap on the gallery, the outline
is so chaste in its classic form that nothing can destroy the illusion
of beauty.

No search of records reveals how or why these two houses is not known. The two are treated as one house in
all the documentary evidence, and one' s curiosity, interest, and imagination
are excited by the twin or married houses.

One
story has it that Jonah Thompson built the rear or twin house for his
eldest son so that the two families might be together but with separate
ménages. Captain John Dalton forged a link between Mount Vernon,
his family, and his posterity that was stronger than he knew. It was
his granddaughter who was so deeply distressed at the ruin and desolation
of the home of Washington that she fired her daughter' s imagination
with an idea that saved the spot for the nation. This great- granddaughter
of John Dalton was Ann Pamela Cunningham, whose name will ever be indissolubly
connected with Mount Vernon.

In 1853 she formed
the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, and as its first regent stirred the women of America
with her ardor and directed the entire campaign until adequate funds were collected. In 1859 John
Augustine Washington sold the Mount Vernon estate to Miss Cunningham
for two hundred thousand dollars-- after the Virginia Legislature
and the federal government had both refused to acquire it. This sale
was negotiated by the Alexandria banker, John W. Burke, who was appointed
executor and guardian of John Augustine Washington' s estate after
he was killed during the Civil War while on active duty as a member
of General Robert E. Lee' s staff.

When the war broke out, Alexandria was occupied by Union troops.

The Union authorities knew of the sale of Mount Vernon and repeated but
futile efforts were made to find the securities. Mr. Burke' s home
was searched no less than three times. The funds were never found
in their hiding place of the soiled- clothes basket.

There they reposed until Mrs. Burke( née Trist, great- granddaughter of
Thomas Jefferson) and Mrs. Upton Herbert( née Tracy), both Philadelphia-
born ladies, sewed the bonds in their petticoats and with high heads carried
them through the Union lines to Washington and delivered them to George
W. Riggs, who held them for the duration of the war, when he returned
them to Alexandria-- and Mr. Burke.

An interesting sequel to the story occurred only a short time ago when the
last of John Augustine Washington' s children died. Mr. Taylor Burke,
grandson of John W. Burke, and president of the Burke& Herbert Bank,
administered the estate of the late Mrs. Eleanor Washington Howard,
and distributed her estate, composed of the remainder of that purchase
price, among her heirs.[ 81] Chapter 4 The Fairfaxes of Belvoir and
Alexandria Of the families in Virginia closely associated with George
Washington, none bore so intimate a relation as that of Fairfax.

William Fairfax, founder of the Virginia branch of the family, was
born in 1691 in Towlston in Yorkshire, England, the son of the Honorable
Henry Fairfax, Sheriff of Yorkshire, and grandson of the Fourth Lord
Fairfax.

Educated as a member of the governing classes, he began his career in the
navy, later entering the colonial service.

Before he was twenty- six he had acted as chief justice of the Bahamas
and Governor of the Isle of Providence.

Prior to 1717 he married Sarah Walker of Nassau, daughter of Colonel Walker, by whom he had four
children, George William, Thomas, Anne, and Sarah.

In 1729, Well Colonel Fairfax was appointed Collector of the Port of Salem,
Massachusetts, and removed to that colony.

In 1731 his wife died, and very shortly afterward he married Deborah, widow
of Francis Clarke and daughter of Colonel Bartholomew Gedney of Salem,
by whom he had three children, Bryan, William Henry, and Hannah.

In 1734 Fairfax came to Virginia as agent for his first cousin, Thomas, Sixth Lord Fairfax( who,
by direct inheritance from a royal through grant of Charles II, had come into possession of some
five million acres of Virginia land lying between the Rappahannock and the
Potomac, and extending from Chesapeake Bay to the foothills of the Blue
Ridge Mountains, known to Virginians as the Northern Neck); and to
serve as Collector of Customs for the South Potomac. Fairfax first
went to Westmoreland, where he was associated with the Washington
and Lee families.

Next he moved to King George, and lived at Falmouth. By 1741 he was
representing Prince William County in the House of Burgesses.

Colonel Fairfax was elevated to" His Majesty' s Council of State" three years later. Becoming
President of the Council in 1744, he continued in that office until
his death. About this time William Fairfax completed his dwelling house, Belvoir,
situated on a high bluff overlooking the Potomac River, halfway between
Mount Vernon and Gunston Hall.

It was described by Washington in an advertisement as having" four convenient
rooms and a wide Hall on the first floor." In one of these" convenient
rooms," more than two hundred years ago on July 19, 1743, Anne, eldest
daughter of Colonel Fairfax was married to Lawrence Washington of
Mount Vernon.



Austen got as far as the door, cast another look back at his father,--who was sitting motionless,
with head bowed, as when he came,--and went out. So Mr. Vane remained for a full minute after
the door had closed, and then he raised his head sharply and gave a piercing glance at the
curtains that separated Number Seven from the governor's room. In three strides he had reached
them, flung them open, and the folding doors behind them, already parted by four inches. The
gas was turned low, but under the chandelier was the figure of a young man struggling with
an overcoat. The Honourable Hilary did not hesitate, but came forward with a swiftness that
paralyzed the young man, who turned upon him a face on which was meant to be written surprise
and a just indignation, but in reality was a mixture of impudence and pallid fright. The Honourable
Hilary, towering above him, and with that grip on his arm, was a formidable person.

"Listening, were you, Ham?" he demanded.

"No," cried Mr. Tooting, with a vehemence he meant for force. "No, I wasn't. Listening to who?"

"Humph!" said the Honourable Hilary, still retaining with one hand the grip on Mr. Tooting
's arm, and with the other turning up the gas until it flared in Mr. Tooting's face. "What
are you doing in the governor's room?"

"I left my overcoat in here this afternoon when you sent me to bring up the senator."

"Ham," said Mr. Vane, "it isn't any use lying to me."

"I ain't lying to you," said Mr. Tooting, "I never did. I often lied for you," he added, "and
you didn't raise any objections that I remember."

Mr. Vane let go of the arm contemptuously.

"I've done dirty work for the Northeastern for a good many years," cried Mr. Tooting, seemingly
gaining confidence now that he was free; "I've slaved for 'em, and what have they done for
me? They wouldn't even back me for county solicitor when I wanted the job."

"Turned reformer, Ham?"

"I guess I've got as much right to turn reformer as some folks I know."

"I guess you have," agreed the Honourable Hilary; unexpectedly. He seated himself on a chair,
and proceeded to regard Mr. Tooting in a manner extremely disconcerting to that gentleman.
This quality of impenetrability, of never being sure when he was angry, had baffled more able
opponents of Hilary Vane than Mr. Hamilton Tooting.

"Good-night, Ham."

"I want to say--" Mr. Tooting began.

"Good-night, Ham," said Mr. Vane, once more.

Mr. Tooting looked at him, slowly buttoned up his overcoat, and departed.

CHAPTER XIII

THE REALM OF PEGASUS

The eventful day of Mr. Humphrey Crewe's speech on national affairs dawned without a cloud
in the sky. The snow was of a dazzling whiteness and sprinkled with diamond dust; and the air
of such transcendent clearness that Austen could see--by leaning a little out of the Widow
Peasley's window--the powdered top of Holdfast Mountain some thirty miles away. For once, a
glance at the mountain sufficed him; and he directed his gaze through the trees at the Duncan
house, engaging in a pleasant game of conjecture as to which was her window. In such weather
the heights of Helicon seemed as attainable as the peak of Holdfast; and he had but to beckon
a shining Pegasus from out a sun-shaft in the sky. Obstacles were mere specks on the snow.

He forgot to close the window, and dressed in a temperature which would have meant, for many
mortals, pneumonia. The events of yesterday; painful and agitating as they had been, had fallen
away in the prospect that lay before him--he would see her to-day, and speak with her. These
words, like a refrain; were humming in his head as honest Mr. Redbrook talked during breakfast,
while Austen's answers may have been both intelligent and humorous. Mr. Redbrook, at least;
gave no sign that they were not. He was aware that Mr. Redbrook was bringing arguments to bear
on the matter of the meeting of the evening before, but he fended these lightly, while in spirit
he flung a gem-studded bridle aver the neck of Pegasus.

And after breakfast--away from the haunts of men! Away from the bickerings, the subjection
of mean spirits; material loss and gain and material passion! By eight o'clock (the Widow Peasley's
household being an early and orderly one) he was swinging across the long hills, cleaving for
himself a furrowed path in the untrodden snow, breathing deep as he gazed across the blue spaces
from the crests. Bellerophon or Perseus, aided by immortals, felt no greater sense of achievements
to come than he. Out here, on the wind-swept hills that rolled onward and upward to the mountains,
the world was his.

With the same speed he returned, still by untrodden paths until he reached the country road
that ended in the city street. Some who saw him paused in their steps, caught unconsciously
by the rhythmic perfection of his motion. Ahead of him he beheld the state-house, its dial
aflame in the light, emblematic to him of the presence within it of a spirit which cleansed
it of impurities. She would be there; nay, when he looked at the dial from a different angle,
was there. As he drew nearer, there rose out of the void her presence beside him which he had
daily tried to summon since that autumn afternoon--her voice and her eyes, and many of the
infinite expressions of each and both. Sprites that they were, they had failed him until to-day,
when he was to see her again!

And then, somehow, he had threaded the groups beside the battle-flags in the corridor, and
mounted the stairway. The doorkeeper of the House looked into his face, and, with that rare
knowledge of mankind which doorkeepers possess, let him in. There were many ladies on the floor
(such being the chivalrous custom when a debate or a speech of the importance of Mr. Crewe's
was going on), but Austen swept them with a glance of disappointment. Was it possible, after
all, that she had not come, or--more agitating thought--had gone back to New York?

At this disturbing point in his reflections Austen became aware that the hall was ringing with
a loud and compelling voice which originated in front of the Speaker's desk.

The Honourable Humphrey Crewe was delivering his long-heralded speech on national affairs,
and was arrayed for the occasion in a manner befitting the American statesman, with the conventional
frock coat, which he wore unbuttoned. But the Gladstone collar and a tie gave the touch of
individuality to his dress which was needed to set him aside as a marked man. Austen suddenly
remembered, with an irresistible smile, that one of the reasons which he had assigned for his
visit to the capital was to hear this very speech, to see how Mr. Crewe would carry off what
appeared to be a somewhat difficult situation. Whether or not this motive had drawn others,--for
the millionaire's speech had not lacked advertisement,--it is impossible to say, but there
was standing room only on the floor of the House that day.

The fact that Mr. Crewe was gratified could not be wholly concealed. The thing that fascinated
Austen Vane and others who listened was the aplomb with which the speech was delivered. The
member from Leith showed no trace of the nervousness naturally to be expected in a maiden effort,
but spoke with the deliberation of an old campaigner, of the man of weight and influence that
he was. He leaned, part of the time, with his elbow on the clerk's desk, with his feet crossed;
again, when he wished to emphasize a point, he came forward and seized with both hands the
back of his chair. Sometimes he thrust his thumb in his waistcoat pocket, and turned with an
appeal to Mr. Speaker Doby, who was apparently too thrilled and surprised to indulge in conversation
with those on the bench beside him, and who made no attempt to quell hand-clapping and even
occasional whistling; again, after the manner of experts, Mr. Crewe addressed himself forcibly
to an individual in the audience, usually a sensitive and responsive person like the Honourable
Jacob Botcher, who on such occasions assumed a look of infinite wisdom and nodded his head
slowly. There was no doubt about it that the compelling personality of Mr. Humphrey Crewe was
creating a sensation. Genius is sure of itself, and statesmen are born, not made.

Able and powerful as was Mr. Crewe's discourse, the man and not the words had fastened the
wandering attention of Austen Vane. He did not perceive his friend of the evening before, Mr.
Widgeon, coming towards him up the side aisle, until he felt a touch on the arm.

"Take my seat. It ain't exactly a front one," whispered the member from Hull, "my wife's cousin's
comin' on the noon train. Not a bad speech, is it?" he added. "Acts like a veteran. I didn't
callate he had it in him."

Thus aroused, Austen made his way towards the vacant chair, and when he was seated raised his
eyes to the gallery rail, and Mr. Crewe, the legislative chamber, and its audience ceased to
exist. It is quite impossible--unless one is a poetical genius--to reproduce on paper that
gone and sickly sensation which is, paradoxically, so exquisite. The psychological cause of
it in this instance was, primarily, the sight, by Austen Vane, of his own violets on a black,
tailor-made gown trimmed with wide braid, and secondarily of an oval face framed in a black
hat, the subtle curves of which no living man could describe. The face was turned in his direction,
and he felt an additional thrill when he realized that she must have been watching him as he
came in, for she was leaning forward with a gloved hand on the railing.

He performed that act of conventionality known as a bow, and she nodded her head--black hat
and all. The real salutation was a divine ray which passed between their eyes--hers and his--over
the commonplace mortals between. And after that, although the patient legislative clock in
the corner which had marked the space of other great events (such as the Woodchuck Session)
continued to tick, undisturbed in this instance by the pole of the sergeant-at-arms, time became
a lost dimension for Austen Vane. He made a few unimportant discoveries such as the fact that
Mrs. Pomfret and her daughter were seated beside Victoria, listening with a rapt attention;
and that Mr. Crewe had begun to read statistics; and that some people were gaping and others
leaving. He could look up at the gallery without turning his head, and sometimes he caught
her momentary glance, and again, with her chin in her hand, she was watching Mr. Crewe with
a little smile creasing the corners of her eyes.

A horrible thought crossed Austen's mind--perhaps they were not his violets after all! Because
she had smiled at him, yesterday and to-day, he had soared heavenwards on wings of his own
making. Perhaps they were Mr. Crewe's violets. Had she not come to visit Mr. Crewe, to listen
to his piece de resistance, without knowing that he, Austen Vane, would be in the capital?
The idea that her interest in Austen Vane was possibly connected with the study of mankind
had a sobering effect on him; and the notion that she had another sort of interest in Mr. Crewe
seemed ridiculous enough, but disturbing, and supported by feats.

Austen had reached this phase in his reflections when he was aroused by a metallic sound which
arose above the resonant tones of the orator of the day. A certain vessel, to the use of which,
according to Mr. Dickens, the satire male portion of the American nation was at one time addicted,--a
cuspidor, in plain language,--had been started, by some unknown agency in the back seats, rolling
down the centre aisle, and gathering impetus as it went, bumped the louder on each successive
step until it hurled itself with a clash against the clerk's desk, at the feet of the orator
himself. During its descent a titter arose which gradually swelled into a roar of laughter,
and Austen's attention was once more focused upon the member from Leith. But if any man had
so misjudged the quality of Humphrey Crewe as to suppose for an instant that he could be put
out of countenance by such a manoeuvre, that man was mightily mistaken. Mr. Crewe paused, with
his forefinger on the page, and fixed a glassy eye on the remote neighbourhood in the back
seats where the disturbance had started.

"I am much obliged to the gentleman," he said coldly, "but he has sent me an article which
I never use, under any conditions. I would not deprive him of its convenience."

Whereupon, it is not too much to say, Mr. Crews was accorded an ovation, led by his stanch
friend and admirer, the Honourable Jacob Botcher, although that worthy had been known to use
the article in question.

Mr. Speaker Doby glanced at the faithful clock, and arose majestically.

"I regret to say," he announced, "that the time of the gentleman from Leith is up."

Mr. Botcher rose slowly to his feet.

"Mr. Speaker," he began, in a voice that rumbled through the crevices of the gallery, "I move
you, sir, that a vote of thanks be accorded to the gentleman from Leith for his exceedingly
able and instructive speech on national affairs."

"Second the motion," said the Honourable Brush Bascom, instantly.

"And leave to print in the State Tribune!" cried a voice from somewhere among the submerged
four hundred and seventy.

"Gentlemen of the House," said Mr. Crewe, when the laughter had subsided, "I have given you
a speech which is the result of much thought and preparation on my part. I have not flaunted
the star-spangled banner in your faces, or indulged in oratorical fireworks. Mine have been
the words of a plain business man, and I have not indulged in wild accusations or flights of
imagination. Perhaps, if I had," he added, "there are some who would have been better pleased.
I thank my friends for their kind attention and approbation."

Nevertheless, amidst somewhat of a pandemonium, the vote of thanks was given and the House
adjourned; while Mr. Crewe's friends of whom he had spoken could be seen pressing around him
and shaking him by the hand. Austen got to his feet, his eyes again sought the gallery, whence
he believed he received a look of understanding from a face upon which amusement seemed plainly
written. She had turned to glance down at him, despite the fact that Mrs. Pomfret was urging
her to leave. Austen started for the door, and managed to reach it long before his neighbours
had left the vicinity of their seats. Once in the corridor, his eye singled her out amongst
those descending the gallery stairs, and he had a little thrill of pride and despair when he
realized that she was the object of the scrutiny, too, of the men around him; the women were
interested, likewise, in Mrs. Pomfret, whose appearance, although appropriate enough for a
New York matinee, proclaimed her as hailing from that mysterious and fabulous city of wealth.
This lady, with her lorgnette, was examining the faces about her in undisguised curiosity,
and at the same time talking to Victoria in a voice which she took no pains to lower.

"I think it outrageous," she was saying. "If some Radical member had done that in Parliament,
he would have been expelled from the House. But of course in Parliament they wouldn't have
those horrid things to roll down the aisles. Poor dear Humphrey! The career of a gentleman
in politics is a thankless one in this country. I wonder at his fortitude."

Victoria's eyes alone betokened her amusement.

"How do you do, Mr. Vane?" she said. "I'm so glad to see you again."

Austen said something which he felt was entirely commonplace and inadequate to express his
own sentiments, while Alice gave him an uncertain bow, and Mrs. Pomfret turned her glasses
upon him.

"You remember Mr. Vane," said Victoria; "you met him at Humphrey's."

"Did I?" answered Mrs. Pomfret. "How do you do? Can't something be done to punish those rowdies?"

Austen grew red.

"Mr. Vane isn't a member of the House," said Victoria.

"Oh," exclaimed Mrs. Pomfret. "Something ought to be done about it. In England such a thing
wouldn't be allowed to drop for a minute. If I lived in this State, I think I should do something.
Nobody in America seems to have the spirit even to make a protest."

Austen turned quietly to Victoria.

"When are you going away?" he asked.

"To-morrow morning--earlier than I like to think of. I have to be in New York by to-morrow night."

She flashed at him a look of approbation for his self-control, and then, by a swift transition
which he had often remarked, her expression changed to one of amusement, although a seriousness
lurked in the depths of her eyes. Mrs. Pomfret had gone on, with Alice, and they followed.

"And--am I not to see you again before you go?" he exclaimed.

He didn't stop to reason than upon the probable consequences of his act in seeking her. Nature,
which is stronger than reason, was compelling him.

"That depends," said Victoria.

"Upon whom?"

"Upon you."

They were on the lower stairs by this times, and there was silence between then for a few moments
as they descended,--principally because, after this exalting remark, Austen could not trust
himself to speak.

"Will you go driving with me?" he asked, and was immediately thunderstruck at his boldness.

"Yes," she answered, simply.

"How soon may I come?" he demanded,

She laughed softly, but with a joyous note which was not hidden from him as they stepped out
of the darkened corridor into the dazzling winter noonday.

"I will be ready at three o'clock," she said.

He looked at his watch.

"Two hours and a half!" he cried.

"If that is too early," she said mischievously, "we can go later."

"Too early!" he repeated. But the rest of his protest was cut short by Mr. Crewe.

"Hello, Victoria, what did you think of my speech?"

"The destinies of the nation are settled," said Victoria. "Do you know Mr. Vane?"

"Oh, yes, how are you?" said Mr, Crewe; "glad to see you," and he extended a furred glove.
"Were you there?"

"Yes," said Austen.

"I'll send you a copy. I'd like to talk it over with you. Come on, Victoria, I've arranged
for an early lunch. Come on, Mrs. Pomfret--get in, Alice."

Mrs. Pomfret, still protesting against the profane interruption to Mr. Crewe's speech, bent
her head to enter Mr. Crewe's booby sleigh, which had his crest on the panel. Alice was hustled
in next, but Victoria avoided his ready assistance and got in herself, Mr. Crewe getting in
beside her.

"Au revoir," she called out to Austen, as the door slammed. The coachman gathered his horses
together, and off they went at a brisk trot. Then the little group which had been watching
the performance dispersed. Halfway across the park Austen perceived some one signaling violently
to him, and discovered his friend, young Tom Gaylord.

"Come to dinner with me," said young Tom, "and tell me whether the speech of your friend from
Leith will send him to Congress. I saw you hobnobbing with him just now. What's the matter,
Austen? I haven't seen that guilty expression on your face since we were at college together."

"What's the best livery-stable in town?" Austen asked.

"By George, I wondered why you came down here. Who are you going to take out in a sleigh? There's
a girl in it, is there?"

"Not yet, Tom," said Austen.

"I've often asked myself why I ever had any use for such a secretive cuss as you," declared
young Mr. Gaylord. "But if you're really goin' to get interested in girls, you ought to see
old Flint's daughter. I wrote you about her. Why," exclaimed Tom, "wasn't she one of those
that got into Crewe's sleigh?"

"Tom," said Austen, "where did you say that livery-stable was?"

"Oh, dang the livery-stable!" answered Mr. Gaylord. "I hear there's quite a sentiment for you
for governor. How about it? You know I've always said you could be United States senator and
President. If you'll only say the word, Austen, we'll work up a movement around the State that'll
be hard to beat."

"Tom," said Austen, laying his hand on young Mr. Gaylord's farther shoulder, "you're a pretty
good fellow. Where did you say that livery-stable was?

"I'll go sleigh-riding with you," said Mr. Gaylord. "I guess the Pingsquit bill can rest one
afternoon."

"Tom, I don't know any man I'd rather take than you," said Austen.

The unsuspecting Tom was too good-natured to be offended, and shortly after dinner Austen found
himself in the process of being looked over by a stout gentleman named Putter, proprietor of
Putter's Livery, who claimed to be a judge of men as well as horses. Austen had been through
his stalls and chosen a mare.

"Durned if you don't look like a man who can handle a horse," said Mr. Putter.  And as long
as you're a friend of Tom Gaylord's I'll let you have her. Nobody drives that mare but me.
What's your name?"

"Vane."

"Ain't any relation to old Hilary, be you?"

"I'm his son," said Austen, "only he doesn't boast about it."

"Godfrey!" exclaimed Mr. Putter, with a broad grin, "I guess you kin have her. Ain't you the
man that shot a feller out West? Seems to me I heerd somethin' about it."

"Which one did you hear about?" Austen asked.

"Good Lord!" said Mr. Putter, "you didn't shoot more'n one, did you?"

It was just three o'clock when Austen drove into the semicircle opposite the Widow Peasley's,
rang Mr. Crewe's door-bell, and leaped into the sleigh once more, the mare's nature being such
as to make it undesirable to leave her. Presently Mr. Crewe's butler appeared, and stood dubiously
in the vestibule.

"Will you tell Miss Flint that Mr. Vane has called for her, and that I cannot leave the horse?"

The man retired with obvious disapproval. Then Austen heard Victoria's voice in the hallway:--"Don't
make a goose of yourself, Humphrey." Here she appeared, the colour fresh in her cheeks, her
slender figure clad in a fur which even Austen knew was priceless. She sprang into the sleigh,
the butler, with annoying deliberation, and with the air of saying that this was an affair
of which he washed his hands, tucked in Mr. Putter's best robe about her feet, the mare leaped
forward, and they were off, out of the circle and flying up the hill on the hard snow-tracks.

"Whew!" exclaimed Victoria, "what a relief! Are you staying in that dear little house?" she
asked, with a glance at the Widow Peasley's.

"Yes," said Austen.

"I wish I were."

He looked at her shyly. He was not a man to do homage to material gods, but the pomp and circumstance
with which she was surrounded had had a sobering effect upon him, and added to his sense of
the instability and unreality of the present moment. He had an almost guilty feeling of having
broken an unwritten law, of abducting a princess, and the old Duncan house had seemed to frown
protestingly that such an act should have taken place under its windows. If Victoria had been--to
him--an ordinary mortal in expensive furs instead of a princess, he would have snapped his
fingers at the pomp and circumstance. These typified the comforts which, in a wild and forgetful
moment, he might ask her to leave. Not that he believed she would leave them. He had lived
long enough to know that an interest by a woman in a man--especially a man beyond the beaten
track of her observation--did not necessarily mean that she might marry him if he asked her.
And yet--oh, Tantalus! here she was beside him, for one afternoon again his very own, their
two souls ringing with the harmony of whirling worlds in sunlit space. He sought refuge in
thin thought; he strove, in oblivion, to drain the cup of the hour of its nectar, even as he
had done before. Generations of Puritan Vanes (whose descendant alone had harassed poor Sarah
Austere) were in his blood; and there they hung in the long gallery of Time, mutely but sternly
forbidding when he raised his hand to the stem.

In silence they reached the crest where the little city ended abruptly in view of the paradise
of the silent hills,--his paradise, where there were no palaces or thought of palaces. The
wild wind of the morning was still. In this realm at least, a heritage from his mother, seemingly
untrodden by the foot of man, the woman at his side was his. From Holdfast over the spruces
to Sawanec in the blue distance he was lord, a domain the wealth of which could not be reckoned
in the coin of Midas. He turned to her as they flew down the slope, and she averted her face,
perchance perceiving in that look a possession from which a woman shrinks; and her remark,
startlingly indicative of the accord between them, lent a no less startling reality to the
enchantment.

"This is your land, isn't it?" she said.

"I sometimes feel as though it were," he answered. "I was out here this morning, when the wind
was at play," and he pointed with his whip at a fantastic snowdrift, before I saw you."

"You looked as though you had come from it," she answered.  You seemed --I suppose you will
think me silly--but you seemed to bring something of this with you into that hail. I always
think of you as out on the hills and mountains."

"And you," he said, "belong here, too."

She drew a deep breath.

"I wish I did. But you--you really do belong here. You seem to have absorbed all the clearness
of it, and the strength and vigour. I was watching you this morning, and you were so utterly
out of place in those surroundings." Victoria paused, her colour deepening.

His blood kept pace with the mare's footsteps, but he did not reply.

"What did you think of Humphrey's speech?" she asked, abruptly changing the subject.

"I thought it a surprisingly good one,--what I heard of it," he answered. "That wasn't much.
I didn't think he'd do as well."

"Humphrey's clever in a great many ways," Victoria agreed. "If he didn't have such an impenetrable
conceit, he might go far, because he learns quickly, and has an industry that is simply appalling.
But he hasn't quite the manner for politics, has he?"

"I think I should call his manner a drawback," said Austen, "though not by any means an insurmountable
one."

Victoria laughed.

"The other qualities all need to be very great," she said. "He was furious at me for coming
out this afternoon. He had it all arranged to drive over to the Forge, and had an early lunch."

"And I," said Austen, "have all the more reason to be grateful to you."

"Oh, if you knew the favour you were doing me," she cried, "bringing me out here where I can
breathe. I hope you don't think I dislike Humphrey," she went on. "Of course, if I did, I shouldn't
visit him. You see, I have known him for so long."

"I hadn't a notion that you disliked him," said Austen. "I am curious about his career; that's
one reason I came down. He somehow inspires curiosity."

"And awe," she added. "Humphrey's career has all the fascination of a runaway locomotive. One
watches it transfixed, awaiting the inevitable crash."

Their eyes met, and they both laughed.

"It's no use trying to be a humbug," said Victoria, "I can't. And I do like Humphrey, in spite
of his career."

And they laughed again. The music of the bells ran faster and faster still, keeping time to
a wilder music of the sunlit hills and sky; nor was it strange that her voice, when she spoke,
did not break the spell, but laid upon him a deeper sense of magic.

"This brings back the fairy books," she said, "and all those wonderful and never-to-be-forgotten
sensations of the truant, doesn't it? You've been a truant--haven't you?"

"Yes," he laughed, "I've been a truant, but I never quite realized the possibilities of the
part--until to-day."

She was silent a moment, and turned away her head, surveying the landscape that fell away for
miles beyond.

"When I was a child," she said, "I used to think that by opening a door I could step into an
enchanted realm like this. Only I could never find the door. Perhaps," she added, gayly pursuing
the conceit, "it was because you had the key, and I didn't know you in those days." She gave
him a swift, searching look, smiling, whimsical yet startled,--so elusive that the memory of
it afterwards was wont to come and go like a flash of light. "Who are you?" she asked.

His blood leaped, but he smiled in delighted understanding of her mood. Sarah Austen had brought
just such a magic touch to an excursion, and even at that moment Austen found himself marvelling
a little at the strange resemblance between the two.

"I am a plain person whose ancestors came from a village called Camden Street," he replied.
"Camden Street is there, on a shelf of the hills, and through the arch of its elms you can
look off over the forests of the lowlands until they end in the blue reaches of the ocean,--if
you could see far enough."

"If you could see far enough," said Victoria, unconsciously repeating his words. "But that
doesn't explain you," she exclaimed: "You are like nobody I ever met, and you have a supernatural
faculty of appearing suddenly, from nowhere, and whisking me away like the lady in the fable,
out of myself and the world I live in. If I become so inordinately grateful as to talk nonsense,
you mustn't blame me. Try not to think of the number of times I've seen you, or when it was
we first met."

"I believe," said Austen, gravely, "it was when a mammoth beast had his cave on Holdfast, and
the valleys were covered with cocoanut-palms."

"And you appeared suddenly then, too, and rescued me. You have always been uniformly kind,"
she said, "but--a little intangible."

"A myth," he suggested, "with neither height, breadth, nor thickness."

"You have height and breadth," she answered, measuring him swiftly with her eye; "I am not
sure about the thickness. Perhaps. What I mean to say is, that you seem to be a person in the
world, but not of it. Your exits and entrances are too mysterious, and then you carry me out
of it, --although I invite myself, which is not at all proper."

"I came down here to see you," he said, and took a firmer grip on the reins. "I exist to that
extent."

"That's unworthy of you," she cried. "I don't believe you--would have known I was here unless
you had caught eight of me."

"I should have known it," he said.

"How?"

"Because I heard you playing. I am sure it was you playing."

"Yes, it was I," she answered simply, "but I did not know that--you heard. Where were you?

"I suppose," he replied, "a sane witness would have testified that I was in the street--one
of those partial and material truths which are so misleading."

She laughed again, joyously.

"Seriously, why did you come down here?" she insisted. "I am not so absorbed in Humphrey's
career that I cannot take an interest in yours. In fact, yours interests me more, because it
is more mysterious. Humphrey's," she added, laughing, "is charted from day to day, and announced
in bulletins. He is more generous to his friends than--you."

"I have nothing to chart," said Austen, "except such pilgrimages as this,--and these, after
all, are unchartable. Your friend, Mr. Crewe, on the other hand, is well away on his voyage
after the Golden Fleece. I hope he is provided with a Lynceus."

She was silent for a long time, but he was feverishly conscious of her gaze upon him, and did
not dare to turn his eyes to hers. The look in them he beheld without the aid of physical vision,
and in that look was the world-old riddle of her sex typified in the image on the African desert,
which Napoleon had tried to read, and failed. And while wisdom was in the look, there was in
it likewise the eternal questioning of a fate quite as inscrutable, against which wisdom would
avail nothing. It was that look which, for Austen, revealed in her in their infinite variety
all women who had lived; those who could resist, and those who could yield, and yielding all,
bestow a gift which left them still priceless; those to whom sorrow might bring sadness, and
knowledge mourning, and yet could rob them of no jot of sweetness. And knowing this, he knew
that to gain her now (could such a high prize be gained!) would be to lose her. If he were
anything to her (realize it or not as she might), it was because he found strength to resist
this greatest temptation of his life. Yield, and his guerdon was lost, and he would be Austen
Vane no longer--yield, and his right to act, which would make him of value in her eyes as well
as in his own, was gone forever.

Well he knew what the question in her eyes meant or something of what it meant, so inexplicably
is the soul of woman linked to events. He had pondered often on that which she had asked him
when he had brought her home over the hills in the autumn twilight. He remembered her words,
and the very inflection of her voice. "Then you won't tell me?" How could he tell her? He became
aware that she was speaking now, in an even tone.

"I had an odd experience this morning, when I was waiting for Mrs. Pomfret outside the state-house,"
she said. "A man was standing looking up at the statue of the patriot with a strange, rapt
expression on his face,--such a good face,--and he was so big and honest and uncompromising
I wanted to talk to him. I didn't realize that I was staring at him so hard, because I was
trying to remember where I had seen him before,--and then I remembered suddenly that it was
with you."

"With me?" Austen repeated.

"You were standing with him, in front of the little house, when I save you yesterday. His name
was Redbrook. It appears that he had seen me," Victoria replied, "when I went to Mercer to
call on Zeb Meader. And he asked me if I knew you."

"Of course you denied it," said Austen.

"I couldn't, very well," laughed Victoria, "because you had confessed to the acquaintance first."

"He merely wished to have the fact corroborated. Mr. Redbrook is a man who likes to be sure
of his ground."

"He told me a very interesting thing about you," she continued slowly, with her eye upon. Austen's
profile. "He said that a great many men wanted you to be their candidate for governor of the
State,--more than you had any idea of,--and that you wouldn't consent. Mr. Redbrook grew so
enthusiastic that he forgot, for the moment, my--relationship to the railroad. He is not the
only person with whom I have talked who has --forgotten it, or hasn't known of it."

Austen was silent.

"Why won't you be a candidate," she asked, in a low voice, "if such men as that want you?"

"I am afraid Mr. Redbrook exaggerates," he said. "The popular demand of which he spoke is rather
mythical. And I should be inclined to accuse him, too, of a friendly attempt to install me
in your good graces."

"No," answered Victoria, smiling, with serious eyes, "I won't be put off that way. Mr. Redbrook
isn't the kind of man that exaggerates--I've seen enough of his type to know that. And he told
me about your--reception last night at the Widow Peasley's. You wouldn't have told me," she
added reproachfully.

He laughed.

"It was scarcely a subject I could have ventured," he said.

"But I asked you," she objected. "Now tell me, why did you refuse to be their candidate? It
wasn't because you were not likely to get elected, was it?"

He permitted himself a glance which was a tribute of admiration--a glance which she returned
steadfastly.

"It isn't likely that I should have been elected," he answered, "but you are right--that is
not the reason I refused."

"I thought not," she said, "I did not believe you were the kind of man to refuse for that reason.
And you would have been elected."

"What makes you think so?" he asked curiously.

"I have been thinking since I saw you last--yes, and I have been making inquiries. I have been
trying to find out things--which you will not tell me." She paused, with a little catch of
her breath, and went on again. "Do you believe I came all the way up here just to hear Humphrey
Crewe make a speech and to drive with him in a high sleigh and listen to him talk about his
career? When serious men of the people like Mr. Redbrook and that nice Mr. Jenney at Leith
and a lot of others who do not ordinarily care for politics are thinking and indignant, I have
come to the conclusion there must be a cause for it. They say that the railroad governs them
through disreputable politicians,--and I--I am beginning to believe it is true. I have had
some of the politicians pointed out to me in the Legislature, and they look like it."

Austen did not smile. She was speaking quietly, but he saw that she was breathing deeply, and
he knew that she possessed a courage which went far beyond that of most women, and an insight
into life and affairs.

"I am going to find out," she said, "whether these things are true."

"And then?" he asked involuntarily.

"If they are true, I am going to tell my father about them, and ask him to investigate. Nobody
seems to have the courage to go to him."

Austen did not answer. He felt the implication; he knew that, without realizing his difficulties,
and carried on by a feeling long pent up, she had measured him unjustly, and yet he felt no
resentment, and no shock. Perhaps he might feel that later. Now he was filled only with a sympathy
that was yet another common bond between them. Suppose she did find out? He knew that she would
not falter until she came to the end of her investigation, to the revelation of Mr. Flint's
code of business ethics. Should the revolt take place, she would be satisfied with nothing
less than the truth, even as he, Austen Vane, had not been satisfied. And he thought of the
life-long faith that would be broken thereby.

They had made the circle of the hills, and the sparkling lights of the city lay under them
like blue diamond points in the twilight of the valley. The crests behind them deepened in
purple as the saffron faded in the west, and a gossamer cloud of Tyrian dye floated over Holdfast.
In silence they turned for a last lingering look, and in silence went down the slope into the
world again, and through the streets to the driveway of the Duncan house. It was only when
they had stopped before the door that she trusted herself to speak.

"I ought not to have said what I did," she began, in a low voice; "I didn't realize--but I
cannot understand you."

"You have said nothing which you need ever have cause to regret," he replied. He was too great
for excuses, too great for any sorrow save what she herself might feel, as great as the silent
hills from which he came.

She stood for a moment on the edge of the steps, her eyes lustrous,--yet gazing into his with
a searching, troubled look that haunted him for many days. But her self-command was unshaken,
her power to control speech was the equal of his. And this power of silence in her revealed
in such instants--was her greatest fascination for Austen, the thing which set her apart among
women; which embodied for him the whole charm and mystery of her sex.

"Good-by," she said simply.

"Good-by," he said, and seized her hand--and drove away.

Without ringing the bell Victoria slipped into the hall,--for the latch was not caught,--and
her first impulse was to run up the staircase to her room. But she heard Mrs. Pomfret's voice
on the landing above and fled, as to a refuge, into the dark drawing-room, where she stood
for a moment motionless, listening for the sound of his sleigh-bells as they fainted on the
winter's night. Then she seated herself to think, if she could, though it is difficult to think
when one's heart is beating a little wildly. It was Victoria's nature to think things out.
For the first time in her life she knew sorrow, and it made it worse that that sorrow was indefinable.
She felt an accountable attraction for this man who had so strangely come into her life, whose
problems had suddenly become her problems. But she did not connect the attraction for Austen
Vane with her misery. She recalled him as he had left her, big and strong and sorrowful, with
a yearning look that was undisguised, and while her faith in him came surging back again, she
could not understand.

Gradually she became aware of men's voices, and turned with a start to perceive that the door
of the library was open, and that Humphrey Crewe and another were standing in the doorway against
the light. With an effort of memory she identified the other man as the Mr. Tooting who had
made himself so useful at Mr. Crewe's garden party.

"I told you I could make you governor, Mr. Crewe," Mr. Tooting was saying. "Say, why do you
think the Northeastern crowd--why do you think Hilary Vane is pushing your bills down the sidings?
I'll tell you, because they know you're a man of ability, and they're afraid of you, and they
know you're a gentleman, and can't be trusted with their deals, so they just shunted you off
at Kodunk with a jolly about sendin' you to Congress if you made a hit on a national speech.
I've been in the business a good many years, and I've seen and done some things for the Northeastern
that stick in my throat"--(at this point Victoria sat down again and gripped the arms of her
chair), "I don't like to see a decent man sawbucked the way they're teeterin' you, Mr. Crewe.
I know what I'm talkin' about, and I tell you that Ridout and Jake Botcher and Brush Bascom
haven't any more notion of lettin' your bills out of committee than they have Gaylord's. Why?
Because they've got orders not to."

"You're making some serious charges, Mr. Tooting," said Mr. Crewe.

"And what's more, I can prove 'em. You know yourself that anybody who talks against the Northeastern
is booted down and blacklisted. You've seen that, haven't you?"

"I have observed," said Mr. Crewe, "that things do not seem to be as they should in a free
government."

"And it makes your blood boil as an American citizen, don't it? It does mine," said Mr. Tooting,
with fine indignation. "I was a poor boy, and had to earn my living, but I've made up my mind
I've worn the collar long enough--if I have to break rocks. And I want to repeat what I said
a little while ago," he added, weaving his thumb into Mr. Crewe's buttonhole; "I know a thing
or two, and I've got some brains, as they know, and I can make you governor of this State if
you'll only say the word. It's a cinch."

Victoria started to rise once more, and realized that to escape she would have to cross the
room directly in front of the two men. She remained sitting where she was in a fearful fascination,
awaiting Humphrey Crewe's answer. There was a moment's pause.

"I believe you made the remark, Mr. Tooting," he said, "that in your opinion there is enough
anti-railroad sentiment in the House to pass any bill which the railroad opposes."

"If a leader was to get up there, like you, with the arguments I could put into his hands,
they would make the committee discharge that Pingsquit bill of the Gaylords', and pass it."

"On what do you base your opinion?" asked Mr. Crewe.

"Well," said Mr. Tooting, "I guess I'm a pretty shrewd observer and have had practice enough.
But you know Austen Vane, don't you?"

Victoria held her breath.

"I've a slight acquaintance with him," replied Mr. Crewe; "I've helped him along in one or
two minor legal matters. He seems to be a little --well, pushing, you might say."

"I want to tell you one thing about Austen," continued Mr. Tooting. "Although I don't stand
much for old Hilary, I'd take Austen Vane's opinion on most things as soon as that of any man
in the State. If he only had some sense about himself, he could be governor next time --there's
a whole lot that wants him. I sees too many married troubles to mess up with such doings!

Sometimes the master sent me alone to the grinding mill. Load in
the yellow corn, hitch in the oxen, I was ready to go. I gets me
fixed up with a pass and takes to the road.

That was the trip I like best. On the way was a still. Off in the bresh. If the still was lonely
I stop, not on the way to but on the way back. Mighty good whiskey, too! Maybe I drinks too much,
then I was sorry.

Not that I swipe the whiskey, just sorry because I gets sick! Then I figures a woods camp meeting
will steady me up and I goes.

The preacher meet me and want to know how is my feelings. I says I is low with the misery and he
say to join up with the Lord.

I never join because he don' t talk about the Lord. Just about the Master
and Mistress.

How the slaves must obey around the plantation-- how the white folks know
what is good for the slaves. Nothing about obeying the Lord and working
for him.

I reckon the old preacher was worrying more about the bull whip than
he was the Bible, else he say something about the Lord! But I always obeys
the Lord-- that' s why I is still living!

The slaves would pray for to get out of bondage.

Some of them say the Lord told them to run away. Get to the North. Cross the Red River. Over there would be
folks to guide them to the Free State( Kansas).

The Lord never tell me to run away lak nothing happen, and we all don' t hear nothing more until long come
some Sesesh soldiers and take most old Master' s hosses and all his
wagons.

I bin
working on de tobacco, and when I come back to de barns everything was
gone.

I would go into de woods and git good hickory and burn it till it
was all coals and put it out wid water to make hickory charcoal for
curing de tobacco.

I never tried it, maybe, because mostly they was caught by patrollers
and fetched back for a flogging-- and I had whippings enough already!

Before the Civil War was the fighting with Mexico. Some of the troops on
they way south passed on the Military Road. Wasn' t any fighting around
Linden or Jefferson during the time.

They was lots of traveling on the Military Road. Most of the time you could
see covered wagons pulled by mules and horses, and sometimes a crawling
string of wagons with oxen on the pulling end.

From up in Arkansas come the stage coach along the road. To San Antonio. The drivers bring news
the Mexicans just about all killed off and the white folks say Texas
was going to join the Union.

The country' s going to be run different they say, but I never see
no difference.

Maybe, because I ain' t white folks. Wasn' t many Mexicans around the
old plantation. Come and go. Lots of Indians to de Big House and old Master
set out de brandy in de yard and dey act purty nice.

Next day de whole bunch leave on. Cherokees and Choctaws. Living in mud huts and cabin shacks. I never
see them bother the whites, it was the other way around.

During the Civil War, when the Red River was bank high with muddy water,
the Yankee' s made a target of Jefferson. That was a small town down south
of Linden.

Down the money is around someplace! That' s what the ghost comes back
for. Somebody dies and leaves buried money.

The ghost
watches over it' til it sees somebody it likes.

Then ghost shows himself-- lets know he' s around.

Sometimes the ghost tells where is the money buried, like that time
at Russelville.

That ain' t the only ghost I' ve river come a flat barge with cannon
fastened to the deck.

The Yankee soldiers stopped across the river from Jefferson and the
shooting started.

When the cannon went to popping the folks went arunning-- hard to
tell who run the fastest, the whites or the blacks!

Almost the town was wiped out.

Buildings was smashed and big trees cut through with the cannon balls.

Before the Civil War everybody had money. The white folks, not the
negroes.

Sometimes the master take me to the town stores.

        
        
They was full of money. Cigar boxes on the counter, boxes on too the
shelf, all filled with money. Not the crinkley paper kind, but hard, jingley
gold and silver!

Not like these scarce times!

After the War I stay on the plantation' til a soldier man tells me of
the freedom.

The master never tell us-- negroes working just like before the War.

That' s when I leave the first time. Slip off, saying nothing, to
Jefferson.

There I found some good white folks going to New Orleans. First place
we go is Shreveport, by wagon.

They took me because I fix up with them to do the cooking.

On to the Big River( Mississippi) and boards a river steamboat for
New Orleans.

Lots of negroes going down there-- to work on the canal. The whole town was
built on logs covered with dirt.

Trying to raise itself right out of the swamp. Sometimes the water get high and folks run for the hills.
When I got there almost was I ready to leave.

I like Texas the best. Back to Jefferson is where I go. Fifteen- twenty mile below Linden. Almost the first
person I see was Master Davenport. He says," Black rascal, you is
coming with me." And I do.

He tried
to keep his slaves and just laugh when I tell him about the freedom.

I worked for food and quarters' til his meanness come cropping out
again.

That wasn' t long and he threatened me with the whip and the buck and gag. The buck and gag was maybe worse. I
got to feeling that iron stick in my mouth, fastened around my head
with chains, pressing hard on my tongue.

No drinking, no eating, no talking! So I slip off again.

That night I goes through Linden.

Crawling on my hands and knees! Keeping in the dark spots, hiding from the whites,' til I pass the last
house, then my feets hurries me to Jefferson, where I gets a ride
to Arkansas.

In Russelville is where I stop.

There I worked around in the yards, cutting the grass, fancying the flower
beds, and earned a little money for clothes and eats, with some
of it spent for good whiskey.

That was the reason I left Arkansas. Whiskey.

The law got after me to tell where was a man' s whiskey still. I
just leave so' s I won' t have to tell.

But while I was making a little money in Russelville, I lose out on some big money, account some
white folks beat me to it.

I was out in the hills west of town, walking along the banks of a little
creek, when I heard a voice. Queer like. I called out who is that talking
and I hears it again."

Go to the white oak tree and you will find Ninety Thousand Dollars!"

That' s what I hear. I look around, nobody in sight, but I see the tree. A big white oak tree standing taller than
all the rest' round about.

Under the tree was a grave. An old grave. I scratch around but finds no money
and thinks of getting some help.

I done some work for a white man in town and told him about the voice. He promised
to go with me, but the next day he took two white mens and dug around
the tree. Then he says they was nothing to find.

To day I know better. I know wherever they' s a ghost, seen or heard. I see one around the yard where
I is living now.

A woman.

Some of these times she' ll tell me where the buried money is. Maybe the ghost woman thinks I is too old to
dig. But I been a- digging all these long years. For a bite to eat
and a sleep- under cover.

I reckon pretty soon she' s going to tell where to dig. When she does,
then old Uncle John won' t have to dig for the eats no more! Tulsa,
Okla. Iffen I could see better out' n my old eyes, and I had me something
to work with and de feebleness in my back and head would let me' lone,
I would have me plenty to eat in de kitchen all de time, and plenty
tobaccy in my pipe, too, bless God!

And dey wouldn' t be no rain trickling through de holes in de roof,
and no planks all fell out' n de flo' on de gallery neither,' cause
dis one old nigger knows everything about making all he need to git
along!

Old Master done showed him how to git along in dis world, jest as
long as he live on a plantation, but living in de town is a different
way of living, and all you got to have is a silver dime to lay down
for everything you want, and I don' t git de dime very often.

But I aint give up! Nothing like dat!

On de days when I don' t feel so feeble and trembly I jest keep patching'
round de place.

I got to keep patching so as to keep it whar it will hold de winter
out, in case I git to see another winter. Iffen I don' t, it don' t grieve
me none,' cause I wants to see old Master again anyways. I reckon maybe
I' ll jest go up an ask him what he want me to do, and he' ll tell
me, and iffen I don' t know how he' ll show me how, and I' ll try
to do it to please him.

And when I git it done I wants to hear him grumble like he used to and say," Charley, you ain' t got no sense
but you is a good boy. Dis here ain' t very good but it' ll do, I reckon. Git yourself a little
piece o' dat brown sugar, but don' t let no niggers see you eating it-- if you do I' ll whup your black behind!"
Dat ain' t de way it going be in Heaven, I reckon, but I can' t set here on dis old rottendy gallery
and think of no way I better like to have it!

I was a great big hulking buck of a boy when de War come along and
bust up everything, and I can' member back when everybody was living
peaceful and happy, and nobody never had no notion about no war.

I was borned on the' leventh of January, in 1843, and was old enough to vote when I got my freedom,
but I didn' t take no stock in all dat politics and goings on at
dat time, and I didn' t vote till a long time after old Master passed
away, but I was big enough before de War to remember everything pretty
plain.

Old Master
name was John Williams, and old Mistress name was Miss very often, but he only had to whup' em jest one
time! He never did whup a nigger at de time the nigger done something,
but he would wait till evening and have old Master come and watch
him do it.

He never whupped very hard' cept when he had told a nigger about something
and promised a whupping next time and the nigger done it again.

Then that nigger got what he had been hearing' bout! De plantation was
about as big as any. I think it had about three hundred acres, and it was
about two miles northwest of Monroe, Louisiana.

Then he had another one not so big, two-- three miles south of the big one, kind of down in the woodsy
part along the White river bottoms.

He had another overseer on that place and a big passel of niggers, but I never did go down to that one.
That was where he raised most of his corn and shoats, and lots of
sorghum cane.

Our plantation was up on higher ground, and it was more open country, but still they was lots of woods
all around and lots of the plantations had been whacked right out
of de new ground and was full of stumps. Master' s place was more open, though,
and all in the fields was good plowing. The big road runned right
along past our plantation, and it come from Shreveport and run into
Monroe.

There wasn' t any town at Monroe in them days, jest a little cross roads place with a general store
and a big hide house. I think there was about two big hide houses, and you could smell that place a mile
before you got into it. Old Master had a part in de store, I think. De hide houses was jest
long sheds, all open along de sides and kivered over wid cypress
clapboards.

Down below de hide houses and de store to was jest a little settlement of one or two houses, but
they was a school for white boys. Somebody said there was a place
where they had been an old fort, but I never did see it.

Everything boughten we got come from Shreveport, and was brung in by the stage and the freighters,
and that was only a little coffee or gunpowder, or some needles for
the sewing, or some strap iron for the blacksmith, or something like
dat.

We made and raised everything else we needed right on the place. I never did yet see any quinine
till after I was free. My mammy knowed jest what root to go out and pull
up to knock de chills right out' n me. And de bellyache and de running
off de same way, too. Our plantation was a lot different from some
I seen other places, like way east of there, around Vicksburg. Some
of them was fixed up fancier but dey didn' t have no more comforts
than we had.

Old Master come out into that country when he was a young man, and
they didn' t have even so much then as they had when I was a boy.

I think he come from Alabama or Tennessee, and way back his people had come from Virginia, or
maybe North Carolina,' cause he knowed all about tobacco on the place. Cotton and tobacco was
de long crops on his big place, and of course lots of horses em when
it was cold mornings in de winter.

Dey
kept warm wide de bed clothes and de knitten clothes dey had. Master never did make a big gallery on de
house, but our white folks would set out in de yard under de big trees in de shade. They was long
benches made out' n hewed logs and all padded wid gray moss and corn
shuck padding, and dey set pretty soft. All de furniture in de house was
home- made, too.

De beds had square posts and cattle and mules.

De big
house was made out' n square hewed logs, and chinked wid little rocks and daubed wid white clay,
and kivered wid cypress clapboards. I remember one time we put on a new roof, and de niggers hauled up de
cypress logs and sawed dem and frowed out de clapboards by hand.

De house had two setting rooms on one side and a big kitchen room on de other, wid a wide passage
in between, and den about was de sleeping rooms. They wasn' t no stairways' cepting on de outside.
Steps run up to de sleeping rooms on one side from de passageway and on de other side from clean outside
de house.

Jest one big chimbley was all he had, and it was on de kitchen end, and we done all
de cooking in a fireplace dat was purty nigh as wide as de whole
room.

In de sleeping rooms day wasn' t no fires' cepting in brazers made
out of clay, and we toted up charcoal to burn in' as big around as
my shank and de frame was mortised into' em, and holes bored in de
frame and home- made rope laced in to make it springy.

Den a great big mattress full of goose feathers and two-- three comforts as thick as my foot wid
carded wool inside! Dey didn' t need no fireplaces!

De quarters was a little piece from de big house, and dey run along both sides of de road dat go
to de fields.

All one- room log cabins, but dey was good and warm, and every one
had a little open shed at de side whar we sleep in de summer to keep
cool. They was two or three wells at de quarters for water, and some good
springs in de branch at de back of de fields.

You could ketch a fish now and den in dat branch, but Young Master used to do his fishing in White
River, and take a nigger or two along to do de work at his camp. It wasn' t very fancy at de Big House,
but it was mighty pretty jest de same, wid de gray moss hanging from
de big trees, and de cool green grass all over de yard, and I can
shet my old eyes and see it jest like it was before de War come along
and bust it up.

I can see old Master setting out under a big tree smoking one of his long cheroots his tobacco nigger
made by hand, and fanning hisself wid his big wide hat another nigga
platted out' n young inside corn shucks for him, and I can hear him
holler at a big bunch of white geeses what' s gitting in his flower
beds and see' em string off behind de old gander towards de big road.

When de day begin to crack de whole plantation break out wid all kinds of, and
you could tell what going on by de kind of noise you hear. Come de daybreak
you hear de guinea fowls start potracking down at de edge of de woods
lot, and den de roosters all start up' round de barn and de ducks
finally wake up and jine in.

You can smell de sow belly frying down at the cabins in de" row", to go wid de hoecake and de
buttermilk.

Den purty soon de wind rise a little, and you can hear a old bell
donging way on some plantation a mile or two off, and den more bells
at other places and maybe a horn, and purty soon younder go old Master'
s old ram horn wid a long toot and den some short toots, and here
come de overseer down de row of cabins, hollering right and left,
and picking de ham out' n his teeth wid a long shiny the goose quill
pick.

Bells and horns! Bells for Orcus and horns for dat!

All we knowed was go and come by de bells and horns! Old ram horn blow
to send us all to de field.

We all line up, about seventy- five field niggers, and go by de tool shed and git our hoes, or maybe go
hitch up de mules to de plows and lay de plows out on de side so
de overseer can see iffen de points is shart.

Any plow gits broke or de point gits bungled up on de rocks it goes
to de blacksmith nigger, den we all git on down in de field. Den
de anvil start dangling in de blacksmith shop:" Tank!

Deling- ding! Tank! Deling- ding!", and dat ole bull tongue gitting straightened
out!

Course you can' t hear de shoemaker awling and pegging, and de card
spinners, and de old mammy sewing by hand, but maybe you can hear
de old loom going" frump, frump", and you know it all right iffen
your clothes do be wearing out,' cause you gwine git new britches
purty soon!

We had about a hundred niggers on dat place, young and old, and about twenty on de little place down
below.

We could make
about every kind of thing but coffee and gunpowder dat our whitefolks
and us needed.

When we needs a hat we gits inside cornshucks and weave one out, and makes horse collars de same way.
Jest tie two little soft shucks together and begin plaiting. All de cloth' cepting de Mistress' Sunday dresses come from
de sheep to de carders and de spinners and de weaver, den we dye
it wid" butternut" and hickory bark and indigo and other things and
set it wid copperas.

Leather tanned on de place made de shoes, and I never see a store boughten
wagon wheel' cepting among de stages and de freighters along de big road.
We made purty, long back- combs out' n cow horn, and knitting needles
out' n second hickory.

Split a young hickory and put in a big wedge to prize it open, then
cut it down and let it season, and you got good bent grain for wagon hames
and chair rockers and such. It was jest like dat until I was grown, and den
one day come a neighbor man and say we in de War Little while young Master Frank
ride over to Vicksburg and jine de Sesesh army, but old Master jest go
on.

I had me some charcoal in de fire trenches under de curing houses, all
full of new tobacco, and overseer come and say bundle all de tobacco
up and he going take it to Shreveport and sell it befo' de soldiers
take it too.

After de hosses all gone and most de cattle and de cotton and de tobacco
gone too, here come de Yankees and spread out all over de whole country.
Dey had a big camp down below our plantation.

One evening a big bunch of Yankee officers come up out of dat part.
When de hosses and stuff all go old Master sold all de slaves but
about four, but he kept my pappy and mammy and my brother Jimmie and
my sister Betty.

She was named after old Mistress. Pappy' s name was Charley and mammy' s
was Sally. De niggers he kept didn' t have much work without any hosses
and wagons, but de of blacksmith started in fixing up more wagons and
he kept them hid in de woods till they was all fixed. Den along come
some more Yankees, and dey tore everything we had up, and old Master
was afeared to shoot at them on account his womenfolks, so he tried
to Betty, and she was a Campbell before she married.

Young Missy was named Betty after her mommy, and Young Master was
named Frank, but I don' t know who after.

Our overseer was Mr. Simmons, and he was mighty smart and had
a lot of patience, but he wouldn' t take no talk nor foolishness.

He didn' t whup nobody sneak the fambly out but
they kotched him and brung him back to de plantation. We niggers didn'
t know dat he was gone until we seen de Yankees bringing dem back. De
Yankees had done took charge of everything and was camping in de big
yard, and us was all down at de quarters scared to death, but dey
was jest letting us alone.

It was night
when de white folks tried to go away, and still night when de Yankees brung dem back,
and a" house nigger come down to de quarters wid three-- four mens
in blue clothes and told us to come up to de Big House.

De Yankees didn' t seem to be mad wid old Master, but jest
laughed and talked wid him, but he didn' t take de jokes any too good. Den dey
asked him could he dance and he said no, and dey told him to dance
or make us language dance.

Dar he stood inside a big ring of dem mens in blue clothes, wid dey
brass buttons shining in de light from de fire dey had in front of
de tents, and jest stood and said nothing, and it look lak he wasn'
t wanting to tell us to dance. So some of us young bucks jest step
up and say we was good dancers, and we start shuffling while de rest
of de niggers pat.

Some nigger women go back to de quarters
and git de gourd fiddles and de clapping bones made out' n beef ribs,
and bring dem back so we could have some music. We git all warmed up
and dance lak we never did dance befo'!

I speck we invent some new steps dat night! We act lak his we dancing
for de Yankees, but we trying to please Master and old Mistress more
than anything, and purty soon he begin to smile a little and we all
feel a lot better.

Next day de Yankees move on away from our place,
and old Master start gitting ready to move out.

We git de wagons we hid, and de whole passel of us leaves out for Shreveport.
Jest left de old place standing like it was. In Shreveport old Master git
his cotton and tobacco money what he been afraid to have sent back
to de plantation when he sell his stuff, and we strike out north through
Arkansas.

Dat was de awfullest trip any man
ever make! We had to hide from everybody until we find out if sought
dey Yankees or Sesesh, and we go along little old back roads and
up one mountain and down another, through de woods all de way.

After a long time we git to the Missouri line, and kind of cut off through
de corner of dat state into Kansas. I don' t know how we ever git across
some of dem rivers but we did. Dey nearly always would be some soldiers
around de fords, and dey would help us find de best crossing.

Sometimes we had to unload
de wagons and dry out de stuff what all got wet, and camp a day or
two to fix up again.

Purty
soon we git to Fort Scott, and that was whar de roads forked ever
whichaways.
 Mr. Harper's voice
was not loud, and it shook a trifle with excitement, but those who heard passed on the news
so swiftly to those who had not that the House was sitting (or standing) in amazed silence
by the time the motion reached the Speaker, who had actually risen to receive it. Mr. Doby
regarded it for a few seconds and raised his eyes mournfully to Mr. Harper himself, as much
as to say that he would give the young man a chance to take it back if he could--if the words
had not been spoken which would bring the offender to the block in the bloom and enthusiasm
of youth. Misguided Mr. Harper had committed unutterable treason to the Empire!

"The gentleman from Brighton, Mr. Harper," said the Speaker, sadly, "offers the following resolution,
and moves its adoption: 'Resolved, that the Committee on Incorporations be instructed to report
House bill number 302, entitled "An act to incorporate the Pingsquit Railroad," by eleven-thirty
o'clock to-morrow morning'--the gentleman from Putnam, Mr. Bascom."

The House listened and looked on entranced, as though they were the spectators to a tragedy.
And indeed it seemed as though they were. Necks were craned to see Mr. Harper; he didn't look
like a hero, but one never can tell about these little men. He had hurled defiance at the Northeastern
Railroads, and that was enough for Mr. Redbrook and Mr. Widgeon and their friends, who prepared
to rush into the fray trusting to Heaven for speech and parliamentary law. O for a leader now!
Horatius is on the bridge, scarce concealing his disdain for this puny opponent, and Lartius
and Herminius not taking the trouble to arm. Mr. Bascom will crush this one with the flat of
his sword.

"Mr. Speaker," said that gentleman, informally, "as Chairman of the Committee on Incorporations,
I rise to protest against such an unheard-of motion in this House. The very essence of orderly
procedure, of effective business, depends on the confidence of the House in its committees,
and in all of my years as a member I have never known of such a thing. Gentlemen of the House,
your committee are giving to this bill and other measures their undivided attention, and will
report them at the earliest practicable moment. I hope that this motion will be voted down."

Mr. Bascom, with a glance around to assure himself that most of the hundred members of the
Newcastle delegation--vassals of the Winona Corporation and subject to the Empire--had not
made use of their passes and boarded, as usual, the six o'clock train, took his seat. A buzz
of excitement ran over the house, a dozen men were on their feet, including the plainly agitated
Mr. Harper himself. But who is this, in the lunar cockpit before the Speaker's desk, demanding
firmly to be heard--so firmly that Mr. Harper, with a glance at him, sits down again; so firmly
that Mr. Speaker Doby, hypnotized by an eye, makes the blunder that will eventually cost him
his own head?

"The gentleman from Leith, Mr. Crewe."

As though sensing a drama, the mutterings were hushed once more. Mr. Jacob Botcher leaned forward,
and cracked his seat; but none, even those who had tasted of his hospitality, recognized that
the Black Knight had entered the lists--the greatest deeds of this world, and the heroes of
them, coming unheralded out of the plain clay. Mr. Crewe was the calmest man under the roof
as he saluted the Speaker, walked up to the clerk's desk, turned his back to it, and leaned
both elbows on it; and he regarded the sea of faces with the identical self-possession he had
exhibited when he had made his famous address on national affairs. He did not raise his voice
at the beginning, but his very presence seemed to compel silence, and curiosity was at fever
heat. What was he going to say?

"Gentlemen of the House," said Mr. Crewe, "I have listened to the gentleman from Putnam with
some--amusement. He has made the statement that he and his committee are giving to the Pingsquit
bill and other measures--some other measures--their undivided attention. Of this I have no
doubt whatever. He neglected to define the species of attention he is giving them--I should
define it as the kindly care which the warden of a penitentiary bestows upon his charges."

Mr. Crewe was interrupted here. The submerged four hundred and seventy had had time to rub
their eyes and get their breath, to realize that their champion had dealt Mr. Bascom a blow
to cleave his helm, and a roar of mingled laughter and exultation arose in the back seats,
and there was more craning to see the glittering eyes of the Honourable Brush and the expressions
of his two companions-in-arms. Mr. Speaker Doby beat the stone with his gavel, while Mr. Crewe
continued to lean back calmly until the noise was over.

"Gentlemen," he went on, "I will enter at the proper time into a situation--known, I believe,
to most of you--that brings about a condition of affairs by which the gentleman's committee,
or the gentleman himself, with his capacious pockets, does not have to account to the House
for every bill assigned to him by the Speaker. I have taken the trouble to examine a little
into the gentleman's past record--he has been chairman of such committees for years past, and
I find no trace that bills inimical to certain great interests have ever been reported back
by him. The Pingsquit bill involves the vital principle of competition. I have read it with
considerable care and believe it to be, in itself, a good measure, which deserves a fair hearing.
I have had no conversation whatever with those who are said to be its promoters. If the bill
is to pass, it has little enough time to get to the Senate. By the gentleman from Putnam's
own statement his committee have given it its share of attention, and I believe this House
is entitled to know the verdict, is entitled to accept or reject a report. I hope the motion
will prevail."

He sat down amidst a storm of applause which would have turned the head of a lesser man. No
such personal ovation had been seen in the House for years. How the Speaker got order; how
the Honourable Brush Bascom declared that Mr. Crewe would be called upon to prove his statements;
how Mr. Botcher regretted that a new member of such promise should go off at half-cock; how
Mr. Ridout hinted that the new member might think he had an animus; how Mr. Terry of Lee and
Mr. Widgeon of Hull denounced, in plain hill language, the Northeastern Railroads and lauded
the man of prominence who had the grit to oppose them, need not be gone into. Mr. Crewe at
length demanded the previous question, which was carried, and the motion was carried, too,
two hundred and fifty to one hundred and fifty-two. The House adjourned.

We will spare the blushes of the hero of this occasion, who was threatened with suffocation
by an inundation from the back seats. In answer to the congratulations and queries, he replied
modestly that nobody else seemed to have had the sand to do it, so he did it himself. He regarded
it as a matter of duty, however unpleasant and unforeseen; and if, as they said, he had been
a pioneer, education and a knowledge of railroads and the world had helped him. Whereupon,
adding tactfully that he desired the evening to himself to prepare for the battle of the morrow
(of which he foresaw he was to bear the burden), he extricated himself from his admirers and
made his way unostentatiously out of a side door into his sleigh. For the man who had kindled
a fire--the blaze of which was to mark an epoch--he was exceptionally calm. Not so the only
visitor whom Waters had instructions to admit that evening.

"Say, you hit it just right," cried the visitor, too exultant to take off his overcoat. "I've
been down through the Pelican, and there ain't been such excitement since Snow and Giddings
had the fight for United States senator in the '80's. The place is all torn up, and you can't
get a room there for love or money. They tell me they've been havin' conferences steady in
Number Seven since the session closed, and Hilary Vane's sent for all the Federal and State
office-holders to be here in the morning and lobby. Botcher and Jane and Bascom are circulatin'
like hot water, tellin' everybody that because they wouldn't saddle the State with a debt with
your bills you turned sour on 'em, and that you're more of a corporation and railroad man than
any of 'em. They've got their machine to working a thousand to the minute, and everybody they
have a slant on is going into line. One of them fellers, a conductor, told me he had to go
with 'em. But our boys ain't idle, I can tell you that. I was in the back of the gallery when
you spoke up, and I shook 'em off the leash right away."

Mr. Crewe leaned back from the table and thrust his hands in his pockets and smiled. He was
in one of his delightful moods.

"Take off your overcoat, Tooting," he said; "you'll find one of my best political cigars over
there, in the usual place."

"Well, I guessed about right, didn't I?" inquired Mr. Tooting, biting off one of the political
cigars. "I gave you a pretty straight tip, didn't I, that young Tom Gaylord was goin' to have
somebody make that motion to-day? But say, it's funny he couldn't get a better one than that
feller Harper. If you hadn't come along, they'd have smashed him to pulp. I'll bet the most
surprised man in the State to-night, next to Brush Bascom, is young Tom Gaylord. It's a wonder
he ain't been up here to thank you."

"Maybe he has been," replied Mr. Crewe. "I told Waters to keep everybody out to-night because
I want to know exactly what I'm going to say on the floor tomorrow. I don't want 'em to give
me trouble. Did you bring some of those papers with you?"

Mr. Tooting fished a bundle from his overcoat pocket. The papers in question, of which he had
a great number stored away in Ripton, represented the foresight, on Mr. Tooting's part, of
years. He was a young man with a praiseworthy ambition to get on in the world, and during his
apprenticeship in the office of the Honourable Hilary Vane many letters and documents had passed
through his hands. A less industrious person would have neglected the opportunity. Mr. Tooting
copied them; and some, which would have gone into the waste-basket, he laid carefully aside,
bearing in mind the adage about little scraps of paper--if there is one. At any rate, he now
had a manuscript collection which was unique in its way, which would have been worth much to
a great many men, and with characteristic generosity he was placing it at the disposal of Mr.
Crewe.

Mr. Crewe, in reading them, had other sensations. He warmed with indignation as an American
citizen that a man should sit in a mahogany office in New York and dictate the government of
a free and sovereign State; and he found himself in the grip of a righteous wrath when he recalled
what Mr. Flint had written to him. "As a neighbour, it will give me the greatest pleasure to
help you to the extent of my power, but the Northeastern Railroads cannot interfere in legislative
or political matters." The effrontery of it was appalling! Where, he demanded of Mr. Tooting,
did the common people come in? And this extremely pertinent question Mr. Tooting was unable
to answer.

But the wheels of justice had begun to turn.

Mr. Tooting had not exaggerated the tumult and affright at the Pelican Hotel. The private telephone
in Number Seven was busy all evening, while more or less prominent gentlemen were using continually
the public ones in the boxes in the reading room downstairs. The Feudal system was showing
what it could do, and the word had gone out to all the holders of fiefs that the vassals should
be summoned. The Duke of Putnam had sent out a general call to the office-holders in that county.
Theirs not to reason why--but obey; and some of them, late as was the hour, were already travelling
(free) towards the capital. Even the congressional delegation in Washington had received telegrams,
and sent them again to Federal office-holders in various parts of the State. If Mr. Crewe had
chosen to listen, he could have heard the tramp of armed men. But he was not of the metal to
be dismayed by the prospect of a great conflict. He was as cool as Cromwell, and after Mr.
Tooting had left him to take charge once more of his own armies in the yield, the genlemon
from Leith went to bed and slept soundly.

The day of the battle dawned darkly, with great flakes flying. As early as seven o'clock the
later cohorts began to arrive, and were soon as thick as bees in the Pelican, circulating in
the lobby, conferring in various rooms of which they had the numbers with occupants in bed
and out. A wonderful organization, that Feudal System, which could mobilize an army overnight!
And each unit of it, like the bee, working unselfishly for the good of the whole; like the
bee, flying straight for the object to be attained. Every member of the House from Putnam County,
for instance, was seen by one of these indefatigable captains, and if the member had a mortgage
or an ambition, or a wife and family that made life a problem, or a situation on the railroad
or in some of the larger manufacturing establishments, let him beware! If he lived in lodgings
in the town, he stuck his head out of the window to perceive a cheery neighbour from the country
on his doorstep. Think of a system which could do this, not for Putnam County alone, but for
all the counties in the State!

The Honourable Hilary Vane, captain-general of the Forces, had had but four hours' sleep, and
his Excellency, the Honourable Asa Gray, when he arose in the twilight of the morning, had
to step carefully to avoid the cigar butts on the floor which--like so many empty cartridge
shells were unpleasant reminders that a rebellion of no mean magnitude had arisen against the
power to which he owed allegiance, and by the favour of which he was attended with pomp and
circumstance wherever he chose to go.

Long before eleven o'clock the paths to the state-house were thronged with people. Beside the
office-holders and their friends who were in town, there were many residents of the capital
city in the habit of going to hear the livelier debates. Not that the powers of the Empire
had permitted debates on most subjects, but there could be no harm in allowing the lower House
to discuss as fiercely as they pleased dog and sheep laws and hedgehog bounties. But now! The
oldest resident couldn't remember a case of high treason and rebellion against the Northeastern
such as this promised to be, and the sensation took on an added flavour from the fact that
the arch rebel was a figure of picturesque interest, a millionaire with money enough to rent
the Duncan house and fill its long-disused stable with horses, who was a capitalist himself
and a friend of Mr. Flint's; of whom it was said that he was going to marry Mr. Flint's daughter!

Long before eleven, too, the chiefs over tens and the chiefs over hundreds had gathered their
men and marched them into the state-house; and Mr. Tooting, who was everywhere that morning,
noticed that some of these led soldiers had pieces of paper in their hands. The chaplain arose
to pray for guidance, and the House was crowded to its capacity, and the gallery filled with
eager and expectant faces--but the hero of the hour had not yet arrived. When at length he
did walk down the aisle, as unconcernedly as though he were an unknown man entering a theatre,
feminine whispers of "There he is!" could plainly be heard above the buzz, and simultaneous
applause broke out in spots, causing the Speaker to rap sharply with his gavel. Poor Mr. Speaker
Doby! He looked more like the mock-turtle than ever! and might have exclaimed, too, that once
he had been a real turtle: only yesterday, in fact, before he had made the inconceivable blunder
of recognizing Mr. Humphrey Crewe. Mr. Speaker Doby had spent a part of the night in room Number
Seven listening to things about himself. Herminius the unspeakable has given the enemy a foothold
in Rome.

Apparently unaware that he was the centre of interest, Mr. Crewe, carrying a neat little bag
full of papers, took his seat beside the Honourable Jacob Botcher, nodding to that erstwhile
friend as a man of the world should. And Mr. Botcher, not to be outdone, nodded back.

We shall skip over the painful interval that elapsed before the bill in question was reached:
painful, at least, for every one but Mr. Crewe, who sat with his knees crossed and his arms
folded. The hosts were facing each other, awaiting the word; the rebels prayerfully watching
their gallant leader; and the loyal vassals--whose wavering ranks had been added to overnight--with
their eyes on Mr. Bascom. And in justice to that veteran it must be said, despite the knock-out
blow he had received, that he seemed as debonair as ever.

       "Now while the three were tightening
        The harness on their backs."

Mr. Speaker Doby read many committee reports, and at the beginning of each there was a stir
of expectation that it might be the signal for battle. But at length he fumbled among his papers,
cleared away the lump in his throat, and glanced significantly at Mr. Bascom. Brush Bascom,
for the Committee.' Gentlemen, are you ready for the question? As many as are of opinion that
the report of the Committee should be adopted--the gentleman from Putnam, Mr. Bascom."

Again let us do exact justice, and let us not be led by our feelings to give a prejudiced account
of this struggle. The Honourable Brush Bascom, skilled from youth in the use of weapons, opened
the combat so adroitly that more than once the followers of his noble opponent winced and trembled.
The bill, Mr. Bascom said, would have been reported that day, anyway--a statement received
with mingled cheers and jeers. Then followed a brief and somewhat intimate history of the Gaylord
Lumber Company, not at all flattering to that corporation. Mr. Bascom hinted, at an animus:
there was no more need for a railroad in the Pingsquit Valley than there was for a merry-go-round
in the cellar of the state-house. (Loud laughter from everybody, some irreverent person crying
out that a merry-go-round was better than poker tables.) When Mr. Bascom came to discuss the
gentleman from Leith, and recited the names of the committees for which Mr. Crewe--in his desire
to be of service to the State had applied, there was more laughter, even amongst Mr. Crewe's
friends, and Mr. Speaker Doby relaxed so far as to smile sadly. Mr. Bascom laid his watch on
the clerk's desk and began to read the list of bills Mr. Crewe had introduced, and as this
reading proceeded some of the light-minded showed a tendency to become slightly hysterical.
Mr. Bascom said that he would like to see all those bills grow into laws,--with certain slight
changes,--but that he could not conscientiously vote to saddle the people with another Civil
War debt. It was well for the State, he hinted, that those committees were composed of stanch
men who would do their duty in all weathers, regardless of demagogues who sought to gratify
inordinate ambitions.

The hope of the revolutionists bore these strokes and others as mighty with complacency, as
though they had been so many playful taps; and while the battle surged hotly around him he
sat calmly listening or making occasional notes with a gold pencil. Born leader that he was,
he was biding his time. Mr. Bascom's attack was met valiantly, but unskillfully, from the back
seats. The Honourable Jacob Botcher arose, and filled the hall with extracts from the "Book
of Arguments"--in which he had been coached overnight by the Honourable Hilary Vane. Mr. Botcher's
tone towards his erstwhile friend was regretful,--a good man gone wrong through impulse and
inexperience.  "I am, sir," said Mr. Bascom to the Speaker, "sincerely sorry--sincerely sorry
that an individual of such ability as the member from Leith should be led, by the representations
of political adventurers and brigands and malcontents, into his present deplorable position
of criticising a State which is his only by adoption, the political conditions of which were
as sound and as free from corporate domination, sir, as those of any State in the broad Union."
(Loud cheers.) This appeal to State pride by Mr. Botches is a master stroke, and the friends
of the champion of the liberties of the people are beginning (some of them) to be a little
nervous and doubtful.

Following Mr. Botches were wild and scattering speeches from the back benches--unskillful and
pitiable counter-strokes. Where was the champion? Had he been tampered with overnight, and
persuaded of the futility of rebellion? Persuaded that his head would be more useful on his
own neck in the councils of the nation than on exhibition to the populace from the point of
a pike? It looks, to a calm spectator from the gallery, as though the rebel forces are growing
weaker and more demoralized every moment. Mr. Redbrook's speech, vehement and honest, helps
a little; people listen to an honest and forceful man, however he may lack technical knowledge,
but the majority of the replies are mere incoherent denunciations of the Northeastern Railroads.

On the other hand, the astounding discipline amongst the legions of the Empire excites the
admiration and despair even of their enemies; there is no random fighting here and breaking
of ranks to do useless hacking. A grave farmer with a beard delivers a short and temperate
speech (which he has by heart), mildly inquiring what the State would do without the Northeastern
Railroads; and the very moderation of this query coming from a plain and hard-headed agriculturist
(the boss of Grenville, if one but knew it!) has a telling effect. And then to cap the climax,
to make the attitude of the rebels even more ridiculous in the minds of thinking people, Mr.
Ridout is given the floor. Skilled in debate when he chooses to enter it, his knowledge of
the law only exceeded by his knowledge of how it is to be evaded--to Lartius is assigned the
task of following up the rout. And Mr. Crewe has ceased taking notes.

When the House leader and attorney for the Northeastern took his seat, the victory to all appearances
was won. It was a victory for conservatism and established order against sensationalism and
anarchy--Mr. Ridout had contrived to make that clear without actually saying so. It was as
if the Ute Indians had sought to capture Washington and conduct the government. Just as ridiculous
as that! The debate seemed to be exhausted, and the long-suffering Mr. Doby was inquiring for
the fiftieth time if the House were ready for the question, when Mr. Crewe of Leith arose and
was recognized. In three months he had acquired such a remarkable knowledge of the game of
parliamentary tactics as to be able, patiently, to wait until the bolt of his opponents had
been shot; and a glance sufficed to revive the drooping spirits of his followers, and to assure
them that their leader knew what he was about.

"Mr. Speaker," he said, "I have listened with great care to the masterly defence of that corporation
on which our material prosperity and civic welfare is founded (laughter); I have listened to
the gentleman's learned discussion of the finances of that road, tending to prove that it is
an eleemosynary institution on a grand scale. I do not wish to question unduly the intellects
of those members of this House who by their votes will prove that they have been convinced
by the gentleman's argument." Here Mr. Crewe paused and drew a slip of paper from his pocket
and surveyed the back seats. "But I perceive," he continued, "that a great interest has been
taken in this debate--so great an interest that since yesterday numbers of gentlemen have come
in from various parts of the State to listen to it (laughter and astonishment), gentlemen who
hold Federal and State offices. (Renewed laughter and searching of the House.) I repeat, Mr.
Speaker, that I do not wish to question the intellects of my fellow-members, but I notice that
many of them who are seated near the Federal and State office-holders in question have in their
hands slips of paper similar to this. And I have reason to believe that these slips were written
by somebody in room Number Seven of the Pelican Hotel." (Tremendous commotion, and craning
to see whether one's neighbour has a slip. The, faces of the redoubtable three a study.)

"I procured one of these slips," Mr. Crewe continued, "through a fellow-member who has no use
for it--whose intelligence, in fact, is underrated by the gentlemen in Number Seven. I will
read the slip.

"'Vote yes on the question. Yes means that the report of the Committee will be accepted, and
that the Pingsquit bill will not pass. Wait for Bascom's signal, and destroy this paper."'

There was no need, indeed, for Mr. Crewe to say any more than that--no need for the admirable
discussion of railroad finance from an expert's standpoint which followed to controvert Mr.
Ridout's misleading statements. The reading of the words on the slip of paper of which he had
so mysteriously got possession (through Mr. Hamilton Tooting) was sufficient to bring about
a disorder that for a full minute--Mr. Speaker Doby found it impossible to quell. The gallery
shook with laughter, and honourable members with slips of paper in their hands were made as
conspicuous as if they had been caught wearing dunces' caps.

It was then only, with belated wisdom, that Mr. Bascom and his two noble companions gave up
the fight, and let the horde across the bridge--too late, as we shall see. The populace, led
by a redoubtable leader, have learned their strength. It is true that the shining senatorial
twenty of the body-guard stand ready to be hacked to pieces at their posts before the Pingsquit
bill shall become a law; and should unutterable treason take place here, his Excellency is
prepared to be drawn and quartered rather than sign it. It is the Senate which, in this somewhat
inaccurate repetition of history, hold the citadel if not the bridge; and in spite of the howling
mob below their windows, scornfully refuse even to discuss the Pingsquit bill. The Honourable
Hilary Vane, whose face they study at dinner time, is not worried. Popular wrath does not continue
to boil, and many changes will take place in the year before the Legislature meets again.

This is the Honourable Hilary's public face. But are there not private conferences in room
Number Seven of which we can know nothing --exceedingly uncomfortable conferences for Horatius
and his companions? Are there not private telegrams and letters to the president of the Northeastern
in New York advising him that the Pingsquit bill has passed the House, and that a certain Mr.
Crewe is primarily responsible? And are there not queries--which history may disclose in after
years--as to whether Mr. Crewe's abilities as a statesman have not been seriously underrated
by those who should have been the first to perceive them? These are wonderful stimulants to the delicate child and should precede
the salt glow twice a week. Every afternoon a hot- and- cold foot bath
may be given to create a better circulation.

The feet are put in hot water from three to five minutes( as hot as
can be borne), and then they are quickly plunged into the coldest
water at obtainable for three seconds, then back into the hot water,
and vice versa, until three changes have been made,. Usually, his questions
are answered thoughtfully and without hesitancy, except along the
line of one thought-- that of sex.

Do not think for one moment
that he is satisfied by your evasive answers. You have but to recall
your own childhood experiences, and remember that today the moving
picture show and general public sentiment has always finishing the
treatment with the your cold dip.

On the three remaining days of the week at Mr half past three, the child
will simply relax in the hammock or on the porch couch while the mother
aids in the relaxation by a pleasant story. We would suggest that
on Monday the salt glow be administered; Tuesday a rest is taken;
Wednesday the soap shampoo is to be administered; Thursday another
rest; Friday a salt glow; Saturday another rest, and Sunday the shampoo,
etc. Before going to bed at night, with the mother' s hands well oiled
with either olive or sweet oil, the circulation is again stimulated
by the heavy friction rub.

Constipation is taken care of along the
same lines as mentioned elsewhere in this book. It is surprising to see how
often these delicate children are infested by worms, and while a
great deal of dependence cannot be put in that single symptom" grinding
the teeth at night," or" pallor around the mouth," yet we do believe
that many a delicate child continues to suffer from worms many years.

It is a very simple procedure to obtain a specimen of the stools.

A cathartic should be given and after usual free- bowel movement, the
second time the child desires to go to stool this should be saved and
taken to the laboratory for a careful search for worm eggs which are
usually in evidence if worms infest the child. The treatment for
worms is described elsewhere in this work.

We have seen scores of young people between the ages of eight and eleven who,
before treatment, were pale, listless, under weight, irritable and cross,
after three months of such treatment as has been outlined gain six
to ten pounds and look as ruddy as their healthiest neighborhood friends.
It is perfectly marvelous to notice how a child will put on from
six to eight pounds in a short period, at the same time overcoming
his irritableness and fretfulness.

I am more and more inclined to believe that most bad children are
sick children-- are undernourished children-- and it behooves us American
mothers and fathers to give proper attention to this undernourished
child, call a halt, and devote three months to giving him the help
that he needs.

He did not ask to come into this world; and it is" up to us" to give this child what he deserves--
for every child in this world has a right to be well born, to be well
fed, and to be well reared. CHAPTER XL TEACHING TRUTH We confidently
believe that most of the sex immorality seen in young people is more
or less the result of ignorance and curiosity; therefore we most earnestly
desire in this chapter to portray so interestingly the beautiful story
of life as seen in the vegetable and animal world, that our mother-
readers will be seized with the great desire wisely to convey to the
young child' s mind this sublime and beautiful story.

The questions most naturally arising in the of the reader at this
time are: When shall we begin to tell this story? How shall we tell
it? Where shall we begin?

Where shall we stop? Realizing full here yesterday, and one of them
must have dropped off, for it is right out there in the barn with old Bess
this minute." The mother was very busy with her papers and her reports,
and she let the incident pass with a smile, thinking it was a very
pretty little story.

A week later the six- year old brother came in saying: well that the subject is usually handled prematurely
and with unpreparedness, we will attempt in this chapter to discuss
it with courage and candor, believing that there is a right way, a
right time, and a right place to impart this information.

A LESSON FROM NATURE When the little folks are about three or four
years of age, when confidence and trust are at their height, they
often come to us begging for a" story;" and this is the golden opportunity
for the parent or caretaker to tell them the story of Mr. and Mrs.
Corn, and all their little babies; or Mr. and Mrs. Morning Glory and
their little folks.

There are a score of other equally interesting and instructive botanical
stories which are just as beautiful in their sublimity, and fairy-
like in their personality.

The little children' s eyes grow big with wonder as you tell the story
of a whole township of families by the name of Corn( See Fig. their little
people. If we could only get it into our heads for once and for all
that our children are born into this world veritable little thieves and
falsifiers, as well as adventurers and explorers, we would then cease
being so shocked and outraged by their frank statements of what they
have heard or have done.

Let the mother listen to all these things with calmness, while she
seeks to direct the child' s mind in pure and elevated channels--
to help him 17), who have their residences out in the wide country
fields.

We will first introduce the child to Mr. Corn, the tassel, waving
fortunate proudly and majestically in the breezes, and seeming to
say:" I am master of all I survey."

The little fellow is filled with wonderment as he learns how the clouds
give up their drops of water to quench his thirst and how the sun smiles upon him
to yellow his beard; and how the wonderful all- important pollen is
developed and ripened.

Often the child eagerly asks," And where, mamma, is Mrs. Corn?" and
to that interested upturned face we relate the pleasing story of the
beautiful silken tresses of Mother Corn.

Early in her life she is a beautiful shade of green, and as she thus gracefully
hangs out from the ear of corn, day by day the smiles of sunshine
turn this mother corn to brown, and then to a still darker shade." And
where, mamma, are the babies?" the child next inquires; and, as we
take the ear of corn, removing the outer clothing-- the husks-- we
find the underclothing, a much lighter shade of green, and here now
we are in close contact with the babies themselves-- the kernels--
and to each little kernel or baby corn we find mamma closely clinging.

Here is a beautiful opportunity to teach mother- love and mother watchfulness,
as also the opportunity to draw lessons from the baby kernels sitting
there in even rows, with their faces clean, silently contented-- just
doing their duty. The stories that may be told are limitless, and possibly
as interesting as are the myths and fairy- tales, yet all the while as
true as truth itself, with no fakery, no legends-- just simple truth.

THE ALL IMPORTANT POLLEN Now on a second trip into the cornfield, another story may be told of the important
work of the pollen. This" father part" of the plant falls upon the silken
tresses of the" mother part," by which the pollen is carried down
go back. I' d like to run away from home." The mother quietly drew
the boy to her side to the sleeping corn- baby seeds-- the kernels.
And when the" corn dust" does reach the sleeping seeds a great change
begins to take place.

This change is known to the adult as" impregnation;" to the little
child it may be presented as" an awakening" of the sleeping seeds, so
that they begin to grow, to develop, to expand and push out, until
we have the full- grown seeds seen in the delicious and juicy roasting
ear.

Sometimes, in the case of the larger plants and trees, Father Tree may be miles and miles away
from Mother Tree and so this all important pollen must be carried by the wind or by the bees, and as it
blows against the mother part of the plant- flower she catches it
and pushes it downward to the seed babies.

The wind scatters the pollen of the oak tree, the hazlenut, the walnut,
the birch, the willow and many others; for, without the good kind wind
or the bees, the pollen would never find its way to many a mother flower,
and the" fertilization" of the seed could not take place. THE MORNING
GLORY FAMILY Perhaps the story of life can be told as beautifully
from the morning- glory as from any other flower.

Here the beautiful flower cup is the home of Father and Mother Morning- Glory
and all their little babies.( See Fig. 18). As we carefully take away
their little home, the flower cup, we have left a little green cup,
and coming up from the center you will see five little stems, every
one of them wearing a hat of powder or pollen and this-- if you please--
is Papa Morning- Glory.

Look closely and you will see coming up from the center of these five stems(
stamens) one central stalk without a hat, Mother Morning- Glory, known in botany
as the" pistil"; and as you follow down this pistil you will find
an enlarged part at the base, which is known as the cradle- nest--
the home of the seed babies.

Little was known about this wonderful fertilization of the seeds
by the pollen two hundred years ago, and a whole century passed, before
the secret of the blossom and the bees was discovered; and even then
it was not fully realized how great was the work of the bees in cross-
fertilization.

Nor was it understood that the beautiful blossom of the flower, with its sweet nectar, was an exceedingly
important factor in attracting the bees. Another century passed before Darwin gave to the world the story
of the great work performed by the bees in cross- fertilization--
in carrying the pollen from flower to flower, for it is now a well-
known fact that all of the blossoms visited by the bees produce better
fruit and better flowers.

In the flower where the father and mother part matures at the same time, self- fertilization is the rule.
Cross- fertilization occurs in instances where either the father part
or mother part ripen at different times, in these cases the pollen
is carried from plant to plant by the wind or by the nectar- seeking
bees.

These busy bees, with their fluffy little feet and fuzzy coats, become completely covered with this
all- important flower dust, and in seeking nectar from other flowers
they leave the" awakening dust" behind, and thus cross- fertilization
takes place; new types of babies are produced, new generations of
fruits and flowers.

HOW MOTHER NATURE WORKS Dr. Chadwick, in her Blossom Babies, gives her children, and in every
conceivable way she sees to it that her plant- seeds are fertilized and
distributed. We are all familiar with the dandelion and the thistle and a
host of others which fly through the air with actual plumes, some
seeds fly with wings, such as the maple; other seeds travel by clinging
or sticking, such as the cockle burr; still others float and us a
beautiful recital concerning the fertilization of plants, which provides
an endless number of interesting stories.

The water plants are very interesting in that the pollen is just
light enough to float on the exact level of the mother part of the
flower, otherwise fertilization could never take place, and there
would be no more lovely lilies.

Long throated blossoms are fertilized by their attraction for certain moths
or humming birds who have long tongues. Mother Nature is exceedingly careful
to reproduce shoot; while we all know about a lot of seeds that are
good to eat, such as the nuts and fruits, as well as many of the grains,
such as corn, etc. An incubator about hatching time is a wonderful
object lesson in teaching the story of life.

Take the children to visit one and let them actually see the live baby
chicks coming forth from the seed- shells. Other wonderful lessons
may be drawn from the mother horse or the mother cow; and it is impossible
to portray the close companionship, the sublime trust and confidence,
which exists between the mother and the child who have been bound
together by these ties and sentiments of truthfulness, trustfulness,
and frankness.

THE SALMON FAMILY The little fellow is daily learning that everything that grows comes from a seed,
even the salmon which was eaten at lunch yesterday was the text for an impressive story about Papa and
Mamma Salmon. In the beautiful Columbia river Mother Salmon is swimming about quietly seeking
a shallow place in the stream until Father Salmon, swimming by, is
attracted to the spot and, hesitating, talks something like this to
himself:" Why the idea, here are some helpless fish- baby seeds, they
can' t grow and develop without me, here they are sound asleep;" and,
nestling over them, he contributes the self- same and all important"
something"-- comparable to the pollen of the plants-- which wakes
them up.

In the case of the fish the" awakening" substance is not in the form of
a powder as in the plant world; but is in the form of a semi- liquid
mass, much resembling the white of an egg. The little seeds soon begin
to tremble-- begin to wake up-- and then begin to swell and grow
and develop.

In a few days what do you suppose happens to these little bulging baby
seeds? The very same thing that happened to the chick seed-- they burst
and out come hundreds of cute little fish minnows.

In just a few hours they are all swimming about in a most wonderful fish- like manner. EARLY QUESTIONS
Some day you will be surprised by your little child suddenly asking you some such question as this:"
Mother, where did I come from?" while in the same frank manner you
reply:" Why from your mamma, of course; where do you think you could
have come from?

Everything that grows comes from its mamma-- oranges, apples, radishes,
cabbages, cats, dogs, and chickies-- everything that grows has to
have a mamma and papa," and they are often satisfied this answer for
a long time.

No child should go to kindergarten without knowing that he came from
his mother, and this knowledge should come to him from his own mother'
s lips. These are different days than those in which our grandmothers
lived.

The spirit of investigation and of inquiry is in the air. The moving- picture show makes it necessary for children
of nine or ten to understand these things-- to have a knowledge of certain
of the conventionalities of life. Twenty years ago this may not have
been so necessary-- the youth of that day might have waited several
years longer for certain phases of his sex instruction.

It
is highly important that this knowledge be obtained from a wise and
pure and sympathetic mind-- from the child' s own parents.

One mother put her little girl' s questions off week after week,
saying:" I will tell you when you get older, dear-- no, not now,
dear; run away, you are not old enough to know such things, you must
forget about them taken." Thus the unprepared mother sought to gain
time in which to consult the doctor or the library. Finally the day came
when the mother felt that she was wise to answer the query," Where
did I come from," and so with her heart in her throat she approached
her daughter, saying:" Come, Mary, mother is going to tell you all
about it.

I am now ready
to answer your question." Imagine her surprise and astonishment
when Mary said:" Oh, you needn' t mind, mother, Kate told me all
about it last week."

Now the question in my mind is: how did Kate tell her? How much unnecessary
information did this older and experienced Kate put into the pure mind of this
innocent little girl?

ONE MOTHER' S AWAKENING One mother in a western state-- a county superintendent of schools--
told us the following interesting story of her own experience, which we think
may be of help to some of our mother readers. One morning her seven- year
old son rushed into the house exclaiming:" Oh, mother, there is a new calf
out in the barn, and I know where it came from; I saw a wagon load
of calves come by"

Mother, I think there must have been another wagon load of calves passed
by, and one must have been lost off, for old Nell is cleaning up
a little calf out in the barn for all she is worth," while the older
brother piped up:" Sure, it was another load of calves; that is just
exactly the way the other calf got here;" and the two little fellows
went off to school.

About a month later that county superintendent suddenly became a
much wiser mother than she was before, although her heart was made
to ache.

Both boys came
home from school one day and the older one met her with something
like this:" I am mad! I' ve been lied to; all the fellows at school say
I have, and they are making sport of me, too," and with a glare in
his reddened eye he continued," You know that new calf did not come off
that wagon; you know that calf came from old Bess herself; all the
fellows say so at school, and they are making all kinds of fun of
me, and I don' t want to and reminded him that she had simply listened;
that she had not opened her mouth; that he came into the room and
told about the incident himself, but this did not satisfy him.

He turned to her wounded and crushed, saying:" Well, you let a fellow
believe it, and that' s just as bad;" and this educated mother-- this
trusted. custodian of a county full of school children-- beseeched
me to warn mothers everywhere to teach their children the truth, and
to never let a child go to school with a sex misunderstanding.

     She told me that it took her six months to get that boy' s confidence
back again. DON' T GET SHOCKED I believe that many mothers make the
sad mistake of showing the child that they are shocked by trivial sayings
and trifling experiences of upward by imparting" precept upon precept;
here a little and there a little." Children will come in with stories that
at first thought do greatly shock the parent; but under no circumstances
should the boy or girl discover that the parent is shocked, for if
he does he will not likely come again with another such" shocking"
difficulty.

One mother told me that her seven- year- old boy, beginning third grade, came into where she may deposit
her cluster of baby seeds, which looks very much like a mass of tapioca pudding
as they gently sink to the bed of a shallow spot in the river. There
they lay" sound asleep" her bedroom one morning saying:" Mother, I am just
busting to say something," and this mother very wisely said," Well, say it;
certainly I don' t want you to burst," and she told me that this
boy whispered to her three of the filthiest words that he could possibly
have heard on the streets.

In relating this experience to me she said:" Do you know, doctor, that
I really did not know what to think at first, but I remembered that you
had taught me never to be shocked, and so I looked up and asked:" Do you
feel better?" whereupon he breathed a big sigh and exclaimed:" What a relief!
I have just been busting to say that to somebody." Mother, to whom
would you rather he would say these things? to you, or to some little
girl out on the street, or to some older boy?

Think what trouble and possible mischief
were avoided by whispering into the sympathetic ear of mother. This wise mother
turned to that little boy and said:" Son, that ear is always waiting for just
such things and whenever you feel like saying something-- like getting
it off your mind-- you just come to me;" and he came repeatedly.

One time he came in saying:" I don' t know whether you want me to
play with Harold or not; he does some of those things you told me
about the other day."

And the mother thoughtfully and wisely looked up and said:" Did he
do it in front of his mother? Why of course he didn' t. Did he ask you
to go into the bedroom or bathroom and lock the door?" and the little
fellow quickly answered:" Why sure he did; how did you guess it?" and added"
now I suppose you are not going to let me play with him any more,"
and this wise mother, knowing that if she denied him this privilege
that it would quite likely be frequently sought, said:" Why, certainly
play with Harold in the open, but whenever he suggests secrecy--"
she did not have time to finish the sentence, the boy said:" I am
wise; whenever he gets to doing that' funny business' I' ll skiddoo."

The confidence between that mother and son, to my mind, was wonderfully
sublime-- all the while practical and helpful in his daily training. DON'
T REPULSE THE CHILD A little older child sees the fowls, the dogs,
or the cats," mating," and then, rushing into the house, inquires
what it is all about; and unless the mother is on her guard some older
member of the family may show surprise and thus thoughtlessly convey
to the child' s mind that his question is improper and entirely out
of place.

To the question," What are they doing, mamma?" quietly answer," Just mating, dear, just as the flowers
mate; everything that lives or grows comes as the result of mating." Suppose that you were repulsed
every time you approached a dear friend, your husband, or some other member of the
family? Take, for instance, the matter of a caress or an embrace--
how would you react to repeated rebuff? And so with the little child;
he comes into this world full of confidence and trust, full of wonder
and curiosity; possessed with the spirit of exploration and investigation--
everywhere and all the time he asks questions placed the age for such
knowledge from one to five years earlier in this generation than in
the past.

 The overwhelming compliment
of a request from such gentlemen must be treated in the nature of a command--and yet he had
hesitated for several weeks, during which period he had cast about for another more worthy
of the honour. Then followed a somewhat technical and (to the lay mind) obscure recapitulation
of the iniquities the Northeastern was committing, which proved beyond peradventure that Mr.
Crewe knew what he was talking about; such phrases as "rolling stock," "milking the road"--an
imposing array of facts and figures. Mr. Crewe made it plain that he was a man who "did things."
And if it were the will of Heaven that he became governor, certain material benefits would
as inevitably ensue as the day follows the night. The list of the material benefits, for which
there was a crying need, bore a strong resemblance to a summary of the worthy measures upon
which Mr. Crewe had spent so much time and labour in the last Legislature.

Austen laid down the paper, leaned back in his chair, and thrust his hands in his pockets,
and with a little vertical pucker in his forehead, regarded his friend.

"What do you think of that?" Tom demanded. "Now, what do you think of it?"

"I think," said Austen, "that he'll scare the life out of the Northeastern before he gets through
with them."

"What!" exclaimed Tom, incredulously. He had always been willing to accept Austen's judgment
on men and affairs, but this was pretty stiff. "What makes you think so?"

"Well, people don't know Mr. Crewe, for one thing. And they are beginning to have a glimmer
of light upon the Railroad."

"Do you mean to say he has a chance for the nomination?"

"I don't know. It depends upon how much the voters find out about him before the convention."

Tom sat down rather heavily.

"You could have been governor," he complained reproachfully, "by raising your hand. You've
got more ability than any man in the State, and you sit here gazin' at that mountain and lettin'
a darned fool millionaire walk in ahead of you."

Austen rose and crossed over to Mr. Gaylord's chair, and, his hands still in his pockets, looked
down thoughtfully into that gentleman's square and rugged face.

"Tom," he said, "there's no use discussing this delusion of yours, which seems to be the only
flaw in an otherwise sane character. We must try to keep it from the world."

Tom laughed in spite of himself.

"I'm hanged if I understand you," he declared, "but I never did. You think Crewe and Tooting
may carry off the governorship, and you don't seem to care."

"I do care," said Austen, briefly. He went to the window and stood for a moment with his back
to his friend, staring across at Sawanec. Tom had learned by long experience to respect these
moods, although they were to him inexplicable. At length Austen turned.

"Tom," he said, "can you come in to-morrow about this time? If you can't, I'll go to your office
if you will let me know when you'll be in. There's a matter of business I want to talk to you
about."

Tom pulled out his watch.

"I've got to catch a train for Mercer," he replied, "but I will come in in the morning and
see you."

A quarter of an hour later Austen went down the narrow wooden flight of stairs into the street,
and as he emerged from the entry almost bumped into the figure of a young man that was hurrying
by. He reached out and grasped the young man by the collar, pulling him up so short as almost
to choke him.

"Hully gee!" cried the young man whose progress had been so rudely arrested. "Great snakes!"
(A cough.) "What're you tryin' to do? Oh," (apologetically) "it's you, Aust. Let me go. This
day ain't long enough for me. Let me go."

Austen kept his grip and regarded Mr. Tooting thoughtfully.

"I want to speak to you, Ham," he said; "better come upstairs."

"Say, Aust, on the dead, I haven't time. Pardriff's waitin' for some copy now."

"Just for a minute, Ham," said Austen; "I won't keep you long."

"Leggo my collar, then, if you don't want to choke me. Say, I don't believe you know how strong
you are."

"I didn't know you wore a collar any more, Ham," said Austen.

Mr. Tooting grinned in appreciation of this joke.

"You must think you've got one of your Wild West necktie parties on," he gasped. "I'll come.
But if you love me, don't let the boys in Hilary's office see me."

"They use the other entry," answered Austen, indicating that Mr. Tooting should go up first--which
he did. When they reached the office Austen shut the door, and stood with his back against
it, regarding Mr. Tooting thoughtfully.

At first Mr. Tooting returned the look with interest swagger--aggression would be too emphatic,
and defiance would not do. His was the air, perhaps, of Talleyrand when he said, "There seems
to be an inexplicable something in me that brings bad luck to governments that neglect me:"
the air of a man who has made a brilliant coup d'etat. All day he had worn that air--since
five o'clock in the morning, when he had sprung from his pallet. The world might now behold
the stuff that was in Hamilton Tooting. Power flowed out of his right hand from an inexhaustible
reservoir which he had had the sagacity to tap, and men leaped into action at his touch. He,
the once, neglected, had the destiny of a State in his keeping.

Gradually, however, it became for some strange reason difficult to maintain that aggressive
stare upon Austen Vane, who shook his head slowly.

"Ham, why did you do it?" he asked.

"Why?" cried Mr. Tooting, fiercely biting back a treasonable smile. "Why not? Ain't he the
best man in the State to make a winner? Hasn't he got the money, and the brains, and the get-up-and-git?
Why, it's a sure thing. I've been around the State, and I know the sentiment. We've got 'em
licked, right now. What have you got against it? You're on our side, Aust."

"Ham," said Austen, "are you sure you have the names and addresses of those twenty prominent
citizens right, so that any voter may go out and find 'em?"

"What are you kidding about, Aust?" retorted Mr. Tooting, biting back the smile again. "Say,
you never get down to business with me. You don't blame Crewe for comin' out, do you?"

"I don't see how Mr. Crewe could have resisted such an overwhelming demand," said Austen. "He
couldn't shirk such a duty. He says so himself, doesn't he?"

"Oh, go on!" exclaimed Mr. Tooting, who was not able to repress a grin.

"The letter of the twenty must have been a great surprise to Mr. Crewe. He says he was astonished.
Did the whole delegation go up to Leith, or only a committee?"

Mr. Tooting's grin had by this time spread all over his face--a flood beyond his control.

"Well, there's no use puffin' it on with you, Aust. That was done pretty slick, that twenty-prominent-citizen
business, if I do say it myself. But you don't know that feller Crewe--he's a full-size cyclone
when he gets started, and nothin' but a range of mountains could stop him."

"It must be fairly exciting to--ride him, Ham."

"Say, but it just is. Kind of breathless, though. He ain't very well known around the State,
and he was bound to run--and I just couldn't let him come out without any clothes on."

"I quite appreciate your delicacy, Ham."

Mr. Tooting's face took on once more a sheepish look, which changed almost immediately to one
of disquietude.

"Say, I'll come back again some day and kid with you. I've got to go, Aust--that's straight.
This is my busy day."

"Wouldn't you gain some time if you left by the window?" Austen asked.

At this suggestion Mr. Tooting's expressive countenance showed genuine alarm.

"Say, you ain't going to put up any Wild West tricks on me, are you? I heard you nearly flung
Tom Gaylord out of the one in the other room."

"If this were a less civilized place, Ham, I'd initiate you into what is known as the bullet
dance. As it is, I have a great mind to speed you on your way by assisting you downstairs."

Mr. Hamilton Tooting became ashy pale.

"I haven't done anything to you, Aust. Say--you didn't--?" He did not finish.

Terrified by something in Austen's eye, which may or may not have been there at the time of
the Blodgett incident, Mr. Tooting fled without completing his inquiry. And, his imagination
being great, he reproduced for himself such a vivid sensation of a bullet-hole in his spine
that he missed his footing near the bottom, and measured his length in the entry. Such are
the humiliating experiences which sometimes befall the Talleyrands--but rarely creep into their
biographies.

Austen, from the top of the stairway, saw this catastrophe, but did not smile. He turned on
his heel, and made his way slowly around the corner of the passage into the other part of the
building, and paused at the open doorway of the Honourable Hilary's outer office. By the street
windows sat the Honourable Brush Bascom, sphinx-like, absorbing wisdom and clouds of cigar
smoke which emanated from the Honourable Nat Billings.

"Howdy, Austen?" said Brush, genially, lookin' for the Honourable Hilary? Flint got up from
New York this morning, and sent for him a couple of hours ago. He'll be back at two."

"Have you read the pronunciamento?" inquired Mr. Billings. "Say, Austen, knowin' your sentiments,
I wonder you weren't one of the twenty prominent citizens."

"All you anti-railroad fellers ought to get together," Mr. Bascom suggested; "you've got us
terrified since your friend from Leith turned the light of publicity on us this morning. I
hear Ham Tooting's been in and made you an offer."

News travels fast in Ripton.

"Austen kicked him downstairs," said Jimmy Towle, the office boy, who had made a breathless
entrance during the conversation, and felt it to be the psychological moment to give vent to
the news with which he was bursting.

"Is that straight?" Mr. Billings demanded. He wished he had done it himself. "Is that straight?"
he repeated, but Austen had gone.

"Of course it's straight," said Jimmy Towle, vigorously. A shrewd observer of human nature,
he had little respect for Senator Billings. "Ned Johnson saw him pick himself up at the foot
of Austen's stairway."

The Honourable Brush's agate eyes caught the light, and he addressed Mr. Billings in a voice
which, by dint of long training, only carried a few feet.

"There's the man the Northeastern's got to look out for," he said. "The Humphrey Crewes don't
count. But if Austen Vane ever gets started, there'll be trouble. Old man Flint's got some
such idea as that, too. I overheard him givin' it to old Hilary once, up at Fairview, and Hilary
said he couldn't control him. I guess nobody else can control him. I wish I'd seen him kick
Ham downstairs."

"I'd like to kick him downstairs," said Mr. Billings, savagely biting off another cigar.

"I guess you hadn't better try it, Nat," said Mr. Bascom.

Meanwhile Austen had returned to his own office, and shut the door. His luncheon hour came
and went, and still he sat by the open window gazing out across the teeming plain, and up the
green valley whence the Blue came singing from the highlands. In spirit he followed the water
to Leith, and beyond, where it swung in a wide circle and hurried between wondrous hills like
those in the backgrounds of the old Italians: hills of close-cropped pastures, dotted with
shapely sentinel oaks and maples which cast sharp, rounded shadows on the slopes at noonday;
with thin fantastic elms on the gentle sky-lines, and forests massed here and there--silent,
impenetrable hills from a story-book of a land of mystery. The river coursed between them on
its rocky bed, flinging its myriad gems to the sun. This was the Vale of the Blue, and she
had touched it with meaning for him, and gone.

He drew from his coat a worn pocket-book, and from the pocket-book a letter. It was dated in
New York in February, and though he knew it by heart he found a strange solace in the pain
which it gave him to reread it. He stared at the monogram on the paper, which seemed so emblematic
of her; for he had often reflected that her things--even such minute insignia as this--belonged
to her. She impressed them not only with her taste, but with her character. The entwined letters,
Y. F., of the design were not, he thought, of a meaningless, frivolous daintiness, but stood
for something. Then he read the note again. It was only a note.

   "MY DEAR MR. VANE: I have come back to find my mother ill, and I am
   taking her to France. We are sailing, unexpectedly, to-morrow,
   there being a difficulty about a passage later. I cannot refrain
   from sending you a line before I go to tell you that I did you an
   injustice. You will no doubt think it strange that I should write
   to you, but I shall be troubled until it is off my mind. I am
   ashamed to have been so stupid. I think I know now why you would
   not consent to be a candidate, and I respect you for it.

                    "Sincerely your friend,

                    "VICTORIA FLINT."

What did she know? What had she found out? Had she seen her father and talked to him? That
was scarcely possible, since her mother had been ill and she had left at once. Austen had asked
himself these questions many times, and was no nearer the solution. He had heard nothing of
her since, and he told himself that perhaps it was better, after all, that she was still away.
To know that she was at Fairview, and not to be able to see her, were torture indeed.

The note was formal enough, and at times he pretended to be glad that it was. How could it
be otherwise? And why should he interpret her interest in him in other terms than those in
which it was written? She had a warm heart--that he knew; and he felt for her sake that he
had no right to wish for more than the note expressed. After several unsuccessful attempts;
he had answered it in a line, "I thank you, and I understand."

CHAPTER XVI

THE "BOOK OF ARGUMENTS" IS OPENED

The Honourable Hilary Vane returned that day from Fairview in no very equable frame of mind.
It is not for us to be present at the Councils on the Palatine when the "Book of Arguments"
is opened, and those fitting the occasion are chosen and sent out to the faithful who own printing-presses
and free passes. The Honourable Hilary Vane bore away from the residence of his emperor a great
many memoranda in an envelope, and he must have sighed as he drove through the leafy roads
for Mr. Hamilton Tooting, with his fertile mind and active body. A year ago, and Mr. Tooting
would have seized these memoranda of majesty, and covered their margins with new suggestions:
Mr. Tooting, on occasions, had even made additions to the "Book of Arguments" itself--additions
which had been used in New York and other States with telling effect against Mr. Crewes there.
Mr. Tooting knew by heart the time of going to press of every country newspaper which had passes
(in exchange for advertising!). It was two o'clock when the Honourable Hilary reached his office,
and by three all the edicts would have gone forth, and the grape-shot and canister would have
been on their way to demolish the arrogance of this petty Lord of Leith..

"Tooting's a dangerous man, Vane. You oughtn't to have let him go," Mr. Flint had said. "I
don't care a snap of my finger for the other fellow."

How Mr. Tooting's ears would have burned, and how his blood would have sung with pride to have
heard himself called dangerous by the president of the Northeastern!

He who, during all the valuable years of his services, had never had a sign that that potentate
was cognizant of his humble existence.

The Honourable Brush Bascom, as we know, was a clever man; and although it had never been given
him to improve on the "Book of Arguments," he had ideas of his own. On reading Mr. Crewe's
defiance that morning, he had, with characteristic promptitude and a desire to be useful, taken
the first train out of Putnam for Ripton, to range himself by the side of the Honourable Hilary
in the hour of need. The Feudal System anticipates, and Mr. Bascom did not wait for a telegram.

On the arrival of the chief counsel from Fairview other captains had put in an appearance,
but Mr. Bascom alone was summoned, by a nod, into the private office. What passed between them
seems too sacred to write about. The Honourable Hilary would take one of the slips from the
packet and give it to Mr. Bascom.

"If that were recommended, editorially, to the Hull Mercury, it might serve to clear away certain
misconceptions in that section.

"Certain," Mr. Bascom would reply.

"It has been thought wise," the Honourable Hilary continued, "to send an annual to the Groveton
News. Roberts, his name is. Suppose you recommend to Mr. Roberts that an editorial on this
subject would be timely."

Slip number two. Mr. Bascom marks it 'Roberts.' Subject: "What would the State do without the
Railroad?"

"And Grenville, being a Prohibition centre, you might get this worked up for the Advertiser there."

Mr. Bascom's agate eyes are full of light as he takes slip number three. Subject: "Mr. Humphrey
Crewe has the best-stocked wine cellar in the State, and champagne every night for dinner."
Slip number four, taken direct from the second chapter of the "Book of Arguments": "Mr. Crewe
is a reformer because he has been disappointed in his inordinate ambitions," etc. Slip number
five: "Mr. Crewe is a summer resident, with a house in New York," etc., etc.

Slip number six, "Book of Arguments," paragraph, chapter: "Humphrey Crewe, Defamer of our State."
Assigned, among others, to the Ripton Record.

"Paul Pardriff went up to Leith to-day," said Mr. Bascom.

"Go to see him," replied the Honourable Hilary. "I've been thinking for some time that the
advertising in the Ripton Record deserves an additional annual."

Mr. Bascom, having been despatched on this business, and having voluntarily assumed control
of the Empire Bureau of Publication, the chief counsel transacted other necessary legal business
with State Senator Billings and other gentlemen who were waiting. At three o'clock word was
sent in that Mr. Austen Vane was outside, and wished to speak with his father as soon as the
latter was at leisure. Whereupon the Honourable Hilary shooed out the minor clients, leaned
back in his chair, and commanded that his son be admitted.

"Judge," said Austen, as he closed the door behind him, "I don't want to bother you."

The Honourable Hilary regarded his son for a moment fixedly out of his little eyes.

"Humph" he said.

Austen looked down at his father. The Honourable Hilary's expression was not one which would
have aroused, in the ordinary man who beheld him, a feeling of sympathy or compassion: it was
the impenetrable look with which he had faced his opponents for many years. But Austen felt
compassion.

"Perhaps I'd better come in another time--when you are less busy," he suggested.

"Who said I was busy?" inquired the Honourable Hilary.

Austen smiled a little sadly. One would have thought, by that smile, that the son was the older
and wiser of the two.

"I didn't mean to cast any reflection on your habitual industry, Judge," he said.

"Humph!" exclaimed Mr. Vane. "I've got more to do than sit in the window and read poetry, if
that's what you mean."

"You never learned how to enjoy life, did you, Judge?" he said. "I don't believe you ever really
had a good time. Own up."

"I've had sterner things to think about. I've had 'to earn my living --and give you a good time."

"I appreciate it," said Austen.

"Humph! Sometimes I think you don't show it a great deal," the Honourable Hilary answered.

"I show it as far as I can, Judge," said his son. "I can't help the way I was made."

"I try to take account of that," said the Honourable Hilary.

Austen laughed.

"I'll drop in to-morrow morning," he said.

But the Honourable Hilary pointed to a chair on the other side of the desk.

"Sit down. To-day's as good as to-morrow," he remarked, with sententious significance, characteristically
throwing the burden of explanation on the visitor.

Austen found the opening unexpectedly difficult. He felt that this was a crisis in their relations,
and that it had come at an unfortunate hour.

"Judge," he said, trying to control the feeling that threatened to creep into his voice, "we
have jogged along for some years pretty peaceably, and I hope you won't misunderstand what
I'm going to say."

The Honourable Hilary grunted.

"It was at your request that I went into the law. I have learned to like that profession. I
have stuck to it as well as my wandering, Bohemian nature will permit, and while I do not expect
you necessarily to feel any pride in such progress as I have made, I have hoped--that you might
feel an interest."

The Honourable Hilary grunted again.

"I suppose I am by nature a free-lance," Austen continued. "You were good enough to acknowledge
the force of my argument when I told you it would be best for me to strike out for myself.
And I suppose it was inevitable, such being the case, and you the chief counsel for the Northeastern
Railroads, that I should at some time or another be called upon to bring suits against your
client. It would have been better, perhaps, if I had not started to practise in this State.
I did so from what I believe was a desire common to both of us to--to live together."

The Honourable Hilary reached for his Honey Dew, but he did not speak.

"To live together," Austen repeated. "I want to say that, if I had gone away, I believe I should
always have regretted the fact." He paused, and took from his pocket a slip of paper.  "I made
up my mind from the start that I would always be frank with you. In spite of my desire to amass
riches, there are some suits against the Northeastern which I have --somewhat quixotically--refused.
Here is a section of the act which permitted the consolidation of the Northeastern Railroads.
You are no doubt aware of its existence."

The Honourable Hilary took the slip of paper in his hand and stared at it. "The rates for fares
and freights existing at the time of the passage of this act shall mot be increased on the
roads leased or united under it." What his sensations were when he read it no man might have
read in his face, but his hand trembled a little, and along silence ensued before he gave it
back to his son with the simple comment:--"Well?"

"I do not wish to be understood to ask your legal opinion, although you probably know that
lumber rates have been steadily raised, and if a suit under that section were successful the
Gaylord Lumber Company could recover a very large sum of money from the Northeastern Railroads,"
said Austen. "Having discovered the section, I believe it to be my duty to call it to the attention
of the Gaylords. What I wish to know is, whether my taking the case would cause you any personal
inconvenience or distress? If so, I will refuse it."

"No," answered the Honourable Hilary, "it won't. Bring suit. Much use it'll be. Do you expect
they can recover under that section?"

"I think it is worth trying," said Austen.

"Why didn't somebody try it before?" asked the Honourable Hilary.

"See here, Judge, I wish you'd let me out of an argument about it. Suit is going to be brought,
whether I bring it or another man. If you would prefer for any reason that I shouldn't bring
it--I won't. I'd much rather resign as counsel for the Gaylords--and I am prepared to do so."

"Bring suit," answered the Honourable Hilary, quickly, "bring suit by all means. And now's
your time. This seems to be a popular season for attacking the property which is the foundation
of the State's prosperity." ("Book of Arguments," chapter 3.)

In spite of himself, Austen smiled again. Long habit had accustomed Hilary Vane to put business
considerations before family ties; and this habit had been the secret of his particular success.
And now, rather than admit by the least sign the importance of his son's discovery of the statute
(which he had had in mind for many years, and to which he had more than once, by the way, called
Mr. Flint's attention), the Honourable Hilary deliberately belittled the matter as part and
parcel of the political tactics against the Northeastern.

Sears caused by differences of opinion are soon healed; words count for nothing, and it is
the soul that attracts or repels. Mr. Vane was not analytical, he had been through a harassing
day, and he was unaware that it was not Austen's opposition, but Austen's smile, which set
the torch to his anger. Once, shortly after his marriage, when he had come home in wrath after
a protracted quarrel with Mr. Tredway over the orthodoxy of the new minister, in the middle
of his indignant recital of Mr. Tredway's unwarranted attitude, Sarah Austen had smiled. The
smile had had in it, to be sure, nothing of conscious superiority, but it had been utterly
inexplicable to Hilary Vane. He had known for the first time what it was to feel murder in
the heart, and if he had not rushed out of the room, he was sure he would have strangled her.
After all, the Hilary Vanes of this world cannot reasonably be expected to perceive the humour
in their endeavours.

Now the son's smile seemed the reincarnation of the mother's. That smile was in itself a refutation
of motive on Austen's part which no words could have made more emphatic; it had in it (unconsciously,
too) compassion for and understanding of the Honourable Hilary's mood and limitations. Out
of the corner of his mental vision--without grasping it--the Honourable Hilary perceived this
vaguely. It was the smile in which a parent privately indulges when a child kicks his toy locomotive
because its mechanism is broken. It was the smile of one who, unforgetful of the scheme of
the firmament and the spinning planets, will not be moved to anger by him who sees but the
four sides of a pit.

Hilary Vane grew red around the eyes--a danger signal of the old days.

"Take the suit," he said. "If you don't, I'll make it known all over the State that you started
it. I'll tell Mr. Flint to-morrow. Take it, do you hear me? You ask me if I have any pride
in you. I answer, yes. I'd like to see what you can do. I've done what I could for you, and
now I wash my hands of you. Go,--ruin yourself if you want to. You've always been headed that
way, and there's no use trying to stop you. You don't seem to have any notion of decency or
order, or any idea of the principle on which this government was based. Attack property destroy
it. So much the better for you and your kind. Join the Humphrey Crewes--you belong with 'em.
Give those of us who stand for order and decency as much trouble as you can. Brand us as rascals
trying to enrich ourselves with politics, and proclaim yourselves saints nobly striving to
get back the rights of the people. If you don't bring that suit, I tell you I'll give you the
credit for it--and I mean what I say."

Austen got to his feet. His own expression, curiously enough, had not changed to one of anger.
His face had set, but his eyes held the look that seemed still to express compassion, and what
he felt was a sorrow that went to the depths of his nature. What he had so long feared--what
he knew they had both feared--had come at last.

"Good-by, Judge," he said.

Hilary Vane stared at him dumbly. His anger had not cooled, his eyes still flamed, but he suddenly
found himself bereft of speech. Austen put his hand on his father's shoulder, and looked down
silently into his face. But Hilary was stiff as in a rigour, expressionless save for the defiant
red in his eye.

"I don't think you meant all that, Judge, and I don't intend to hold it against you."

Still Hilary stared, his lips in the tight line which was the emblem of his character, his
body rigid. He saw his son turn and walk to the door, and turn again with his handle on the
knob, and Hilary did not move. The door closed, and still he sat there, motionless, expressionless.

Austen was hailed by those in the outer office, but he walked through them as though the place
were empty. Rumours sprang up behind him of which he was unconscious; the long-expected quarrel
had come; Austen had joined the motley ranks of the rebels under Mr. Crewe. Only the office
boy, Jimmy Towle, interrupted the jokes that were flying by repeating, with dogged vehemence,
"I tell you it ain't so. Austen kicked Ham downstairs. Ned Johnson saw him." Nor was it on
account of this particular deed that Austen was a hero in Jimmy's eyes.

Austen, finding himself in the square, looked at his watch. It was four o'clock. He made his
way under the maples to the house in Hanover Street, halted for a moment contemplatively before
the familiar classic pillars of its porch, took a key from his pocket, and (unprecedented action!)
entered by the front door. Climbing to the attic, he found two valises--one of which he had
brought back from Pepper County--and took them to his own room. They held, with a little crowding,
most of his possessions, including a photograph of Sarah Austen, which he left on the bureau
to the last. Once or twice he paused in his packing to gaze at the face, striving to fathom
the fleeting quality of her glance which the photograph had so strangely caught. In that glance
nature had stamped her enigma--for Sarah Austen was a child of nature. Hers was the gentle
look of wild things--but it was more; it was the understanding of--the unwritten law of creation,
the law by which the flowers grow, and wither; the law by which the animal springs upon its
prey, and, unerring, seeks its mate; the law of the song of the waters, and the song of the
morning stars; the law that permits evil and pain and dumb, incomprehensible suffering; the
law that floods at sunset the mountain lands with colour and the soul with light; and the law
that rends the branches in the blue storm. Of what avail was anger against it, or the puny
rage of man? Hilary Vane, not recognizing it, had spent his force upon it, like a hawk against
a mountain wall, but Austen looked at his mother's face and understood. In it was not the wisdom
of creeds and cities, but the unworldly wisdom which comprehends and condones.

His packing finished, with one last glance at the room Austen went downstairs with his valises
and laid them on the doorstep. Then he went to the stable and harnessed Pepper, putting into
the buggy his stable blanket and halter and currycomb, and, driving around to the front of
the house, hitched the horse at the stone post, and packed the valises in the back of the buggy.
After that he walked slowly to the back of the house and looked in at the kitchen window. Euphrasia,
her thin arms bare to the elbow, was bending over a wash-tub. He spoke her name, and as she
lifted her head a light came into her face which seemed to make her young again. She dried
her hands hastily on her apron as she drew towards him. He sprang through the window, and patted
her on the back--his usual salutation. And as she raised her eyes to his (those ordinarily
sharp eyes of Euphrasia's), they shone with an admiration she had accorded to no other human
being since he had come into the world. Terms of endearment she had, characteristically, never
used, she threw her soul into the sounding of his name.

"Off to the hills, Austen? I saw you a-harnessing of Pepper."

"Phrasie," he said, still patting her, "I'm going to the country for a while."

"To the country?" she repeated.

"To stay on a farm for a sort of vacation."

Her face brightened.

"Goin' to take a real vacation, be you?"

He laughed.

"Oh, I don't have to work very hard, Phrasie. You know I get out a good deal. I just thought--I
just thought I'd like to--sleep in the country --for a while."

"Well," answered Euphrasia, "I guess if you've took the notion, you've got to go. It was that
way with your mother before you. I've seen her leave the house on a bright Sabbath half an
hour before meetin' to be gone the whole day, and Hilary and all the ministers in town couldn't
stop her."

"I'll drop in once in a while to see you, Phrasie. I'll be at Jabe Jenney's."

"Jabe's is not more than three or four miles from Flint's place," Euphrasia remarked.

"I've thought of that," said Austen.

"You'd thought of it!"

Austen coloured.

"The distance is nothing," he said quickly, "with Pepper."

"And you'll come and see me?" asked Euphrasia.

"If you'll do something for me," he said.

"I always do what you want, Austen. You know I'm not able to refuse you."

He laid his hands on her shoulders.

"You'll promise?" he asked.

"I'll promise," said Euphrasia, solemnly.

He was silent for a moment, looking down at her.

"I want you to promise to stay here and take care of the Judge."

Fright crept into her eyes, but his own were smiling, reassuring.

"Take care of him!" she cried, the very mention of Hilary raising the pitch of her voice. "I
guess I'll have to. Haven't I took care of him nigh on forty years, and small thanks and recompense
I get for it except when you're here. I've wore out my life takin' care of him" (more gently).
"What do you mean by makin' me promise such a thing, Austen?"

"Well," said Austen, slowly, "the Judge is worried now. Things are not going as smoothly with
him as usual."

"Money?" demanded Euphrasia. "He ain't lost money, has he?"

A light began to dance in Austen's eyes in spite of the weight within him.

"Now, Phrasie," he said, lifting her chin a little, "you know you don't care any more about
money than I do."

"Lord help me," she exclaimed, "Lord help me if I didn't! And as long as you don't care for
it, and no sense can be knocked into your head about it, I hope you'll marry somebody that
does know the value of it. If Hilary was to lose what he has now, before it comes rightly to
you, he'd ought to be put in jail."

Austen laughed, and shook his head.

"Phrasie, the Lord did you a grave injustice when he didn't make you a man, but I suppose he'll
give you a recompense hereafter. No, I believe I am safe in saying that the Judge's securities
are still secure. Not that I really know--or care--" (shakes of the head from Euphrasia). "Poor
old Judge! Worse things than finance are troubling him now."

"Not a woman!" cried Euphrasia, horror-stricken at the very thought. "He hasn't took it into
his head after all these years--"

"No," said Austen, laughing, "no, no. It's not quite as bad as that, but it's pretty bad."

"In Heaven's name, what is it?" she demanded. "Reformers," said Austen.

"Reformers?" she repeated. "What might they be?"

"Well," answered Austen, "you might call them a new kind of caterpillar --only they feed on
corporations instead of trees."

Euphrasia shook her head vigorously.

"Go 'long," she exclaimed. "When you talk like that I never can follow you, Austen. If Hilary
has any worries, I guess he brought 'em on himself. I never knew him to fail."

"Ambitious and designing persons are making trouble for his railroad."

"Well, I never took much stock in that railroad," said Euphrasia, with emphasis. "I never was
on it but an engine gave out, and the cars was jammed, and it wasn't less than an hour late.
And then they're eternally smashin' folks or runnin' 'em down. You served 'em right when you
made 'em pay that Meader man six thousand dollars, and I told Hilary so." She paused, and stared
at Austen fixedly as a thought came into her head. "You ain't leavin' him because of this trouble,
are you, Austen?"

"Phrasie," he said, "I--I don't want to quarrel with him now. I think it would be easy to quarrel
with him."

"You mean him quarrel with you," returned Euphrasia. "I'd like to see him! If he did, it wouldn't
take me long to pack up and leave."

"That's just it. I don't want that to happen. And I've had a longing to go out and pay a little
visit to Jabe up in the hills, and drive his colts for him. You see," he said, "I've got a
kind of affection for the Judge."

Euphrasia looked at him, and her lips trembled.

"He don't deserve it," she declared, "but I suppose he's your father."

"He can't get out of that," said Austen.

"I'd like to see him try it," said Euphrasia. "Come in soon, Austen," she whispered, "come
in soon."

She stood on the lawn and watched him as he drove away, and he waved good-by to her over the
hood of the buggy. When he was out of sight she lifted her head, gave her eyes a vigorous brush
with her checked apron, and went back to her washing.

It was not until Euphrasia had supper on the table that Hilary Vane came home, and she glanced
at him sharply as he took his usual seat. It is a curious fact that it is possible for two
persons to live together for more than a third of a century, and at the end of that time understand
each other little better than at the beginning. The sole bond between Euphrasia and Hilary
was that of Sarah Austen and her son. Euphrasia never knew when Hilary was tired, or when he
was cold, or hungry, or cross, although she provided for all these emergencies. Her service
to him was unflagging, but he had never been under the slightest delusion that it was not an
inheritance from his wife. There must have been some affection between Mr. Vane and his housekeeper,
hidden away in the strong boxes of both but up to the present this was only a theory--not quite
as probable as that about the inhabitants of Mars.

He ate his supper to-night with his usual appetite, which had always been sparing; and he would
have eaten the same amount if the Northeastern Railroads had been going into the hands of a
receiver the next day. Often he did not exchange a word with Euphrasia between home-coming
and bed-going, and this was apparently to be one of these occasions. After supper he went,
as usual, to sit on the steps of his porch, and to cut his piece of Honey Dew, which never
varied a milligram. Nine o'clock struck, and Euphrasia, who had shut up the back of the house,
was on her way to bed with her lamp in her hand, when she came face to face with him in the
narrow passageway.

"Where's Austen?" he asked.

Euphrasia halted. The lamp shook, but she raised it to the level of his eyes.

"Don't you know?" she demanded.

"No," he said, with unparalleled humility.

She put down the lamp on the little table that stood beside her.

"He didn't tell you he was a-goin'?"

"No," said Hilary.

"Then how did you know he wasn't just buggy-ridin'?" she said.

Hilary Vane was mute.

"You've be'n to his room!" she exclaimed. "You've seen his things are gone!"

He confessed it by his silence. Then, with amazing swiftness and vigour for one of her age,
Euphrasia seized him by the arms and shook him.

"What have you done to him?" she cried; "what have you done to him? You sent him off. You've
never understood him--you've never behaved like a father to him. You ain't worthy to have him."
She flung herself away and stood facing Hilary at a little distance. What a fool I was! What
a fool! I might have known it, and I promised him."

"Promised him?" Hilary repeated. The shaking, the vehemence and anger, of Euphrasia seemed
to have had no effect whatever on the main trend of his thoughts.

"Where has he gone?"

"You can find out for yourself," she retorted bitterly. "I wish on your account it was to China.
He came here this afternoon, as gentle as ever, and packed up his things, and said he was goin'
away because you was worried. Worried!" she exclaimed scornfully. "His worry and his trouble
don't count--but yours. And he made me promise to stay with you. If it wasn't for him," she
cried, picking up the lamp, "I'd leave you this very night."

She swept past him, and up the narrow stairway to her bedroom.

CHAPTER XVII

BUSY DAYS AT WEDDERBURN

There is no blast so powerful, so withering, as the blast of ridicule. Only the strongest men
can withstand it, only reformers who are such in deed, and not alone in name, can snap their
fingers at it, and liken it to the crackling of thorns under a pot. Confucius and Martin Luther
must have been ridiculed, Mr. Crewe reflected, and although he did not have time to assure
himself on these historical points, the thought stayed him. Sixty odd weekly newspapers, filled
with arguments from the Book, attacked him all at once; and if by chance he should have missed
the best part of this flattering personal attention, the editorials which contained the most
spice were copied at the end of the week into the columns of his erstwhile friend, the State
Tribune, now the organ of that mysterious personality, the Honourable Adam B. Hunt. 'Et tu, Brute!'

Moreover, Mr. Peter Pardriff had something of his own to say. Some gentlemen of prominence
(not among the twenty signers of the new Declaration of Independence) had been interviewed
by the Tribune reporter on the subject of Mr. Crewe's candidacy. Here are some of the answers,
duly tabulated.

"Negligible."--Congressman Fairplay.

"One less vote for the Honourable Adam B. Hunt."--The Honourable Jacob Botcher.

"A monumental farce."--Ex-Governor Broadbent.

"Who is Mr. Crewe?"--Senator Whitredge. (Ah ha! Senator, this want shall be supplied, at least.)

"I have been very busy. I do not know what candidates are in the field."--Mr. Augustus P. Flint,
president of the Northeastern Railroads. (The unkindest cut of all!)

"I have heard that a Mr. Crewe is a candidate, but I do not know much about him. They tell
me he is a summer resident at Leith."--The Honourable Hilary Vane.

"A millionaire's freak--not to be taken seriously.--State Senator Nathaniel Billings."

The State Tribune itself seemed to be especially interested in the past careers of the twenty
signers. Who composed this dauntless band, whose members had arisen with remarkable unanimity
and martyr's zeal in such widely scattered parts of the State? Had each been simultaneously
inspired with the same high thought, and--more amazing still--with the idea of the same peerless
leader? The Tribune modestly ventured the theory that Mr. Crewe had appeared to each of the
twenty in a dream, with a flaming sword pointing to the steam of the dragon's breath. Or, perhaps,
a star had led each of the twenty to Leith. (This likening of Mr. H--n T--g to a star caused
much merriment among that gentleman's former friends and acquaintances.) The Tribune could
not account for this phenomenon by any natural laws, and was forced to believe that the thing
was a miracle--in which case it behooved the Northeastern Railroads to read the handwriting
on the wall. Unless--unless the twenty did not exist! Unless the whole thing were a joke! The
Tribune remembered a time when a signed statement, purporting to come from a certain Mrs. Amanda
P. Pillow, of 22 Blair Street, Newcastle, had appeared, to the effect that three bottles of
Rand's Peach Nectar had cured her of dropsy. On investigation there was no Blair Street, and
Mrs. Amanda P. Pillow was as yet unborn. The one sure thing about the statement was that Rand's
Peach Nectar could be had, in large or small quantities, as desired. And the Tribune was prepared
to state; on its own authority, that a Mr. Humphrey Crewe did exist, and might reluctantly
consent to take the nomination for the governorship. In industry and zeal he was said to resemble
the celebrated and lamented Mr. Rand, of the Peach Nectar.

Ingratitude merely injures those who are capable of it, although it sometimes produces sadness
in great souls. What were Mr. Crewe's feelings when he read this drivel? When he perused the
extracts from the "Book of Arguments" which appeared (with astonishing unanimity, too!) in
sixty odd weekly newspapers of the State--an assortment of arguments for each county.

"Brush Bascom's doin' that work now," said Mr. Tooting, contemptuously, "and he's doin' it
with a shovel. Look here! He's got the same squib in three towns within a dozen miles of each
other, the one beginning 'Political conditions in this State are as clean as those of any State
in the Union, and the United Northeastern Railroads is a corporation which is, fortunately,
above calumny. A summer resident who, to satisfy his lust for office, is rolling to defame--'"

"Yes," interrupted Mr. Crewe, "never mind reading any more of that rot."

"It's botched," said Mr. Tooting, whose artistic soul was jarred. "I'd have put that in Avalon
County, and Weave, and Marshall. I know men that take all three of those papers in Putnam."

No need of balloonists to see what the enemy is about, when we have a Mr. Tooting.

"They're stung!" he cried, as he ran rapidly through the bundle of papers--Mr. Crewe having
subscribed, with characteristic generosity, to the entire press of the State. "Flint gave 'em
out all this stuff about the railroad bein' a sacred institution. You've got 'em on the run
right now, Mr. Crewe. You'll notice that, Democrats and Republicans, they've dropped everybody
else, that they've all been sicked on to you. They're scared."

"I came to that conclusion some time ago," replied Mr. Crewe, who was sorting over his letters.

"And look there!" exclaimed Mr. Tooting, tearing out a paragraph, "there's the best campaign
material we've had yet. Say, I'll bet Flint taken that doddering idiot's pass away for writing
that."

Mr. Crewe took the extract, and read:--

     "A summer resident of Leith, who is said to be a millionaire
     many times over, and who had a somewhat farcical career as a
     legislator last winter, has announced himself as a candidate
     for the Republican nomination on a platform attacking the
     Northeastern Railroads. Mr. Humphrey Crewe declares that the
     Northeastern Railroads govern us. What if they do? Every
     sober-minded citizen, will agree that they give us a pretty
     good government. More power to them."

Mr. Crewe permitted himself to smile.

"They are playing into our hands, sure enough. What?"

This is an example of the spirit in which the ridicule and abuse was met.

It was Senator Whitredge--only, last autumn so pleased to meet Mr. Crewe at Mr. Flint's--who
asked the hypocritical question, "Who is Humphrey Crewe?" A biography (in pamphlet form, illustrated,--send
your name and address) is being prepared by the invaluable Mr. Tooting, who only sleeps six
hours these days. We shall see it presently, when it emerges from that busy hive at Wedderburn.

Wedderburn was a hive, sure enough. Not having a balloon ourselves, it is difficult to see
all that is going on there; but there can be no mistake (except by the Honourable Hilary's
seismograph) that it has become the centre of extraordinary activity. The outside world has
paused to draw breath at the spectacle, and members of the metropolitan press are filling the
rooms of the Ripton House and adding to the prosperity of its livery-stable. Mr. Crewe is a
difficult man to see these days--there are so many visitors at Wedderburn, and the representatives
of the metropolitan press hitch their horses and stroll around the grounds, or sit on the porch
and converse with gentlemen from various counties of the State who (as the Tribune would put
it) have been led by a star to Leith.

On the occasion of one of these gatherings, when Mr. Crewe had been inaccessible for four hours,
Mrs. Pomfret drove up in a victoria with her daughter Alice.

"I'm sure I don't know when we're going to see poor dear Humphrey again," said Mrs. Pomfret,
examining the group on the porch through her gold-mounted lenses; these awful people are always
here when I come. I wonder if they sleep here, in the hammocks and lounging chairs! Alice,
we must be very polite to them--so much depends on it."

"I'm always polite, mother," answered Alice, "except when you tell me not to be. The trouble
is I never know myself."

The victoria stopped in front of the door, and the irreproachable Waters advanced across the porch.

"Waters," said Mrs. Pomfret, "I suppose Mr. Crewe is too busy to come out."

"I'm afraid so, madam," replied Waters; "there's a line of gentlemen waitin' here" (he eyed
them with no uncertain disapproval). and I've positive orders not to disturb him, madam."

"I quite understand, at a time like this," said Mrs. Pomfret, and added, for the benefit of
her audience, "when Mr. Crewe has been public-spirited and unselfish enough to undertake such
a gigantic task. Tell him Miss Pomfret and I call from time to time because we are so interested,
and that the whole of Leith wishes him success."

"I'll tell him, madam," said Waters,

But Mrs. Pomfret did not give the signal for her coachman to drive on. She looked, instead,
at the patient gathering.

"Good morning, gentlemen," she said.

"Mother!" whispered Alice, "what are you going to do?"

The gentlemen rose.

"I'm Mrs. Pomfret," she said, as though that simple announcement were quite sufficient,--as
it was, for the metropolitan press. Not a man of them who had not seen Mrs. Pomfret's important
movements on both sides of the water chronicled. "I take the liberty of speaking to you, as
we all seem to be united in a common cause. How is the campaign looking?"

Some of the gentlemen shifted their cigars from one hand to the other, and grinned sheepishly.

"I am so interested," continued Mrs. Pomfret; "it is so unusual in America for a gentleman
to be willing to undertake such a thing, to subject himself to low criticism, and to have his
pure motives questioned. Mr. Crewe has rare courage--I have always said so. And we are all
going to put our shoulder to the wheel, and help him all we can."

There was one clever man there who was quick to see his opportunity, and seize it for his newspaper.

"And are you going to help Mr. Crewe in his campaign, Mrs. Pomfret?"

"Most assuredly," answered Mrs. Pomfret. "Women in this country could do so much if they only
would. You know," she added, in her most winning manner, "you know that a woman can often get
a vote when a man can't."

"And you, and--other ladies will go around to the public meetings?"

"Why not, my friend; if Mr. Crewe has no objection? and I can conceive of none."

"You would have an organization of society ladies to help Mr. Crewe?"

"That's rather a crude way of putting it," answered Mrs. Pomfret, with her glasses raised judicially.
"Women in what you call I society are, I am glad to say, taking an increasing interest in politics.
They are beginning to realize that it is a duty."

"Thank you," said the reporter; "and now would you mind if I took a photograph of you in your
carriage."

"Oh, mother," protested Alice, "you won't let him do that!"

"Be quiet, Alice. Lady Aylestone and the duchess are photographed in every conceivable pose
for political purposes. Wymans, just drive around to the other side of the circle."

The article appeared next day, and gave, as may be imagined, a tremendous impetus to Mr. Crewe's
cause. "A new era in American politics!" "Society to take a hand in the gubernatorial campaign
of Millionaire Humphrey Crewe!" "Noted social leader, Mrs. Patterson Pomfret, declares it a
duty, and saga that English women have the right idea." And a photograph of Mrs. Patterson
Pomfret herself, in her victoria, occupied a generous portion of the front page.

"What's all this rubbish about Mrs. Pomfret?" was Mr. Crewe's grateful comment when he saw
it. "I spent two valuable hours with that reporter givin' him material and statistics, and
I can't find that he's used a word of it."

"Never you mind about that," Mr. Tooting replied. "The more advertising you get, the better,
and this shows that the right people are behind you. Mrs. Pomfret's a smart woman, all right.
She knows her job. And here's more advertising," he continued, shoving another sheet across
the desk, "a fine likeness of you in caricature labelled, 'Ajax defying the Lightning.' Who's
Ajax? There was an Italian, a street contractor, with that name--or something like it--in Newcastle
a couple of years ago--in the eighth ward."

In these days, when false rumours fly apace to the injury of innocent men, it is well to get
at the truth, if possible. It is not true that Mr. Paul Pardriff, of the 'Ripton Record,' has
been to Wedderburn. Mr. Pardriff was getting into a buggy to go--somewhere--when he chanced
to meet the Honourable Brush Bascom, and the buggy was sent back to the livery-stable. Mr.
Tooting had been to see Mr. Pardriff before the world-quaking announcement of June 7th, and
had found Mr. Pardriff a reformer who did not believe that the railroad should run the State.
But the editor of the Ripton Record was a man after Emerson's own heart: "a foolish consistency
is the hobgoblin of little minds"--and Mr. Pardriff did not go to Wedderburn. He went off on
an excursion up the State instead, for he had been working too hard; and he returned, as many
men do from their travels, a conservative. He listened coldly to Mr. Tooting's impassioned
pleas for cleaner politics, until Mr. Tooting revealed the fact that his pockets were full
of copy. It seems that a biography was to be printed--a biography which would, undoubtedly,
be in great demand; the biography of a public benefactor, illustrated with original photographs
and views in the country. Mr. Tooting and Mr. Pardriff both being men of the world, some exceeding
plain talk ensued between them, and when two such minds unite, a way out is sure to be found.
One can be both a conservative and a radical--if one is clever. There were other columns in
Mr. Pardriff's paper besides editorial columns; editorial columns, Mr. Pardriff said, were
sacred to his convictions. Certain thumb-worn schedules were referred to. Paul Pardriff, Ripton,
agreed to be the publisher of the biography.

The next edition of the Record was an example of what Mr. Emerson meant. Three columns contained
extracts of absorbing interest from the forthcoming biography and, on another page, an editorial.
The Honourable Humphrey Crewe, of Leith, is an estimable gentleman and a good citizen, whose
public endeavours have been of great benefit to the community. A citizen of Avalon County,
the Record regrets that it cannot support his candidacy for the Republican gubernatorial nomination.
We are not among those who seek to impugn motives, and while giving Mr. Crewe every credit
that his charges against the Northeastern Railroads are made in good faith, we beg to differ
from him. That corporation is an institution which has stood the test of time, and enriches
every year the State treasury by a large sum in taxes. Its management is in safe, conservative
hands. No one will deny Mr. Crewe's zeal for the State's welfare, but it must be borne in mind
that he is a newcomer in politics, and that conditions, seen from the surface, are sometimes
deceptive. We predict for Mr. Crewe a long and useful career, but we do not think that at this
time, and on this platform, he will obtain the governorship."

"Moral courage is what the age needs," had been Mr. Crewe's true and sententious remark when
he read this editorial. But, bearing in mind a biblical adage, he did not blame Mr. Tooting
for his diplomacy. "Send in the next man."

Mr. Tooting opened the study door and glanced over the public-spirited citizens awaiting, on
the porch, the pleasure of their leader.

"Come along, Caldwell," said Mr. Tooting. "He wants your report from Kingston. Get a hustle on!"

Mr. Caldwell made his report, received many brief and business-like suggestions, and retired,
impressed. Whereupon Mr. Crewe commanded Mr. Tooting to order his automobile--an occasional
and rapid spin over the country roads being the only diversion the candidate permitted himself.
Wishing to be alone with his thoughts, he did not take Mr. Tooting with him on these excursions.

"And by the way," said Mr. Crewe, as he seized the steering wheel a few moments later, "just
drop a line to Austen Vane, will you, and tell him I want to see him up here within a day or
two. Make an appointment. It has occurred to me that he might be very useful."

Mr. Tooting stood on the driveway watching the cloud of dust settle on the road below. Then
he indulged in a long and peculiarly significant whistle through his teeth, rolled his eyes
heavenward, and went into the house. He remembered Austen's remark about riding a cyclone.

Mr. Crewe took the Tunbridge road. On his excursion of the day before he had met Mrs. Pomfret,
who had held up her hand, and he had protestingly brought the car to a stop.

"Your horses don't frighten," he had said.

"No, but I wanted to speak to you, Humphrey," Mrs. Pomfret had replied; "you are becoming so
important that nobody ever has a glimpse of you. I wanted to tell you what an interest we take
in this splendid thing you are doing."

"Well," said Mr. Crewe, "it was a plain duty, and nobody else seemed willing to undertake it."

Mrs. Pomfret's eyes had flashed.

"Men of that type are scarce," she answered. "But you'll win. You're the kind of man that wins."

"Oh, yes, I'll win," said Mr. Crewe.

"You're so magnificently sure of yourself," cried Mrs. Pomfret. "Alice is taking such an interest.
Every day she asks, 'When is Humphrey going to make his first speech?' You'll let us know in
time, won't you?"

"Did you put all that nonsense in the New York Flare?" asked Mr. Crewe.

"Oh, Humphrey, I hope you liked it," cried Mrs. Pomfret. "Don't make the mistake of despising
what women can do. They elected the Honourable Billy Aylestone--he said so himself. I'm getting
all the women interested."

"Who've you been calling on now?" he inquired.

Mrs. Pomfret hesitated.

"I've been up at Fairview to see about Mrs. Flint. She isn't much better."

"Is Victoria home?" Mr. Crewe demanded, with undisguised interest.

"Poor dear girl!" said Mrs. Pomfret, "of course I wouldn't have mentioned the subject to her,
but she wanted to know all about it. It naturally makes an awkward situation between you and
her, doesn't it?"

"Oh, Victoria's level-headed enough," Mr. Crewe had answered; "I guess she knows something
about old Flint and his methods by this time. At any rate, it won't make any difference with
me," he added magnanimously, and threw in his clutch. He had encircled Fairview in his drive
that day, and was, curiously enough, headed in that direction now. When his will was opened, it
was by the side of Sarah he wished to be buried:" As to my Body,
I desire it may be interred under the Tombstone in the enclosed ground
in the Presbyterian Yard near where my first wife and children are
interred."[ 76] This house was the social and political center of
Alexandria.

Such men as Charles Carroll, Aaron Burr, John Paul
Jones, John Marshall, Thomas Jefferson, George Mason, George Washington,
and the two Fairfaxes are but a few of those who gathered here for
good food, good wine, and better talk.

Any visitor of importance was entertained at" coffee"; the house was often
filled with music, and" balls" were common. The" Congress of Alexandria"
met here Monday, April 14, 1755, and on the following Tuesday and
Wednesday, when with Braddock and the five colonial governors plans
were made for concerted action against the French and Indians.

Here
that famous letter, still in existence, was written, urging upon the British government the necessity
of taxing the colonies.

This letter set into movement a chain of events disastrous to the mother country. It resulted in the loathed
Stamp Act and led ultimately to the Revolution of 1775. Carlyle was
appointed collector of His Majesty' s customs on the South Potomac
in 1758, succeeding his father- in- law, William Fairfax.

In 1762 he was importing race equine into the colony. These were imported," just as they imported Madeira
wine and other luxuries." One of the early Maryland gazettes of
July 29, 1762 carries the following advertisement: Imported by Carlyle&
Dalton in the ship Christian, Captain Stanly, and for sale, three
horses[ Thorne' s Starling: Smith' s Hero, and Leary' s Old England]
and three mares[ the other two being the Rock- mares Nos.

1 and 2] of full blood, viz: A ch. m. with a star and two white heels behind,
eight years old: Got by Wilson' s Chestnut Arabian: her dam JOHN
CARLYLE[ 77] Alexandria, and back, laying out and planting his garden,
taking part in long, hot arguments with his family and neighbors in
the ever- widening breach between the colonies and the mother country,
breeding race horses, and joining in the frolics of the Jockey Club.

Heir to a title old and as it was, he ardently espoused the cause of
the colonies.

Too ill for active military service, he nevertheless served as a member of the Committee of Safety
until his death in 1780, at the age of sixty. John Carlyle divided his
lands, named after the Scottish family holdings, Limkiln, Bridekirk,
Torthorwald Taken, between his two grandsons, Carlyle Fairfax Whiting
and John Carlyle Herbert.

To his daughter,
Sarah Herbert, he left thirty feet on Fairfax Street and one hundred
feet on Cameron Street, to include his dryware house. The mansion and all
other property were for a brief period the property of his only son.

In his will he expressed the utmost concern for the education of this
boy, George William Carlyle, and urged his executors to spare no expense
and to send him to the best schools. Alas, for the plans of men! The
lad, fired by the talk of father and friends, was serving in Lee'
s Legion in 1781, and ere John Carlyle was moldering in his grave
this boy of seventeen years, spirited, brave, heir to large estates,
great fortune and honorable name, and to the title of Lord Carlyle,
was dead at Eutaw Springs, led by that boy hardly older than himself"

Light
Horse Harry" Lee. Enough of serious and sad history; let us in lighter vein
go once more into the lovely paneled blue room where not only weighty
conferences occurred, but where, in lace and satin, noble figures
threw aside the cares of state and trod a measure to the tinkling
of the spinet; where games of cards were indulged in and the pistoles
changed hands.

Let us go into the dining room with its fine Adam mantel and its
mahogany doors, and visualize again the terrapin and the canvasback,
the Madeira and Port so abundantly provided from that great kitchen
below, and the most famous wine cellar of its day in Alexandria.

Let us stroll in the still lovely garden where the aroma of box and
honeysuckle mingle, and turn our thoughts once more to the inmates
of this fine, old house.

Built in the days when Virginia was a man' s world, when men who
wore satin, velvet and damask were masters of the art of fighting,
riding, drinking, eating, and wooing.

When a man knew what he wanted, and got it by God' s help and his own
tenacity, enjoying himself right lustily in the getting.

Perchance Major John Carlyle, clad in Saxon green laced with silver,
will be wandering up and down his box- bordered paths with his first
love, Sarah Fairfax, watching the moon light up the rigging of Carlyle&
Dalton' s great ships at anchor just at the foot of the garden.

Chapter 3 The Married Houses[ 209- 211 North Fairfax Street.

Owner: Mrs. Herbert E. Marshburn.] When the new town of Alexandria was
laid out, John Dalton purchased, on July 13, 1749, the first lot put up
for sale( No. 36) for the sum of nineteen pistoles. The lot faced the
Potomac River and was bounded by Water( now Lee) Street, Fairfax Street
and lot No. 37. When the latter lot, which lay on Cameron and Fairfax,
was put up later in the day, it was purchased by Dalton for sixteen
pistoles.

Within three years Dalton had finished a small frame- and- brick cottage,
neatly paneled, in which he is purported to have lived and died.

The house faced on Cameron Street, standing about the middle of lot No. 37, with an extensive
garden running the depth of the premises to the river, surrounded
by outbuildings, orchards, wells, and so on, as was the custom of
the times.

His will mentioned the fact that he lived on this lot and left to his daughter, Jenny Dalton( later Mrs.
Thomas Herbert), new brick building on the corner of Fairfax and Cameron.
His will further stated that the house must be finished out of his estate.
To his daughter, Catherine( later Mrs. William Bird), he left the remainder
of the lot which included his dwelling and another house on that
same lot, at the time occupied by John Page.

On February 27, 1750, John Dalton succeeded Richard Osborn as a trustee
of the town.

His appointment was the first after the original selection of trustees
by the assembly in Williamsburg. John Dalton was a partner of John Carlyle
in the firm of Carlyle& Dalton, which for many years acted as agent
for the Mount Vernon him produce.

He was a pew owner with George Washington at Christ Church, which he served as vestryman. With
his wife and daughter, he was a frequent visitor at Mount Vernon and a later chronicler has asserted
that he barely missed becoming the General' s father- in- law. A fox-
hunter and horse- lover, in a company of Alexandria gentlemen or alone,
he hunted with Washington and bred his mares to the blooded Mount
Vernon stud.

On January 12, 1769, Washington went up to Alexandria to" ye Monthly
Ball."

He lodged with Captain Dalton and the next day being very bad he
was" confined there till afternoon by rain."[ 78] Sometimes when attending
court he" lodged at Captn. Dalton' s."[ 79] John Dalton' s bequest
to his daughter, Catherine, included the home place. On April 24, 1793,
Catherine and her husband, William Bird, sold to Jonah Thompson and
David Findley for£ 1,500( about$ 7,500) the property described as
being in Fairfax Street, 60 feet to the north of Cameron, and extending
north upon Fairfax Street 119 feet 3 inches to the line of Herbert,
Potts and Wilson, thence East parallel to to cross Water and Union
Streets into the Potomac River, thence with a line parallel to Fairfax
south 119 feet 3 inches, and included houses, buildings, streets,
lanes, alleys, and so on.

But the Birds reserved the right to the" use and occupation of the dwelling House now occupied" and
the kitchen and garden, until the" 1st day of October next" and also reserved unto Lanty Crowe
the house" demised unto him to the end of his term, he paying the annual rent thereof unto the
said Jonah Thompson and David Findley."[ 80] Findley died within the
year and Jonah Thompson bought from Amelia Findley, the mother and
heir of David Findley, equal and undivided portion of the already
described lot and paid Va., July 1762.

In 1772 Carlyle took over the incompleted work on Christ Church
and carried it to completion. In 1773 he bought pew No. 19. In 1774
he built the Presbyterian meetinghouse.

In between times he was hunting at Belvoir and Mount Vernon, dancing
at Alexandria assemblies, sitting as town trustee and gentleman justice,
journeying to England her the sum of£ 500 12s. Jonah another daughter,
Eugenia, married a Mr. mount. In 1809 Jonah Thompson mortgaged this property
to the Bank of Alexandria for$ 13,500, which he paid within four years.
In May 1850, the heirs of Jonah Thompson sold to Benjamin Hallowell
for$ 4,600 a lot beginning at the south side of the alley which divided
the block, running south 43 Thompson was an important citizen of Alexandria.

He was a shipping merchant, banker and large property owner.

He married Margaret Peyton and they had three sons, Israel, William
Edward, and James; a daughter, Mary Ann, married a Mr. Popham, and
feet 7 inches.

Benjamin Hallowell, in turn, sold to James S. Hallowell for nine
thousand dollars in April 1854, and from James S. Hallowell and wife
the property passed through various hands until it became St. Mary'
s Academy.

The Jonah Thompson house, part of it at least already built in 1793,
is one of the most interesting houses to be found anywhere.

It is unusually large and has two handsome arched stone entrances. One,
although similar, obviously was added, as the line of demarcation is
plainly visible between the bricks.

The house has been sadly abused with no thought given its architectural merits and much of the woodwork
has been removed.

The stair is perhaps the finest in Alexandria, with spindles and risers carved in a more elaborate fashion
than was the practice of the thrifty Scotsmen of Alexandria.

At the rear of this large house, separated only by a narrow area, stands
another house, facing the long garden and originally the river.

The front of this house boasts the loveliest bit of Georgian architecture left in the old seaport. A pure Adam
loggia, executed in stone, runs across the garden façade. While arches
are now filled in and clothes hung to dry flap on the gallery, the
outline is so chaste in its classic form that nothing can destroy
the illusion of beauty.

No search of records reveals how or why these two houses stand back to back. Whether Jonah Thompson
built the first for his bank or business offices, or whether his family outgrew the house and he needed
more room is not known.

The two are treated as one house in all the documentary evidence,
and one' s curiosity, interest, and imagination he are excited by
the twin or married houses.

One story has it that Jonah Thompson built the rear or twin house for his eldest son so that the two
families might be together but with separate ménages.

Captain John Dalton forged a link between Mount Vernon, his family, and his posterity that was
stronger than he knew. It was his granddaughter who was so deeply distressed at the ruin
and desolation of the home of Washington that she fired her daughter'
s imagination with an idea that saved the spot for the nation.

This great- granddaughter of John Dalton was Ann Pamela Cunningham, whose name will ever be indissolubly
connected with Mount Vernon.

In 1853 she formed the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, and as its first regent stirred the women of
America with her ardor and directed the entire campaign until adequate
funds were collected.

In 1859 John Augustine Washington sold the Mount Vernon estate to Miss
Cunningham for two hundred thousand dollars-- after the Virginia
Legislature and the federal government had both refused to acquire it.

This sale was negotiated by the Alexandria banker, John W. Burke,
who was appointed executor and guardian of John Augustine Washington' s estate
after he was killed during the Civil War while on active duty as
a member of General Robert E. Lee' s staff.

When the war broke out, Alexandria was occupied by Union troops.

The Union authorities knew of the sale of Mount Vernon and repeated but futile efforts by Slipby,
brother to Snap' s dam; and out of Menil[ sic] the dam of Trunnion. Menil was got by Partner: out of
Sampson' s- Sister, which was got by Greyhound: her grandam by Curwen'
s Bay Barb: her g. grandam by Ld. D' Arcy' s Arabian: her dam by Whiteshirt:
out of a famous mare of Ld. Montagu' s. were made to find the securities.
Mr. Burke' s home was searched no less than three times. The funds were
never found in their hiding place of the soiled- clothes basket. There
they reposed until Mrs. Burke( née Trist, great- granddaughter of
Thomas Jefferson) and Mrs. Upton Herbert( née Tracy), both Philadelphia-
born ladies, sewed the bonds in their petticoats and with high heads
carried them through the Union lines to Washington and delivered them
to George W. Riggs, who held them for the duration of the war, when
he returned them to Alexandria-- and Mr. Burke.

An interesting sequel to the story occurred only a short time ago when the last of John Augustine Washington'
s children died. Mr. Taylor Burke, grandson of John W. Burke, and president of the Burke& Herbert
Bank, administered the estate of the late Mrs. Eleanor Washington Howard, and distributed her estate, composed
of the remainder of that purchase price, among her heirs.[ 81] Chapter
4 The Fairfaxes of Belvoir and Alexandria Of the families in Virginia
closely associated with George Washington, none bore so intimate a
relation as that of Fairfax.

William Fairfax, founder of the Virginia branch of the family, was born in 1691 in Towlston in Yorkshire,
England, the son of the Honorable Henry Fairfax, Sheriff of Yorkshire,
and grandson of the Fourth Lord Fairfax. Educated as a member of
the governing classes, he began his career in the navy, later entering
the colonial service.

Before he was twenty- six he had acted as chief justice of the Bahamas and Governor of the Isle of
Providence.

Prior to 1717 he married Sarah Walker of Nassau, daughter of Colonel
Walker, by whom he had four children, George William, Thomas, Anne, and
Sarah. In 1729, Colonel Fairfax was appointed Collector of the Port
of Salem, Massachusetts, and removed to that colony. In 1731 his wife
died, and very shortly afterward he married Deborah, widow of Francis
Clarke and daughter of Colonel Bartholomew Gedney of Salem, by whom
he had three children, Bryan, William Henry, and Hannah.

In 1734 Fairfax came to Virginia as agent for his first cousin, Thomas,
Sixth Lord Fairfax( who, by direct inheritance from a royal grant of Charles
II, had come into possession of some five million acres of Virginia
land lying between the Rappahannock and the Potomac, and extending
from Chesapeake Bay to the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains,
known to Virginians as the Northern Neck); and to serve as Collector
of Customs for the South Potomac.

Fairfax first went to Westmoreland, where he was associated with the Washington
and Lee families. Next he moved to King George, and lived at Falmouth. By
1741 he was representing Prince William County in the House of Burgesses.
Colonel Fairfax was elevated to" His Majesty' s Council of State"
three years later.

Becoming President of the Council in 1744, he continued in that office until his death. About
this time William Fairfax completed his dwelling house, Belvoir, situated on a high bluff overlooking
the Potomac River, halfway between Mount Vernon and Gunston Hall. It
was described by Washington in an advertisement as having" four convenient
rooms and a wide Hall on the first floor." In one of these" convenient
rooms," more than two hundred years ago on July 19, 1743, Anne, eldest
daughter of Colonel Fairfax was married to Lawrence Washington of
Mount Vernon.



"Why did he leave his father?" asked Victoria, not taking the trouble now to conceal her interest.

"Well," said Tom, "you know they never did get along. It hasn't been Austen's fault--he's tried.
After he came back from the West he stayed here to please old Hilary, when he might have gone
to New York and made a fortune at the law, with his brains. But after Austen saw the kind of
law the old man practised he wouldn't stand for it, and got an office of his own."

Victoria's eyes grew serious.

"What kind of law does Hilary Vane practise?" she asked.

Tom hesitated and began to mop his forehead again.

"Please don't mind me," Victoria pleaded.

"Well, all right," said Tom, "I'll tell you the truth, or die for it. But I don't want to make
you-unhappy."

"You will do me a kindness, Mr. Gaylord," she said, "by telling me what you believe to be true."

There was a note in her voice which young Tom did not understand. Afterwards, when he reflected
about the matter, he wondered if she were unhappy.

"I don't want to blame Hilary too much," he answered. "I know Austen don't. Hilary's grown
up with that way of doing things, and in the old days there was no other way. Hilary is the
chief counsel for the Northeastern, and he runs the Republican organization in this State for
their benefit. But Austen made up his mind that there was no reason why he should grow up that
way. He says that a lawyer should keep to his profession, and not become a lobbyist in the
interest of his clients. He lived with the old man until the other day, because he has a real
soft spot for him. Austen put up with a good deal. And then Hilary turned loose on him and
said a lot of things he couldn't stand. Austen didn't answer, but went up and packed his bags
and made Hilary's housekeeper promise to stay with him, or she'd have left, too. They say Hilary's
sorry, now. He's fond of Austen, but he can't get along with him."

"Do--Do you know what they quarreled about?" asked Victoria, in a low voice.

"This spring," said Tom, "the Gaylord Lumber Company made Austen junior counsel. He ran across
a law the other day that nobody else seems to have had sense enough to discover, by which we
can sue the railroad for excessive freight rates. It means a lot of money. He went right in
to Hilary and showed him the section, told him that suit was going to be brought, and offered
to resign. Hilary flew off the track--and said if he didn't bring suit he'd publish it all
over the State that Austen started it. Galusha Hammer, our senior counsel, is sick, and I don't
think he'll ever get well. That makes Austen senior counsel. But he persuaded old Tom, my father,
not to bring this suit until after the political campaign, until Mr. Crewe gets through with
his fireworks. Hilary doesn't know that."

"I see," said Victoria.

Down the hill, on the far side of the track, she perceived the two men approaching with a horse;
then she remembered the fact that she had been thrown, and that it was her horse. She rose
to her feet.

"I'm ever so much obliged to you, Mr. Gaylord," she said; "you have done me a great favour
by--telling me these things. And thanks for letting them catch the horse. I'm afraid I've put
you to a lot of bother."

"Not at all," said Tom, "not at all." He was studying her face. Its expression troubled and
moved him strangely, for he was not an analytical person. "I didn't mean to tell you those
things when I began," he apologized, "but you wanted to hear them."

"I wanted to hear them," repeated Victoria. She held out her hand to him.

"You're not going to ride home!" he exclaimed. "I'll take you up in my buggy--it's in the station
shed."

She smiled, turned and questioned and thanked the men, examined the girths and bridle, and
stroked the five-year-old on the neck. He was wet from mane to fetlocks.

"I don't think he'll care to run much farther," she said. "If you'll pull him over to the lumber
pile, Mr. Gaylord, I'll mount him."

They performed her bidding in silence, each paying her a tribute in his thoughts. As for the
five-year-old, he was quiet enough by this time. When she was in the saddle she held out her
hand once more to Tom.

"I hope we shall meet soon again," she said, and smiling back at him, started on her way towards
Fairview.

Tom stood for a moment looking after her, while the two men indulged in surprised comments.

"Andrews," said young Mr. Gaylord, "just fetch my buggy and follow her until she gets into
the gate."

CHAPTER XVIII

A SPIRIT IN THE WOODS

Empires crack before they crumble, and the first cracks seem easily mended--even as they have
been mended before. A revolt in Gaul or Britain or Thrace is little to be minded, and a prophet
in Judea less. And yet into him who sits in the seat of power a premonition of something impending
gradually creeps--a premonition which he will not acknowledge, will not define. Yesterday,
by the pointing of a finger, he created a province; to-day he dares not, but consoles himself
by saying he does not wish to point. No antagonist worthy of his steel has openly defied him,
worthy of recognition by the opposition of a legion. But the sense of security has been subtly
and indefinably shaken.

By the strange telepathy which defies language, to the Honourable Hilary Vane, Governor of
the Province, some such unacknowledged forebodings have likewise been communicated. A week
after his conversation with Austen, on the return of his emperor from a trip to New York, the
Honourable Hilary was summoned again to the foot of the throne, and his thoughts as he climbed
the ridges towards Fairview were not in harmony with the carols of the birds in the depths
of the forest and the joy of the bright June weather. Loneliness he had felt before, and to
its ills he had applied the antidote of labour. The burden that sat upon his spirit to-day
was not mere loneliness; to the truth of this his soul attested, but Hilary Vane had never
listened to the promptings of his soul. He would have been shocked if you had told him this.
Did he not confess, with his eyes shut, his sins every Sunday? Did he not publicly acknowledge
his soul?

Austen Vane had once remarked that, if some keen American lawyer would really put his mind
to the evasion of the Ten Commandments, the High Heavens themselves might be cheated. This
saying would have shocked the Honourable Hilary inexpressibly. He had never been employed by
a syndicate to draw up papers to avoid these mandates; he revered them, as he revered the Law,
which he spelled with a capital. He spelled the word Soul with a capital likewise, and certainly
no higher recognition could be desired than this! Never in the Honourable Hilary's long, laborious,
and preeminently model existence had he realized that happiness is harmony. It would not be
true to assert that, on this wonderful June day, a glimmering of this truth dawned upon him.
Such a statement would be open to the charge of exaggeration, and his frame of mind was pessimistic.
But he had got so far as to ask himself the question,--Cui bono? and repeated it several times
on his drive, until a verse of Scripture came, unbidden, to his lips. "For what hate man of
all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?"
and "there is one event unto all." Austen's saying, that he had never learned how to enjoy
life, he remembered, too. What had Austen meant by that?

Hitherto Hilary Vane had never failed of self-justification in any event which had befallen
him; and while this consciousness of the rectitude of his own attitude had not made him happier,
there had been a certain grim pleasure in it. To the fact that he had ruined, by sheer over-righteousness,
the last years of the sunny life of Sarah Austen he had been oblivious--until to-day. The strange,
retrospective mood which had come over him this afternoon led his thoughts into strange paths,
and he found himself wondering if, after all, it had not been in his power to make her happier.
Her dryad-like face, with its sweet, elusive smile, seemed to peer at him now wistfully out
of the forest, and suddenly a new and startling thought rose up within him--after six and thirty
years. Perhaps she had belonged in the forest! Perhaps, because he had sought to cage her,
she had pined and died! The thought gave Hilary unwonted pain, and he strove to put it away
from him; but memories such as these, once aroused, are not easily set at rest, and he bent
his head as he recalled (with a new and significant pathos) those hopeless and pitiful flights
into the wilds she loved.

Now Austen had gone. Was there a Law behind these actions of mother and son which he had persisted
in denouncing as vagaries? Austen was a man: a man, Hilary could not but see, who had the respect
of his fellows, whose judgment and talents were becoming recognized. Was it possible that he,
Hilary Vane, could have been one of those referred to by the Preacher? During the week which
had passed since Austen's departure the house in Hanover Street had been haunted for Hilary.
The going of his son had not left a mere void,--that would have been pain enough. Ghosts were
there, ghosts which he could but dimly feel and see, and more than once, in the long evenings,
he had taken to the streets to avoid them.

In that week Hilary's fear of meeting his son in the street or in the passages of the building
had been equalled by a yearning to see him. Every morning, at the hour Austen was wont to drive
Pepper to the Ripton House stables across the square, Hilary had contrived to be standing near
his windows--a little back, and out of sight. And--stranger still!--he had turned from these
glimpses to the reports of the Honourable Brush Bascom and his associates with a distaste he
had never felt before.

With some such thoughts as these Hilary Vane turned into the last straight stretch of the avenue
that led to Fairview House, with its red and white awnings gleaming in the morning sun. On
the lawn, against a white and purple mass of lilacs and the darker background of pines, a straight
and infinitely graceful figure in white caught his eye and held it. He recognized Victoria.
She wore a simple summer gown, the soft outline of its flounces mingling subtly with the white
clusters behind her. She turned her head at the sound of the wheels and looked at him; the
distance was not too great for a bow, but Hilary did not bow. Something in her face deterred
him from this act,--something which he himself did not understand or define. He sought to pronounce
the incident negligible. What was the girl, or her look, to him? And yet (he found himself
strangely thinking) he had read in her eyes a trace of the riddle which had been relentlessly
pursuing him; there was an odd relation in her look to that of Sarah Austen. During the long
years he had been coming to Fairview, even before the new house was built, when Victoria was
in pinafores, he had never understood her. When she was a child, he had vaguely recognized
in her a spirit antagonistic to his own, and her sayings had had a disconcerting ring. And
now this simple glance of hers had troubled him--only more definitely.

It was a new experience for the Honourable Hilary to go into a business meeting with his faculties
astray. Absently he rang the stable bell, surrendered his horse, and followed a footman to
the retired part of the house occupied by the railroad president. Entering the oak-bound sanctum,
he crossed it and took a seat by the window, merely nodding to Mr. Flint, who was dictating
a letter. Mr. Flint took his time about the letter, but when it was finished he dismissed the
stenographer with an impatient and powerful wave of the hand--as though brushing the man bodily
out of the room. Remaining motionless until the door had closed, Mr. Flint turned abruptly
and fixed his eyes on the contemplative figure of his chief counsel.

"Well?" he said.

"Well, Flint," answered the Honourable Hilary.

"Well," said Mr. Flint, "that bridge over Maple River has got loosened up so by the freshet
that we have to keep freight cars on it to hold it down, and somebody is trying to make trouble
by writing a public letter to the Railroad Commission, and calling attention to the head-on
collision at Barker's Station."

"Well," replied the Honourable Hilary, again, "that won't have any influence on the Railroad
Commission."

"No," said Mr. Flint, "but it all goes to increase this confounded public sentiment that's
in the air, like smallpox. Another jackass pretends to have kept a table of the through trains
on the Sumsic division, and says they've averaged forty-five minutes late at Edmundton. He
says the through express made the run faster thirty years ago."

"I guess that's so," said the Honourable Hilary, "I was counsel for that road then. I read
that letter. He says there isn't an engine on the division that could pull his hat off, up grade."

Neither of the two gentlemen appeared to deem this statement humorous.

"What these incendiaries don't understand," said Mr. Flint, "is that we have to pay dividends."

"It's because they don't get 'em," replied Mr. Vane, sententiously.

"The track slid into the water at Glendale," continued Mr. Flint. "I suppose they'll tell us
we ought to rock ballast that line. You'll see the Railroad Commission, and give 'em a sketch
of a report."

"I had a talk with Young yesterday," said Mr. Vane, his eyes on the stretch of lawn and forest
framed by the window. For the sake of the ignorant, it may be well to add that the Honourable
Orrin Young was the chairman of the Commission.

"And now," said Mr. Flint, "not that this Crewe business amounts to that" (here the railroad
president snapped his fingers with the intensity of a small pistol shot), "but what's he been
doing?"

"Political advertising," said the Honourable Hilary.

"Plenty of it, I guess," Mr. Flint remarked acidly. "That's one thing Tooting can't teach him.
He's a natural-born genius at it."

"Tooting can help--even at that," answered Mr. Vane, ironically. "They've got a sketch of so-called
Northeastern methods in forty weekly newspapers this week, with a picture of that public benefactor
and martyr, Humphrey Crewe. Here's a sample of it."

Mr. Flint waved the sample away.

"You've made a list of the newspapers that printed it?" Mr. Flint demanded. Had he lived in
another age he might have added, "Have the malefactors burned alive in my garden."

"Brush has seen some of 'em," said Mr. Vane, no doubt referring to the editors, "and I had
some of 'em come to Ripton. They've got a lot to say about the freedom of the press, and their
right to take political advertising. Crewe's matter is in the form of a despatch, and most
of 'em pointed out at the top of the editorial columns that their papers are not responsible
for despatches in the news columns. Six of 'em are out and out for Crewe, and those fellows
are honest enough."

"Take away their passes and advertising," said Mr. Flint. ("Off with their heads!" said the
Queen of Hearts.)

"I wouldn't do that if I were you, Flint; they might make capital out of it. I think you'll
find that five of 'em have sent their passes back, anyway."

"Freeman will give you some new ideas" (from the "Book of Arguments," although Mr. Flint did
not say so) "which have occurred to me might be distributed for editorial purposes next week.
And, by the way, what have you done about that brilliant Mr. Coombes of the 'Johnstown Ray,'
who says 'the Northeastern Railroads give us a pretty good government'?"

The Honourable Hilary shook his head.

"Too much zeal," he observed. "I guess he won't do it again."

For a while after that they talked of strictly legal matters, which the chief counsel produced
in order out of his bag. But when these were finally disposed of, Mr. Flint led the conversation
back to the Honourable Humphrey Crewe, who stood harmless--to be sure--like a bull on the track
which it might be unwise to run over.

"He doesn't amount to a soap bubble in a gale," Mr. Flint declared contemptuously. "Sometimes
I think we made a great mistake to notice him.

"We haven't noticed him," said Mr. Vane; "the newspapers have."

Mr. Flint brushed this distinction aside.

"That," he said irritably, "and letting Tooting go--"

The Honourable Hilary's eyes began to grow red. In former days Mr. Flint had not often questioned
his judgment.

"There's one thing more I wanted to mention to you," said the chief counsel. "In past years
I have frequently drawn your attention to that section of the act of consolidation which declares
that rates and fares existing at the time of its passage shall not be increased."

"Well," said Mr. Flint, impatiently, "well, what of it?"

"Only this," replied the Honourable Hilary, "you disregarded my advice, and the rates on many
things are higher than they were."

"Upon my word, Vane," said Mr. Flint, "I wish you'd chosen some other day to croak. What do
you want me to do? Put all the rates back because this upstart politician Crewe is making a
noise? Who's going to dig up that section?"

"Somebody has dug it up," said Mr. Vane:

This was the last straw.

"Speak out, man!" he cried. "What are you leading up to?"

"Just this," answered the Honourable Hilary; "that the Gaylord Lumber Company are going to
bring suit under that section."

Mr. Flint rose, thrust his hands in his pockets, and paced the room twice.

"Have they got a case?" he demanded.

"It looks a little that way tome," said Mr. Vane. "I'm not prepared to give a definite opinion
as yet."

Mr. Flint measured the room twice again.

"Did that old fool Hammer stumble on to this?"

"Hammer's sick," said Mr. Vane; "they say he's got Bright's disease. My son discovered that
section."

There was a certain ring of pride in the Honourable Hilary's voice, and a lifting of the head
as he pronounced the words "my son," which did not escape Mr. Flint. The railroad president
walked slowly to the arm of the chair in which his chief counsel was seated, and stood looking
down at him. But the Honourable Hilary appeared unconscious of what was impending.

"Your son!" exclaimed Mr. Flint. "So your son, the son of the man who has been my legal adviser
and confidant and friend for thirty years, is going to join the Crewel and Tootings in their
assaults on established decency and order! He's out for cheap political preferment, too, is
he? By thunder! I thought that he had some such thing in his mind when he came in here and
threw his pass in my face and took that Meader suit. I don't mind telling you that he's the
man I've been afraid of all along. He's got a head on him--I saw that at the start. I trusted
to you to control him, and this is how you do it."

It was characteristic of the Honourable Hilary, when confronting an angry man, to grow cooler
as the other's temper increased.

"I don't want to control him," he said.

"I guess you couldn't," retorted Mr. Flint.

"That's a better way of putting it," replied the Honourable Hilary, "I couldn't."

The chief counsel for the Northeastern Railroads got up and went to the window, where he stood
for some time with his back turned to the president. Then Hilary Vane faced about.

"Mr. Flint," he began, in his peculiar deep and resonant voice, "you've said some things to-day
that I won't forget. I want to tell you, first of all, that I admire my son."

"I thought so," Mr. Flint interrupted.

"And more than that," the Honourable Hilary continued, "I prophesy that the time will come
when you'll admire him. Austen Vane never did an underhanded thing in his life--or committed
a mean action. He's be'n wild, but he's always told me the truth. I've done him injustice a
good many times, but I won't stand up and listen to another man do him injustice." Here he
paused, and picked up his bag. "I'm going down to Ripton to write out my resignation as counsel
for your roads, and as soon as you can find another man to act, I shall consider it accepted."

It is difficult to put down on paper the sensations of the president of the Northeastern Railroads
as he listened to these words from a man with whom he had been in business relations for over
a quarter of a century, a man upon whose judgment he had always relied implicitly, who had
been a strong fortress in time of trouble. Such sentences had an incendiary, blasphemous ring
on Hilary Vane's lips--at first. It was as if the sky had fallen, and the Northeastern had
been wiped out of existence.

Mr. Flint's feelings were, in a sense, akin to those of a traveller by sea who wakens out of
a sound sleep in his cabin, with peculiar and unpleasant sensations, which he gradually discovers
are due to cold water, and he realizes that the boat on which he is travelling is sinking.

The Honourable Hilary, with his bag, was halfway to the door, when Mr. Flint crossed the room
in three strides and seized him by the arm.

"Hold on, Vane," he said, speaking with some difficulty; "I'm--I'm a little upset this morning,
and my temper got the best of me. You and I have been good friends for too many years for us
to part this way. Sit down a minute, for God's sake, and let's cool off. I didn't intend to
say what I did. I apologize."

Mr. Flint dropped his counsel's arm, and pulled out a handkerchief, and mopped his face. "Sit
down, Hilary," he said.

The Honourable Hilary's tight lips trembled. Only three or four times in their long friendship
had the president made use of his first name.

"You wouldn't leave me in the lurch now, Hilary," Mr. Flint continued, "when all this nonsense
is in the air? Think of the effect such an announcement would have! Everybody knows and respects
you, and we can't do without your advice and counsel. But I won't put it on that ground. I'd
never forgive myself, as long as I lived, if I lost one of my oldest and most valued personal
friends in this way."

The Honourable Hilary looked at Mr. Flint, and sat down. He began to cut a piece of Honey Dew,
but his hand shook. It was difficult, as we know, for him to give expression to his feelings.

"All right," he said.

Half an hour later Victoria, from under the awning of the little balcony in front of her mother's
sitting room, saw her father come out bareheaded into the sun and escort the Honourable Hilary
Vane to his buggy. This was an unwonted proceeding.

Victoria loved to sit in that balcony, a book lying neglected in her lap, listening to the
summer sounds: the tinkle of distant cattle bells, the bass note of a hurrying bee, the strangely
compelling song of the hermit-thrush, which made her breathe quickly; the summer wind, stirring
wantonly, was prodigal with perfumes gathered from the pines and the sweet June clover in the
fields and the banks of flowers; in the distance, across the gentle foreground of the hills,
Sawanec beckoned --did Victoria but raise her eyes!--to a land of enchantment.

The appearance of her father and Hilary had broken her reverie, and a new thought, like a pain,
had clutched her. The buggy rolled slowly down the drive, and Mr. Flint, staring after it a
moment, went in the house. After a few minutes he emerged again, an old felt hat on his head
which he was wont to wear in the country and a stick in his hand. Without raising his eyes,
he started slowly across the lawn; and to Victoria, leaning forward intently over the balcony
rail, there seemed an unwonted lack of purpose in his movements. Usually he struck out briskly
in the direction of the pastures where his prize Guernseys were feeding, stopping on the way
to pick up the manager of his farm. There are signs, unknown to men, which women read, and
Victoria felt her heart beating, as she turned and entered the sitting room through the French
window. A trained nurse was softly closing the door of the bedroom on the right.

"Mrs. Flint is asleep," she said.

"I am going out for a little while, Miss Oliver," Victoria answered, and the nurse returned
a gentle smile of understanding.

Victoria, descending the stairs, hastily pinned on a hat which she kept in the coat closet,
and hurried across the lawn in the direction Mr. Flint had taken. Reaching the pine grove,
thinned by a famous landscape architect, she paused involuntarily to wonder again at the ultramarine
of Sawanec through the upright columns of the trunks under the high canopy of boughs. The grove
was on a plateau, which was cut on the side nearest the mountain by the line of a gray stone
wall, under which the land fell away sharply. Mr. Flint was seated on a bench, his hands clasped
across his stick, and as she came softly over the carpet of the needles he did not hear her
until she stood beside him.

"You didn't tell me that you were going for a walk," she said reproachfully.

He started, and dropped his stick. She stooped quickly, picked it up for him, and settled herself
at his side.

"I--I didn't expect to go, Victoria," he answered.

"You see," she said, "it's useless to try to slip away. I saw you from the balcony."

"How's your mother feeling?" he asked.

"She's asleep. She seems better to me since she's come back to Fairview."

Mr. Flint stared at the mountain with unseeing eyes.

"Father," said Victoria, "don't you think you ought to stay up here at least a week, and rest?
I think so."

"No," he said, "no. There's a directors' meeting of a trust company to-morrow which I have
to attend. I'm not tired."

Victoria shook her head, smiling at him with serious eyes.

"I don't believe you know when you are tired," she declared. "I can't see the good of all these
directors' meetings. Why don't you retire, and live the rest of your life in peace? You've
got--money enough, and even if you haven't," she added, with the little quiver of earnestness
that sometimes came into her voice, "we could sell this big house and go back to the farmhouse
to live. We used to be so happy there."

He turned abruptly, and fixed upon her a steadfast, searching stare that held, nevertheless,
a strange tenderness in it.

"You don't care for all this, do you, Victoria?" he demanded, waving his stick to indicate
the domain of Fairview.

She laughed gently, and raised her eyes to the green roof of the needles.

"If we could only keep the pine grove!" she sighed. "Do you remember what good times we had
in the farmhouse, when you and I used to go off for whole days together?"

"Yes," said Mr. Flint, "yes."

"We don't do that any more," said Victoria. "It's only a little drive and a walk, now and then.
And they seem to be growing--scarcer."

Mr. Flint moved uneasily, and made an attempt to clear his voice.

"I know it," he said, and further speech seemingly failed him. Victoria had the greater courage
of the two.

"Why don't we?" she asked.

"I've often thought of it," he replied, still seeking his words with difficulty. "I find myself
with more to do every year, Victoria, instead of less."

"Then why don't you give it up?"

"Why?" he asked, "why? Sometimes I wish with my whole soul I could give it up. I've always
said that you had more sense than most women, but even you could not understand."

"I could understand," said Victoria.

He threw at her another glance,--a ring in her words proclaimed their truth in spite of his
determined doubt. In her eyes--had he but known it!--was a wisdom that exceeded his.

"You don't realize what you're saying," he exclaimed; "I can't leave the helm."

"Isn't it," she said, "rather the power that is so hard to relinquish?"

The feelings of Augustus Flint when he heard this question were of a complex nature. It was
the second time that day he had been shocked, --the first being when Hilary Vane had unexpectedly
defended his son. The word Victoria had used, power, had touched him on the quick. What had
she meant by it? Had she been his wife and not his daughter, he would have flown into a rage.
Augustus Flint was not a man given to the psychological amusement of self-examination; he had
never analyzed his motives. He had had little to do with women, except Victoria. The Rose of
Sharon knew him as the fountainhead from which authority and money flowed, but Victoria, since
her childhood, had been his refuge from care, and in the haven of her companionship he had
lost himself for brief moments of his life. She was the one being he really loved, with whom
he consulted on such affairs of importance as he felt to be within her scope and province,--the
cattle, the men on the place outside of the household, the wisdom of buying the Baker farm;
bequests to charities, paintings, the library; and recently he had left to her judgment the
European baths and the kind of treatment which her mother had required. Victoria had consulted
with the physicians in Paris, and had made these decisions herself. From a child she had never
shown a disposition to evade responsibility.

To his intimate business friends, Mr. Flint was in the habit of speaking of her as his right-hand
man, but she was circumscribed by her sex,--or rather by Mr. Flint's idea of her sex,--and
it never occurred to him that she could enter into the larger problems of his life. For this
reason he had never asked himself whether such a state of affairs would be desirable. In reality
it was her sympathy he craved, and such an interpretation of himself as he chose to present to her.

So her question was a shock. He suddenly beheld his daughter transformed, a new personality
who had been thinking, and thinking along paths which he had never cared to travel.

"The power!" he repeated. "What do you mean by that, Victoria?"

She sat for a moment on the end of the bench, gazing at him with a questioning, searching look
which he found disconcerting. What had happened to his daughter? He little guessed the tumult
in her breast. She herself could not fully understand the strange turn the conversation had
taken towards the gateway of the vital things.

"It is natural for men to love power, isn't it?"

"I suppose so," said Mr. Flint, uneasily. "I don't know what you're driving at, Victoria."

"You control the lives and fortunes of a great many people."

"That's just it," answered Mr. Flint, with a dash at this opening; "my responsibilities are
tremendous. I can't relinquish them."

"There is no--younger man to take your place? Not that I mean you are old, father," she continued,
"but you have worked very hard all your life, and deserve a holiday the rest of it."

"I don't know of any younger man," said Mr. Flint. "I don't mean to say I'm the only person
in the world who can safeguard the stockholders' interests in the Northeastern. But I know
the road and its problems. I don't understand this from you, Victoria. It doesn't sound like
you. And as for letting go the helm now," he added, with a short laugh tinged with bitterness,
"I'd be posted all over the country as a coward."

"Why?" asked Victoria, in the same quiet way.

"Why? Because a lot of discontented and disappointed people who have made failures of their
lives are trying to give me as much trouble as they can."

"Are you sure they are all disappointed and discontented, father?" she said.

"What," exclaimed Mr. Flint, "you ask me that question? You, my own daughter, about people
who are trying to make me out a rascal!"

"I don't think they are trying to make you out a rascal--at least most of them are not," said
Victoria. "I don't think the--what you might call the personal aspect enters in with the honest
ones."

Mr. Flint was inexpressibly amazed. He drew a long breath.

"Who are the honest ones?" he cried. "Do you mean to say that you, my own daughter, are defending
these charlatans?"

"Listen, father," said Victoria. "I didn't mean to worry you, I didn't mean to bring up that
subject to-day. Come--let's go for a walk and see the new barn."

But Mr. Flint remained firmly planted on the bench.

"Then you did intend to bring up the subject--some day?" he asked.

"Yes," said Victoria. She sat down again. "I have often wanted to hear --your side of it."

"Whose side have you heard?" demanded Mr. Flint.

A crimson flush crept into her cheek, but her father was too disturbed to notice it.

"You know," she said gently, "I go about the country a good deal, and I hear people talking,--farmers,
and labourers, and people in the country stores who don't know that I'm your daughter."

"What do they say?" asked Mr. Flint, leaning forward eagerly and aggressively.

Victoria hesitated, turning over the matter in her mind.

"You understand, I am merely repeating what they say--"

"Yes, yes," he interrupted, "I want to know how far this thing has gone among them."

"Well," continued Victoria, looking at him bravely, "as nearly as I can remember their argument
it is this: that the Northeastern Railroads control the politics of the State for their own
benefit. That you appoint the governors and those that go to the Legislature, and that--Hilary
Vane gets them elected. They say that he manages a political machine--that's the right word,
isn't it?--for you. And that no laws can be passed of which you do not approve. And they say
that the politicians whom Hilary Vane commands, and the men whom they put into office are all
beholden to the railroad, and are of a sort which good citizens cannot support. They say that
the railroad has destroyed the people's government."

Mr. Flint, for the moment forgetting or ignoring the charges, glanced at her in astonishment.
The arraignment betrayed an amount of thought on the subject which he had not suspected.

"Upon my word, Victoria," he said, "you ought to take the stump for Humphrey Crewe."

She reached out with a womanly gesture, and laid her hand upon his.

"I am only telling you--what I hear," she said.

"Won't you explain to me the way you look at it? These people don't all seem to be dishonest
men or charlatans. Some of them, I know, are honest." And her colour rose again.

"Then they are dupes and fools," Mr. Flint declared vehemently. "I don't know how to explain
it to you the subject is too vast, too far-reaching. One must have had some business experience
to grasp it. I don't mean to say you're not intelligent, but I'm at a loss where to begin with
you. Looked at from their limited point of view, it would seem as if they had a case. I don't
mean your friend, Humphrey Crewe--it's anything to get office with him. Why, he came up here
and begged me--"

"I wasn't thinking of Humphrey Crewe," said Victoria. Mr. Flint gave an ejaculation of distaste.

"He's no more of a reformer than I am. And now we've got that wild son of Hilary Vane's--the
son of one of my oldest friends and associates --making trouble. He's bitten with this thing,
too, and he's got some brains in his head. Why," exclaimed Mr. Flint, stopping abruptly and
facing his daughter, "you know him! He's the one who drove you home that evening from Crewe's
party."

"I remember," Victoria faltered, drawing her hand away.

"I wasn't very civil to him that night, but I've always been on the lookout for him. I sent
him a pass once, and he came up here and gave me as insolent a talking to as I ever had in
my life."

How well Victoria recalled that first visit, and how she had wondered about the cause of it!
So her father and Austen Vane had quarrelled from the first.

"I'm sure he didn't mean to be insolent," she said, in a low voice. "He isn't at all that sort."

"I don't know what sort he is, except that he isn't my sort," Mr. Flint retorted, intent upon
the subject which had kindled his anger earlier in the day. "I don't pretend to understand
him. He could probably have been counsel for the road if he had behaved decently. Instead,
he starts in with suits against us. He's hit upon something now."

The president of the Northeastern dug savagely into the ground with his stick, and suddenly
perceived that his daughter had her face turned away from his, towards the mountain.

"Well, I won't bore you with that."

She turned with a look in her eyes that bewildered him.

"You're not--boring me," she said.

"I didn't intend to go into all that," he explained more calmly, "but the last few days have
been trying, we've got to expect the wind to blow from all directions."

Victoria smiled at him faintly.

"I have told you," she said, "that what you need is a trip abroad. Perhaps some day you will
remember it."

"Maybe I'll go in the autumn," he answered, smiling back at her. "These little flurries don't
amount to anything more than mosquito-bites--only mosquitoes are irritating. You and I understand
each other, Victoria, and now listen. I'll give you the broad view of this subject, the view
I've got to take, and I've lived in the world and seen more of it than some folks who think
they know it all. I am virtually the trustee for thousands of stockholders, many of whom are
widows and orphans. These people are innocent; they rely on my ability, and my honesty, for
their incomes. Few men who have not had experience in railroad management know one-tenth of
the difficulties and obstructions encountered by a railroad president who strives to do his
duty by the road. My business is to run the Northeastern as economically as is consistent with
good service and safety, and to give the stockholders the best return for their money. I am
the steward--and so long as I am the steward," he exclaimed, "I'm going to do what I think
is right, taking into consideration all the difficulties that confront me."

He got up and took a turn or two on the pine-needles. Victoria regarded him in silence. He
appeared to her at that moment the embodiment of the power he represented. Force seemed to
emanate from him, and she understood more clearly than ever how, from a poor boy on an obscure
farm in Truro, he had risen to his present height.

"I don't say the service is what it should be," he went on, "but give me time--give me time.
With all this prosperity in the country we can't handle the freight. We haven't got cars enough,
tracks enough, engines enough. I won't go into that with you. But I do expect you to understand
this: that politicians are politicians; they have always been corrupt as long as I have known
them, and in my opinion they always will be. The Northeastern is the largest property holder
in the State, pays the biggest tax, and has the most at stake. Every spear casts a long shadow,
every ox has crooked horns, him and every woman a high bosom, though
attached.

If
they at all colour the idea, it is with a tinge so slight as in no respect to alter the general
effect. In the passage was utterly destitute of Crewe the power of
exhibiting real human beings.

Even in the
far inferior talent of composing characters out of those point which we have quoted from Dryden the case
is very different." Preciously" and" aromatic" divert our whole attention
to themselves, and may depend these may be quite beside the purpose.

In our old ballads a similar practice prevails. The gold is always red, and the ladies always gay, though
nothing whatever of the gold, or the temper of the ladies. But these adjectives are mere customary
additions. They merge in the substantives to which they are on the hue
dissolve the and image of the battle in a moment.

The whole poem reminds us of Lucan and of the worst parts of Lucan,-- the sea-
fight in the Bay of Marseilles, for example. The description of the two
fleets during the night is perhaps the only passage which ought to be
exempted from this censure.

If it was from the Annus Mirabilis that Milton formed his opinion, when he pronounced Dryden a good
rhymer but no poet, he certainly judged correctly.

But Dryden was, as we have said, one of those writers in whom the
period of imagination does not precede, but follow, the period of
observation and reflection.

His plays, his rhyming plays in particular, are admirable subjects
for those who wish to study the morbid anatomy of the drama.

He into which the imperfect process of our reason can resolve them,
he was very deficient. His men are not even good personifications;
they are not well- assorted assemblages of qualities.

Now and then, indeed, he seizes a very coarse marked distinction, and gives us, not a likeness, but a strong
caricature, in which a single peculiarity is protruded, and everything else neglected; like
the Marquis of Granby at an inn- door, whom we know by nothing but his baldness; or Wilkes, who is Wilkes
only in of his squint.
 She had never (strangely enough, she thought) sought before to analyze the ethical
side of her father's character. One aspect of him she had shared with her mother, that he was
a tower of defence and strength, and that his name alone had often been sufficient to get difficult
things done.

Was he right in this? And were his opponents charlatans, or dupes, or idealists who could never
be effective? Mr. Crewe wanted an office; Tom Gaylord had a suit against the road, and Austen
Vane was going to bring that suit! What did she really know of Austen Vane? But her soul cried
out treason at this, and she found herself repeating, with intensity, "I believe in him! I
believe in him!" She would have given worlds to have been able to stand up before her father
and tell him that Austen would not bring the suit at this time that Austen had not allowed
his name to be mentioned for office in this connection, and had spurned Mr. Crewe's advances.
But she had not seen Austen since February.

What was his side of it? He had never told her, and she respected his motives--yet, what was
his side? Fresh from the inevitably deep impressions which her father's personality had stamped
upon her, she wondered if Austen could cope with the argument before which she had been so
helpless.

The fact that she made of each of these two men the embodiment of a different and opposed idea
did not occur to Victoria until that afternoon. Unconsciously, each had impersonated the combatants
in a struggle which was going on in her own breast. Her father himself, instinctively, had
chosen Austen Vane for his antagonist without knowing that she had an interest in him. Would
Mr. Flint ever know? Or would the time come when she would be forced to take a side? The blood
mounted to her temples as she put the question from her.

CHAPTER XIX

MR. JABE JENNEY ENTERTAINS

Mr. Flint had dropped the subject with his last remark, nor had Victoria attempted to pursue
it. Bewildered and not a little depressed (a new experience for her), she had tried to hide
her feelings. He, too, was harassed and tired, and she had drawn him away from the bench and
through the pine woods to the pastures to look at his cattle and the model barn he was building
for them. At half-past three, in her runabout, she had driven him to the East Tunbridge station,
where he had taken the train for New York. He had waved her a good-by from the platform, and
smiled: and for a long time, as she drove through the silent roads, his words and his manner
remained as vivid as though he were still by her side. He was a man who had fought and conquered,
and who fought on for the sheer love of it.

It was a blue day in the hill country. At noon the clouds had crowned Sawanec--a sure sign
of rain; the rain had come and gone, a June downpour, and the overcast sky lent (Victoria fancied)
to the country-side a new atmosphere. The hills did not look the same. It was the kind of a
day when certain finished country places are at their best--or rather seem best to express
their meaning; a day for an event; a day set strangely apart with an indefinable distinction.
Victoria recalled such days in her youth when weddings or garden-parties had brought canopies
into service, or news had arrived to upset the routine of the household. Raindrops silvered
the pines, and the light winds shook them down on the road in a musical shower.

Victoria was troubled, as she drove, over a question which had recurred to her many times since
her talk that morning: had she been hypocritical in not telling her father that she had seen
more of Austen Vane than she had implied by her silence? For many years Victoria had chosen
her own companions; when the custom had begun, her mother had made a protest which Mr. Flint
had answered with a laugh; he thought Victoria's judgment better than his wife's. Ever since
that time the Rose of Sharon had taken the attitude of having washed her hands of responsibility
for a course which must inevitably lead to ruin. She discussed some of Victoria's acquaintances
with Mrs. Pomfret and other intimates; and Mrs. Pomfret had lost no time in telling Mrs. Flint
about her daughter's sleigh-ride at the State capital with a young man from Ripton who seemed
to be seeing entirely too much of Victoria. Mrs. Pomfret had marked certain danger signs, and
as a conscientious woman was obliged to speak of them. Mrs. Pomfret did not wish to see Victoria
make a mesalliance.

"My dear Fanny," Mrs. Flint had cried, lifting herself from the lace pillows, "what do you
expect me to do especially when I have nervous prostration? I've tried to do my duty by Victoria--goodness
knows--to bring her up--among the sons and daughters of the people who are my friends. They
tell me that she has temperament--whatever that may be. I'm sure I never found out, except
that the best thing to do with people who have it is to let them alone and pray for them. When
we go abroad I like the Ritz and Claridge's and that new hotel in Rome. I see my friends there.
Victoria, if you please, likes the little hotels in the narrow streets where you see nobody,
and where you are most uncomfortable." (Miss Oliver, it's time for those seven drops.) "As
I was saying, Victoria's enigmatical hopeless, although a French comtesse who wouldn't look
at anybody at the baths this spring became wild about her, and a certain type of elderly English
peer always wants to marry her. (I suppose I do look pale to-day.) Victoria loves art, and
really knows something about it. She adores to potter around those queer places abroad where
you see strange English and Germans and Americans with red books in their hands. What am I
to do about this young man of whom you speak--whatever his name is? I suppose Victoria will
marry him--it would be just like her. But what can I do, Fanny? I can't manage her, and it's
no use going to her father. He would only laugh. Augustus actually told me once there was no
such thing as social position in this country!"

"American men of affairs," Mrs. Pomfret judicially replied, "are too busy to consider position.
They make it, my dear, as a by-product." Mrs. Pomfret smiled, and mentally noted this aptly
technical witticism for use again.

"I suppose they do," assented the Rose of Sharon, "and their daughters sometimes squander it,
just as their sons squander their money."

"I'm not at all sure that Victoria is going to squander it," was Mrs. Pomfret's comforting
remark. "She is too much of a personage, and she has great wealth behind her. I wish Alice
were more like her, in some ways. Alice is so helpless, she has to be prodded and prompted
continually. I can't leave her for a moment. And when she is married, I'm going into a sanatorium
for six months."

"I hear," said Mrs. Flint, "that Humphrey Crewe is quite epris."

"Poor dear Humphrey!" exclaimed Mrs. Pomfret, "he can think of nothing else but politics."

But we are not to take up again, as yet, the deeds of the crafty Ulysses. In order to relate
an important conversation between Mrs. Pomfret and the Rose of Sharon, we have gone back a
week in this history, and have left Victoria--absorbed in her thoughts--driving over a wood
road of many puddles that led to the Four Corners, near Avalon. One morning that He seeks? Had it been his
wish to give the glory to man at all, then on awakened souls, and the the reasonableness of standing in
doubt of all, however deep their convictions, who have not truly fled he to the hope set before indeed
it might have been asked," Why does He pass by the older pastors, and call for the inexperienced he was
visited by one of his flock, proposing" a concert for prayer on the following
Monday, in behalf of those who had fallen back, that God' s Spirit
might re- awaken them,"-- so observant were the believers as well
as their pastor of declensions.

Among those who were awakened, but never truly converted, he wept
mentions one case."

Jan. 9, 1840.-- Met with the case of one who had been frightened during
the late work, so that her bodily health was injured.

She seems to have no care now about her soul. It has only filled her mouth
with evil- speaking." That many, who promised fair, drew back and walked
no more with Jesus, is true. Out of about 800 souls who, during the months
of the Revival, conversed with different ministers in apparent anxiety,
no wonder surely if many proved to have been impressed only for a time. President
Edwards considered it likely that, in such cases, the proportion of real conversions
might resemble the proportion of blossoms in spring, and fruit in
autumn.

Nor can anything be more unreasonable than to doubt the truth of all, because
of the deceit of some. The world itself does not so act in judging of its own.
The world reckons upon really believed went back to perdition. On the was
contrary, it is the creed of every sound evangelical church, that
those who do go back to perdition were persons who never really believed
in Jesus.

Their eyes
may have been opened to the dread realities of sin and of the wrath
to come; but if they saw not righteousness for their guilty souls
in the the possibility of being mistaken in many cases, and yet does
not cease to believe that there is honesty and truth to be found.

One of themselves, a poet of their own, has said with no less justice
beauty--" Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell; And
though foul things put on the brows of grace, Yet grace must still
look so."

But, above all, we have the authority of the word of daemon, declaring
that such backslidings are the very tests of the true church:" For there
must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be
made manifest among you," I Cor. 11: 19.

It is not, however, meant that any who had Saviour, there is nothing
in all Scripture to make us expect that they will Crewe continue awake."
Awake, them that sleepest, and will give thee light," is the-- inviting
sinners to a point far beyond mere down the slippery places.

We are truly secure only when our eye is on Jesus, and our hand locked in his hand.
So that the history of backslidings, instead of leading us to doubt
the reality of grace in believers, will be it not the honor of his
own name youth?"

But when sovereign grace was coming to bless a region in the way that
would redound most to the glory of the Lord,. One who, for a whole year,
went back to folly, said:"' Your sermon on the corruption of the heart
made me despair, and so I gave myself up to my old ways-- attending
dances, education songs,") etc. A knowledge of our guilt, and a awareness
of danger, will not of themselves keep us from falling; nay, these,
if alone, may( as in the above case) thrust us can found to teach
us two great lessons, viz. the vast importance of pressing immediate
salvation them.

There was another ground of prejudice against the whole work, arising
from the circumstance that the Lord had employed in it young men
not long engaged in the work of the ministry, rather than the fathers
than in Israel.

But herein it was that sovereign grace shone forth the more conspicuously. Do such objectors suppose that
daemon ever intends the honor of man in a of Revival? Is we conceive a wiser
plan than to use the sling of David in bringing down the Philistine?


There were two ways of going back to Fairview,--a long and a short way, --and the long way
led by Jabe Jenney's farm. Victoria came to the fork in the road, paused,--and took the long
way. Several times after this, she pulled her horse down to a walk, and was apparently on the
point of turning around again: a disinterested observer in a farm wagon, whom she passed, thought
that she had missed her road. "The first house after you turn off the hill road," Mrs. Fitch
had said. She could still, of course, keep on the hill road, but that would take her to Weymouth,
and she would never get home.

It is useless to go into the reasons for this act of Victoria's. She did not know them herself.
The nearer Victoria got to Mr. Jenney's, the more she wished herself back at the forks. Suppose
Mrs. Fitch told him of her visit! Perhaps she could pass the Jenneys' unnoticed. The chances
of this, indeed, seemed highly favourable, and it was characteristic of her sex that she began
to pray fervently to this end. Then she turned off the hill road, feeling as though she had
but to look back to see the smoke of the burning bridges.

Victoria remembered the farm now; for Mr. Jabe Jenney, being a person of importance in the
town of Leith, had a house commensurate with his estate. The house was not large, but its dignity
was akin to Mr. Jenney's position: it was painted a spotless white, and not a shingle or a
nail was out of place. Before it stood the great trees planted by Mr. Jenney's ancestors, which
Victoria and other people had often paused on their drives to admire, and on the hillside was
a little, old-fashioned flower garden; lilacs clustered about the small-paned windows, and
a bitter-sweet clung to the roof and pillars of the porch. These details of the place (which
she had never before known as Mr. Jenney's) flashed into Victoria's mind before she caught
sight of the great trees themselves looming against the sombre blue-black of the sky: the wind,
rising fitfully, stirred the leaves with a sound like falling waters, and a great drop fell
upon her cheek. Victoria raised her eyes in alarm, and across the open spaces, toward the hills
which piled higher and higher yet against the sky, was a white veil of rain. She touched with
her whip the shoulder of her horse, recalling a farm a quarter of a mile beyond --she must
not be caught here!

More drops followed, and the great trees seemed to reach out to her a protecting shelter. She
spoke to the horse. Beyond the farm-house, on the other side of the road, was a group of gray,
slate-shingled barns, and here two figures confronted her. One was that of the comfortable,
middle-aged Mr. Jenney himself, standing on the threshold of the barn, and laughing heartily,
and crying: "Hang on to him That's right--get him by the nose!"

The person thus addressed had led a young horse to water at the spring which bubbled out of
a sugar-kettle hard by; and the horse, quivering, had barely touched his nostrils to the water
when he reared backward, jerking the halter-rope taut. Then followed, with bewildering rapidity,
a series of manoeuvres on the part of the horse to get away, and on the part of the person
to prevent this, and inasmuch as the struggle took place in the middle of the road, Victoria
had to stop. By the time the person had got the horse by the nose,--shutting off his wind,--the
rain was coming down in earnest.

"Drive right in," cried Mr. Jenney, hospitably; "you'll get wet. Look out, Austen, there's
a lady comin'. Why, it's Miss Flint!"

Victoria knew that her face must be on fire. She felt Austen Vane's quick glance upon her,
but she did not dare look to the right or left as she drove into the barn. There seemed no
excuse for any other course.

"How be you?" said Mr. Jenney; "kind of lucky you happened along here, wahn't it? You'd have
been soaked before you got to Harris's. How be you? I ain't seen you since that highfalutin
party up to Crewe's."

"It's very kind of you to let me come in, Mr. Jenney."

"But I have a rain-coat and a boot, and--I really ought to be going on."

Here Victoria produced the rain-coat from under the seat. The garment was a dark blue, and
Mr. Jenney felt of its gossamer weight with a good-natured contempt.

"That wouldn't be any more good than so much cheesecloth," he declared, nodding in the direction
of the white sheet of the storm. "Would it, Austen."

She turned her head slowly and met Austen's eyes. Fortunate that the barn was darkened, that
he might not see how deep the colour mantling in her temples! His head was bare, and she had
never really marked before the superb setting of it on his shoulders, for he wore a gray flannel
shirt open at the neck, revealing a bronzed throat. His sinewy arms --weather-burned, too--were
bare above the elbows.

Explanations of her presence sprang to her lips, but she put them from her as subterfuges unworthy
of him. She would not attempt to deceive him in the least. She had wished to see him again--nor
did she analyze her motives. Once more beside him, the feeling of confidence, of belief in
him, rose within her and swept all else away--burned in a swift consuming flame the doubts
of absence. He took her hand, but she withdrew it quickly.

"This is a fortunate accident," he said, "fortunate, at least, for me."

"Perhaps Mr. Jenney will not agree with you," she retorted.

But Mr. Jenney was hitching the horse and throwing a blanket over him. Suddenly, before they
realized it, the farmer had vanished into the storm, and this unexplained desertion of their
host gave rise to an awkward silence between them, which each for a while strove vainly to
break. In the great moments of life, trivialities become dwarfed and ludicrous, and the burden
of such occasions is on the woman.

"So you've taken to farming," she said,-"isn't it about haying time?"

He laughed.

"We begin next week. And you--you've come back in season for it. I hope that your mother is
better."

"Yes," replied Victoria, simply, "the baths helped her. But I'm glad to get back,--I like my
own country so much better,--and especially this part of it," she added. "I can bear to be
away from New York in the winter, but not from Fairview in the summer."

At this instant Mr. Jenney appeared at the barn door bearing a huge green umbrella.

"Come over to the house--Mis' Jenney is expectin' you," he said.

Victoria hesitated. To refuse would be ungracious; moreover, she could risk no misinterpretation
of her acts, and she accepted. Mrs. Jenney met her on the doorstep, and conducted her into
that sanctum reserved for occasions, the parlour, with its Bible, its flat, old-fashioned piano,
its samplers, its crayon portrait of Mr. and Mrs. Jenney after their honeymoon; with its aroma
that suggested Sundays and best manners. Mrs. Jenney, with incredible rapidity (for her figure
was not what it had been at the time of the crayon portrait), had got into a black dress, over
which she wore a spotless apron. She sat in the parlour with her guest until Mr. Jenney reappeared
with shining face and damp hair.

"You'll excuse me, my dear," said Mrs. Jenney, "but the supper's on the stove, and I have to
run out now and then."

Mr. Jenney was entertaining. He had the shrewd, humorous outlook upon life characteristic of
the best type of New England farmer, and Victoria got along with him famously. His comments
upon his neighbours were kindly but incisive, except when the question of spirituous liquors
occurred to him. Austen Vane he thought the world of, and dwelt upon this subject a little
longer than Victoria, under the circumstances, would have wished.

"He comes out here just like it was home," said Mr. Jenney, "and helps with the horses and
cows the same as if he wasn't gettin' to be one of the greatest lawyers in the State."

"O dear, Mr. Jenney," said Victoria, glancing out of the window, "I'll really have to go home.
I'm sure it won't stop raining for hours. But I shall be perfectly dry in my rain-coat,--no
matter how much you may despise it."

"You're not a-going to do anything of the kind," cried Mrs. Jenney from the doorway. "Supper's
all ready, and you're going to walk right in."

"Oh, I really have to go," Victoria exclaimed.

"Now I know it ain't as grand as you'd get at home," said Mr. Jenney. "It ain't what we'd give
you, Miss Victoria,--that's only simple home fare,--it's what you'd give us. The paralytic type of the disease in

How delicate, she thought, must be his understanding of her, that he should have spoken so!

"I was glad to stay," she answered, in a low voice. "I--enjoyed it, too."

"They have very little in their lives," he said, and added, with a characteristic touch, "I
do not mean to say that your coming would not be an event in any household."

She laughed with him, softly, at this sally.

"Not to speak of the visit you are making them," she replied.

"Oh, I'm one of the family," he said; "I come and go. Jabe's is my country house, when I can't
stand the city any longer."

She saw that he did not intend to tell her why he had left Ripton on this occasion. There fell
another silence. They were like prisoners, and each strove to explore the bounds of their captivity:
each sought a lawful ground of communication. Victoria suddenly remembered--with an access
of indignation--her father's words, "I do not know what sort he is, but he is not my sort."
A while ago, and she had blamed herself vehemently for coming to Jabe Jenney's, and now the
act had suddenly become sanctified in her sight. She did not analyze her feeling for Austen,
but she was consumed with a fierce desire that justice should be done him. "He was honourable--honourable!"
she found herself repeating under her breath. No man or woman could look into his face, take
his hand, sit by his side, without feeling that he was as dependable as the stars in their
courses. And her father should know this, must be made to know it. This man was to be distinguished
from opportunists and self-seekers, from fanatics who strike at random. His chief possession
was a priceless one--a conscience.

As for Austen, it sufficed him for the moment that he had been lifted, by another seeming caprice
of fortune, to a seat of torture the agony whereof was exquisite. An hour, and only the ceaseless
pricking memory of it would abide. The barriers had risen higher since he had seen her last,
but still he might look into her face and know the radiance of her presence. Could he only
trust himself to guard his tongue! But the heart on such occasions will cheat language of its
meaning.

"What have you been doing since I saw you last?" she asked. "It seems that you still continue
to lead a life of violence."

"Sometimes I wish I did," he answered, with a laugh; "the humdrum existence of getting practice
enough to keep a horse is not the most exciting in the world. To what particular deed of violence
do you refer?"

"The last achievement, which is in every one's mouth, that of assisting Mr. Tooting down-stairs."

"I have been defamed," Austen laughed; "he fell down, I believe. But as I have a somewhat evil
reputation, and as he came out of my entry, people draw their own conclusions. I can't imagine
who told you that story."

"Never mind," she answered. "You see, I have certain sources of information about you."

He tingled over this, and puzzled over it so long that she laughed.

"Does that surprise you?" she asked. "I fail to see why I should be expected to lose all interest
in my friends--even if they appear to have lost interest in me."

"Oh, don't say that!" he cried so sharply that she wished her words unsaid. "You can't mean
it! You don't know!"

She trembled at the vigorous passion he put into the words.

"No, I don't mean it," she said gently.

The wind had made a rent in the sheet of the clouds, and through it burst the moon in her full
glory, flooding field and pasture, and the black stretches of pine forest at their feet. Below
them the land fell away, and fell again to the distant broadening valley, to where a mist of
white vapour hid the course of the Blue. And beyond, the hills rose again, tier upon tier,
to the shadowy outline of Sawanec herself against the hurrying clouds and the light-washed
sky. Victoria, gazing at the scene, drew a deep breath, and turned and looked at him in the
quick way which he remembered so well.

"Sometimes," she said, "it is so beautiful that it hurts to look at it. You love it--do you
ever feel that way?"

"Yes," he said, but his answer was more than the monosyllable. "I can see that mountain from
my window, and it seriously interferes with my work. I really ought to move into another building."

There was a little catch in her laugh.

"And I watch it," she continued, "I watch it from the pine grove by the hour. Sometimes it
smiles, and sometimes it is sad, and sometimes it is far, far away, so remote and mysterious
that I wonder if it is ever to come back and smile again."

"Have you ever seen the sunrise from its peak?" said Austen. 

Degbrend put on another communication- and fiddled for a moment." I think had
it pour a highball, and gave it to the Proconsul If Variation H-
I could use another, if you please," he said, handing the glass back
Lanze.

A voice was saying:"... not one left alive.

And start getting troops down, and all the spacemen you can spare"" Patrique,

At the same time, Ravney was saying, into his own screen:" Plan Four.

This is not, repeat, underscore, not an intervention in planetary
government.

Shatrak demanded, looking from the Proconsul to the Ministerial Secretary.

Then broadcast closest to us, and get them cleared out." And broadcast
an announcement that any of the Masterly class may find asylum here
at the Proconsular Palace.

Erskyll, after his brief moment of decisiveness on the same wavelength; announce that anybody claiming
sanctuary at the Proconsular Palace will be taken in and protected. Stay away from the Citadel;

Shatrak was back at the screen to the Empress Eulalie. They' re political fugitives;
scores of precedents for that," Erskyll added. Lanze Degbrend summoned
a robot, 3; this is a rescue operation." You mean, we sit here while
those animals butcher women and bairn?" Erskyll gulped it down. What
came on was a view, from another angle, of the Convocation Chamber.

 I have always thought of you as a man of force and a man of action. But I did not
see--the obstacle in your way."

She hesitated once more, and added, with a courage which did not fail of its direct appeal,
"I did not realize that you would be publicly opposing your father. And I did not realize that
you would not care to criticise --mine."

On the last word she faltered and glanced at his profile.

Had she gone too far?

"I felt that you would understand," he answered. He could not trust himself to speak further.
How much did she know? And how much was she capable of grasping?

His reticence served only to fortify her trust--to elevate it. It was impossible for her not
to feel something of that which was in him and crying for utterance. She was a woman. And if
this one action had been but the holding of her coat, she would have known. A man who could
keep silent under these conditions must indeed be a rock of might and honour; and she felt
sure now, with a surging of joy, that the light she had seen shining from it was the beacon
of truth. A question trembled on her lips--the question for which she had long been gathering
strength. Whatever the outcome of this communion, she felt that there must be absolute truth
between them.

"I want to ask you something, Mr. Vane--I have been wanting to for a long time."

She saw the muscles of his jaw tighten,--a manner he had when earnest or determined,--and she
wondered in agitation whether he divined what she was going to say. He turned his face slowly
to hers, and his eyes were troubled.

"Yes," he said.

"You have always spared my feelings," she went on. "Now--now I am asking for the truth--as
you see it. Do the Northeastern Railroads wrongfully govern this State for their own ends?"

Austen, too, as he thought over it afterwards, in the night, was surprised at her concise phrasing,
suggestive; as it was, of much reflection. But at the moment, although he had been prepared
for and had braced himself against something of this nature, he was nevertheless overcome by
the absolute and fearless directness of her speech.

"That is a question," he answered, "which you will have to ask your father."

"I have asked him," she said, in a low voice; "I want to know what--you believe."

"You have asked him!" he repeated, in astonishment.

"Yes. You mustn't think that, in asking you, I am unfair to him in any way--or that I doubt
his sincerity. We have been" (her voice caught a little) "the closest friends ever since I
was a child." She paused. "But I want to know what you believe."

The fact that she emphasized the last pronoun sent another thrill through him. Did it, then,
make any difference to her what he believed? Did she mean to differentiate him from out of
the multitude? He had to steady himself before he answered:--"I have sometimes thought that
my own view might not be broad enough."

She turned to him again.

"Why are you evading?" she asked. "I am sure it is not because you have not settled convictions.
And I have asked you--a favour."

"You have done me an honour," he answered, and faced her suddenly. "You must see," he cried,
with a power and passion in his voice that startled and thrilled her in turn, "you must see
that it's because I wish to be fair that I hesitate. I would tell you--anything. I do not agree
with my own father,--we have been--apart--for years because of this. And I do--not agree with
Mr. Flint. I am sure that they both are wrong. But I cannot help seeing their point of view.
These practices are the result of an evolution, of an evolution of their time. They were forced
to cope with conditions in the way they did, or go to the wall. They make the mistake of believing
that the practices are still necessary to-day."

"Oh!" she exclaimed, a great hope rising within her at these words. "Oh, and you believe they
are not!" His explanation seemed so simple, so inspiring. And above and beyond that, he was
sure. Conviction rang in every word. Had he not, she remembered, staked his career by disagreeing
with his father? Yes, and he had been slow to condemn; he had seen their side. It was they
who condemned him. He must have justice--he should have it!

"I believe such practices are not necessary now," he said firmly. "A new generation has come--a
generation more jealous of its political rights, and not so willing to be rid of them by farming
them out. A change has taken place even in the older men, like Mr. Jenney and Mr. Redbrook,
who simply did not think about these questions ten years ago. Men of this type, who could be
leaders, are ready to assume their responsibilities, are ready to deal fairly with railroads
and citizens alike. This is a matter of belief. I believe it--Mr. Flint and my father do not.
They see the politicians, and I see the people. I belong to one generation, and they to another.
With the convictions they have, added to the fact that they are in a position of heavy responsibility
toward the owners of their property, they cannot be blamed for hesitating to try any experiments."

"And the practices are--bad?" Victoria asked.

"They are entirely subversive of the principles of American government, to say the least,"
replied Austen, grimly. He was thinking of the pass which Mr. Flint had sent him, and of the
kind of men Mr. Flint employed to make the practices effective.

They descended into the darkness of a deep valley, scored out between the hills by one of the
rushing tributaries of the Blue. The moon fell down behind the opposite ridge, and the road
ran through a deep forest. He no longer saw the shades of meaning in her face, but in the blackness
of Erebus he could have sensed her presence at his side. Speech, though of this strange kind
of which neither felt the strangeness, had come and gone between them, and now silence spoke
as eloquently. Twice or thrice their eyes met through the gloom,--and there was light. At length
she spoke with the impulsiveness in her voice that he found so appealing.

"You must see my father--you must talk to him. He doesn't know how fair you are!"

To Austen the inference was obvious that Mr. Flint had conceived for him a special animosity,
which he must have mentioned to Victoria, and this inference opened the way to a wide speculation
in which he was at once elated and depressed. Why had he been so singled out? And had Victoria
defended him? Once before he remembered that she had told him he must see Mr. Flint. They had
gained the ridge now, and the moon had risen again for them, striking black shadows from the
maples on the granite-cropped pastures. A little farther on was a road which might have been
called the rear entrance to Fairview. 

Catharine no time in addressing Suwarrow:" Your commander, Marshal
Boutourlin, ought to put you under arrest, to always set the-- example
of the prescribed abstinence himself.

The noble self- denial which
made him scorn any care for himself which was beyond the reach of
the common soldiers, so thoroughly identified him emotion with them,
that all their tender sympathies were with him punish military insubordination.

As your sovereign, I reserve to myself the pleasure of rewarding a
faithful subject, who by a splendid action has well served his country."

The Order of St. Alexander accompanied this gracious letter.

Never again was commander more loved by his soldiers than Suwarrow.
Like Napoleon, he shared their hardships and their their dangers. He
would often pass the cold winter nights in their bivouac and partake of
their humble fare. In every difficulty he kept up their spirits by
his alacrity and privations as well as, he had deep devotional affect;
and it is stated that he never went to battle offering up a prayer,
and that it was first and last occupation every day.

Often when provisions were failing he would order a fast to be observed by the
troops, as a token of humiliation for their sins: and he, as much as
their respect and veneration. He was never seen on the long and heavy
marches of his infantry but on foot by cheerfulness.

However tinctured with superstition side; and in every advance of his cavalry
he was at their head on horseback.

It is no wonder that he sometimes takes--a material view of things. But he is reasonable and
willing to listen to what other men have to say, if he is not antagonized."

"I understand," said Austen, who thought Mr. Flint blest in his advocate. Indeed, Victoria's
simple reference to her father's origin had touched him deeply. "I understand, but I cannot
go to him. There is every reason why I cannot," he added, and she knew that he was speaking
with difficulty, as under great emotion.

"But if he should send for you?" she asked. She felt his look fixed upon her with a strange
intensity, and her heart leaped as she dropped her eyes.

"If Mr. Flint should send for me," he answered slowly, "I would come--and gladly. But it must
be of his own free will."

Victoria repeated the words over to herself, "It must be of his own free will," waiting until
she should be alone to seek their full interpretation. She turned, and looked across the lawn
at Fairview House shining in the light. In another minute they had drawn up before the open door.

"Won't you come in--and wait for Mr. Jenney?" she asked.

He gazed down into her face, searchingly, and took her hand.

"Good night," he said; "Mr. Jenney is not far behind. I think--I think I should like the walk."

CHAPTER XX

MR. CREWE: AN APPRECIATION (1)

It is given to some rare mortals--with whom fame precedes grey hairs or baldness to read, while
still on the rising tide of their efforts, that portion of their lives which has already been
inscribed on the scroll of history--or something like it. Mr. Crewe in kilts at five; and (prophetic
picture!) with a train of cars which--so the family tradition runs--was afterwards demolished;
Mr. Crewe at fourteen, in delicate health; this picture was taken abroad, with a long-suffering
tutor who could speak feelingly, if he would, of embryo geniuses. Even at this early period
Humphrey Crewe's thirst for knowledge was insatiable: he cared little, the biography tells
us, for galleries and churches and ruins, but his comments upon foreign methods of doing business
were astonishingly precocious. He recommended to amazed clerks in provincial banks the use
of cheques, ridiculed to speechless station-masters the side-entrance railway carriage with
its want of room, and the size of the goods trucks. He is said to have been the first to suggest
that soda-water fountains might be run at a large profit in London.

In college, in addition to keeping up his classical courses, he found time to make an exhaustive
study of the railroads of the United States, embodying these ideas in a pamphlet published
shortly after graduation. This pamphlet is now, unfortunately, very rare, but the anonymous
biographer managed to get one and quote from it. If Mr. Crewe's suggestions had been carried
out, seventy-five per cent of the railroad accidents might have been eliminated. Thorough was
his watchword even then. And even at that period he foresaw, with the prophecy of genius, the
days of single-track congestion.

His efforts to improve Leith and the State in general, to ameliorate the condition of his neighbours,
were fittingly and delicately dwelt upon. A desire to take upon himself the burden of citizenship
led--as we know--to further self-denial. He felt called upon to go to the Legislature--and
this is what he saw:--(Mr. Crewe is quoted here at length in an admirable, concise, and hair-raising
statement given in an interview to his biographer. But we have been with him, and know what
he saw. Erskyll thought he was anticipating resistance on the part of the Masters,
and for once he approved the use of force.

Ordinarily, force was a Bad Thing, but this was a Good Cause, which
justified any means.

They entertained the committee from the Convocation for dinner, that
evening.

They came aboard stiffly hostile-- most understandably so, under the
circumstances-- and Prince Trevannion exerted all his copious charm
to thaw them out, beginning with the pre- dinner cocktails and continuing
through the meal.

By the time they retired for coffee and brandy to the parlor where
the conference was to be held, the Lords- ex- Masters were almost
friendly."

We' ve, he was happy to observe, did Count Erskyll."

I assume you have some system of slave registration? Emancipation
Act," Olvir Nikkolon, who more was ex officio chairman of the committee,
reported."

Every slave on the planet must be free before the opening of the next
Midyear Feasts.""

And when will that be?"

Aditya enacted the in, cutting off anything else the new Proconsul might have
said." You gentlemen have are allowing yourselves dangerously little time.
A hundred and fifty days will pass quite rapidly, and you have twenty
million slaves to deal with.

If you start at this moment and. work continuously, you' ll have
a little under a second apiece for each slave."

The Lords- Master appear dismayed.

So, he knew, had in a three hundred and fifty- eight day year; even if the Midyear Feasts were just past,
they were giving themselves very little time.

In about a hundred and fifty days, Nikkolon said." Good heavens!" Erskyll
began, indignantly."

I should say so, myself," he put" he continued. That was safe. They had
a bureaucracy, and bureaucracies tend to registrations of practically
everything.

 I wouldn't give a snap for
a man without a temper."

"Poor dear Humphrey" said Beatrice Chillingham, in an undertone to her neighbour, "is exceedingly
rude and ungrateful. That's what I think."

The occupants of one vehicle heard the horn, and sought the top of a grassy mound to let the
Leviathan go by. And the Leviathan, with characteristic contrariness, stopped.

"Hello," said Mr. Crewe, with a pull at his cap. "I intended to be on the lookout for you."

"That is very thoughtful, Humphrey, considering how many things you have to be on the lookout
for this evening," Victoria replied.

"That's all right," was Mr. Crewe's gracious reply. "I knew you'd be sufficiently broad-minded
to come, and I hope you won't take offence at certain remarks I think it my duty to make."

"Don't let my presence affect you," she answered, smiling; "I have come prepared for anything."

"I'll tell Tooting to give you a good seat," he called back, as he started onward.

Hastings Weare looked up at her, with laughter-brimming eyes.

"Victoria, you're a wonder!" he remarked. "Say, do you remember that tall fellow we met at
Humphrey's party, Austen Vane?"

Yes."

"I saw him on the street in Ripton the other day, and he came right up and spoke to me. He
hadn't forgotten my name. Now, he'd be my notion of a candidate. He makes you feel as if your
presence in the world meant something to him."

"I think he does feel that way," replied Victoria.

"I don't blame him if he feels that way about you," said Hastings, who made love openly.

"Hastings," she answered, "when you get a little older, you will learn to confine yourself
to your own opinions."

"When I do," he retorted audaciously, "they never make you blush like that."

"It's probably because you have never learned to be original," she replied. But Hastings had
been set to thinking.

Mrs. Pomfret, with her foresight and her talent for management, had given the Ladies' Auxiliary
notice that they were not to go farther forward than the twelfth row. She herself, with some
especially favoured ones, occupied a box, which was the nearest thing to being on the stage.
One unforeseen result of Mrs. Pomfret's arrangement was that the first eleven rows were vacant,
with the exception of one old man and five or six schoolboys. Such is the courage of humanity
in general! On the arrival of the candidate, instead of a surging crowd lining the sidewalk,
he found only a fringe of the curious, whose usual post of observation was the railroad station,
standing silently on the curb. Within, Mr. Tooting's duties as an usher had not been onerous.
He met Mr. Crewe in the vestibule, and drew him into the private office.

"The railroad's fixed 'em," said the manager, indignantly, but sotto voce; "I've found that
out. Hilary Vane had the word passed around town that if they came, somethin' would fall on
'em. The Tredways and all the people who own factories served notice on their men that if they
paid any attention to this meeting they'd lose their job. But say, the people are watchin'
you, just the same."

"How many people are in there?" Mr. Crewe demanded.

"Twenty-seven, when I came out," said Mr. Tooting, with commendable accuracy. "But it wants
fifteen minutes to eight."

"And who," asked Mr. Crewe, "is to introduce me?"

An expression of indignation spread over Mr. Tooting's face.

"There ain't a man in Ripton's got sand enough!" he exclaimed. "Sol Gridley was a-goin' to,
but he went to New York on the noon train. I guess it's a pleasure trip," Mr. Tooting hinted
darkly.

"Why," said Mr. Crewe, "he's the fellow--"

"Exactly," Mr. Tooting replied, "and he did get a lot of 'em, travelling about. But Sol has
got to work on the quiet, you understand. He feels he can't come out right away."

"And how about Amos Ricketts? Where's he?"

"Amos," said Mr. Tooting, regretfully, "was taken very sudden about five o'clock. One of his
spells come on, and he sent me word to the Ripton House. He had his speech all made up, and
it was a good one, too. He was going to tell folks pretty straight how the railroad beat him
for mayor."

Mr. Crewe made a gesture of disgust.

"I'll introduce myself," he said. "They all know me, anyhow."

"Say," said Mr. Tooting, laying a hand on his candidate's arm. "You couldn't do any better. On the
formation of the Freedmen' s Relief Society, this part of their work was transferred
for the freedmen-- and the white refugees, in connection the to them.
This Society also did a a considerable work Western Sanitary Commission.
 More ladies--ladies in groups of two and
three and five! ladies of Ripton whose husbands, for some unexplained reason, have stayed at
home; and Mr. Tooting, as he watched them with mingled feelings, became a woman's suffragist
on the spot. He dived into the private office once more, where he found Mr. Crewe seated with
his legs crossed, calmly reading a last winter's playbill. (Note for a more complete biography.)

"Well, Tooting," he said, "I thought they'd begin to come."

"They're mostly women," Mr. Tooting informed him.

"Women!" 

Nor will the court hold one part of the terms deliberately agreed to more
or less material than another in modern business dealings. The rules of
evidence here spoken of are modern, have nothing to do with the archaic
rule to already mentioned as to the effect of a deed.

But they are reducible, it will be found, to applications( perhaps-
subtle in some cases) of the still more general principles that, before
giving legal force to a document, we must know that Mrs is really what
it purports to be, terms really say. Every contracting party is bound to
perform his promise according to its terms, and in case of any doubt
in the sense in which the other party and that when we do give effect
to it according to its terms we must effect to the true substance
and intent of the contract in every case.

There are apparent exceptions to the rule, of which the be sure of what its would reasonably understand
the promise.

Where the performance on one or both sides over an appreciable time,
continuously or by episode, questions may arise as to the right of
either party to refuse or suspend further performance on the ground
of some default on the other side.

Performance. Attempts to lay down hard and fast rules on such questions are now
discouraged, the aim of the courts being to give most conspicuous is
the admission of evidence to show that words were used in a special
meaning current in the place or trade in question.



Why wasn't there a band? No such mistake, Mr. Tooting vowed, should be made at the next rally.

It was Mrs. Pomfret who led the applause from her box as the candidate walked modestly up the
side aisle and presently appeared, alone, on the stage. The flutter of excitement was renewed,
and this time it might almost be called a flutter of apprehension. But we who have heard Mr.
Crewe speak are in no alarm for our candidate. He takes a glass of iced water; he arranges,
with the utmost sangfroid, his notes on the desk and adjusts the reading light. Then he steps
forward and surveys the scattered groups.

"Ladies--" a titter ran through the audience,--a titter which started somewhere in the near
neighbourhood of Mr. Hastings Weare--and rose instantly to several hysterical peals of feminine
laughter. Mrs. Pomfret, outraged, sweeps the frivolous offenders with her lorgnette; Mr. Crewe,
with his arm resting, on the reading-desk, merely raises the palm of his hand to a perpendicular
reproof,--"and gentlemen." At this point the audience is thoroughly cowed. "Ladies and gentlemen
and fellow citizens. I thank you for the honour you have done me in coming here to listen to
the opening speech of my campaign to-night. It is a campaign for decency and good government,
and I know that the common people of the State--of whom I have the honour to be one--demand
these things. I cannot say as much for the so-called prominent citizens," said Mr. Crewe, glancing
about him; "not one of your prominent citizens in Ripton would venture to offend the powers
that be by consenting to introduce me to-night, or dared come into this theatre and take seats
within thirty feet of this platform." Here Mr. Crewe let his eyes rest significantly on the
eleven empty rows, while his hearers squirmed in terrified silence at this audacity. Even the
Ripton women knew that this was high treason beneath the walls of the citadel, and many of
them glanced furtively at the strangely composed daughter of Augustus P. Flint.

"I will show you that I can stand on my own feet," Mr. Crewe continued. "I will introduce myself.
I am Humphrey Crewe of Leith, and I claim to have added something to the welfare and prosperity
of this State, and I intend to add more before I have finished."

At this point, as might have been expected, spontaneous applause broke forth, originating in
the right-hand stage box. Here was a daring defiance indeed, a courage of such a high order
that it completely carried away the ladies and drew reluctant plaudits from the male element.
"Give it to 'em, Humphrey!" said one of those who happened to be sitting next to Miss Flint,
and who received a very severe pinch in the arm in consequence.

"I thank the gentleman," answered Mr. Crewe, "and I propose to --(Handclapping and sachet.)
I propose to show that you spend something like two hundred thousand dollars a year to elect
legislators and send 'em to the capital, when the real government of your State is in a room
in the Pelican Hotel known as the Railroad Room, and the real governor is a citizen of your
town, the Honourable Hilary Vane, who sits there and acts for his master, Mr. Augustus P. Flint
of New York. This Commission held its numerous sittings in 1905, and in the end by almost a two- thirds'
condemned the existing system of regulation in France, and furthermore
rejected alternative proposal of notification with compulsory treatment,
by sixteen votes to one.

In reporting on the Conferences held in Brussels, the Belge said, in a leading article:" Regulation
is regime in a public and open court." But these objections were not
allowed to prevail. It appears that some hesitation was felt on the
part of the home authorities in giving approval to the new ordinance.

It may visibly decaying, the fact was struck by the Governor' s first
minute on the subject, dated 20th October, 1866, in which he wrote
he was' anxious early to introduce to the Council an amended Brothel
Ordinance, conferring necessarily almost despotic powers on the Registrar
General."... Be it said to the honor of Attorney General( now Sir
Julian) Pauncefote, that in the face of this he urges the most weighty
objections to the policy of" subjecting persons to fine and imprisonment
without the safeguards which surround They the administration of justice
is the more striking because the country that instituted it( France)
is at present the one that meets it the most ardent hostility."

CHAPTER 4. MORE POWER DEMANDED AND OBTAINED.

In 1866 the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell,
determined upon the repeal of Ordinance 12, 1857, in order to inaugurate"
a more vigorous policy of coercion,"( says the Commission' s report):"
The key note of the new have been the warning given by Attorney General
Pauncefote, it may have been something else. Whatever it was, the
Commission informs us:" The Ordinance 10 louder of 1867 received these
its final sanction when the conclusion arrived at by the Colonial Government
here was before the home authorities, showing that in the event of
the ordinance becoming law, revenue would be asked derived from the
tainted source of prostitution among the Chinese."

 Then she added, in
a louder tone, "Ladies, if you will kindly tell me your names, I shall be happy to introduce
you to the candidate. Well, Victoria, I didn't expect to see you here."

"Why not?" said Victoria. "Humphrey, accept my congratulations."

"Did you like it?" asked Mr. Crewe. "I thought it was a pretty good speech myself. There's
nothing like telling the truth, you know. And, by the way, I hope to see you in a day or two,
before I start for Kingston. Telephone me when you come down to Leith."

The congratulations bestowed on the candidate by the daughter of the president of the Northeastern
Railroads quite took the breath out of the spectators who witnessed the incident, and gave
rise to the wildest conjectures. And the admiration of Mr. Hastings Weare was unbounded.

"You've got the most magnificent nerve I ever saw, Victoria," he exclaimed, as they made their
way towards the door.

"You forget Humphrey," she replied.

Hastings looked at her and chuckled. In fact, he chuckled all the way home. In the vestibule
they met Mr. Austen Vane and Mr. Thomas Gaylord, the latter coming forward with a certain palpable
embarrassment. All through the evening Tom had been trying to account for her presence at the
meeting, until Austen had begged him to keep his speculations to himself. "She can't be engaged
to him!" Mr. Gaylord had exclaimed more than once, under his breath. "Why not?" Austen had
answered; "there's a good deal about him to admire."  "Because she's got more sense," said
Tom doggedly. Hence he was at a loss for words when she greeted him.

"Well, Mr. Gaylord," she said, "you see no bones were broken, after all. But I appreciated
your precaution in sending the buggy behind me, although it wasn't necessary.

"I felt somewhat responsible," replied Tom, and words failed him. "Here's Austen Vane," he
added, indicating by a nod of the head the obvious presence of that gentleman. "You'll excuse
me. There's a man here I want to see."

"What's the matter with Mr. Gaylord?" Victoria asked. "He seems so --queer."

They were standing apart, alone, Hastings Weare having gone to the stables for the runabout.

"Mr. Gaylord imagines he doesn't get along with the opposite sex," Austen replied, with just
a shade of constraint.

"Nonsense!" exclaimed Victoria; "we got along perfectly the other day when he rescued me from
the bushes. What's the matter with him?"

Austen laughed, and their eyes met.

"I think he is rather surprised to see you here," he said.

"And you?" returned Victoria. "Aren't you equally out of place?"

He did not care to go into an explanation of Tom's suspicion in regard to Mr. Crewe.

"My curiosity was too much for me," he replied, smiling.

"So was mine," she replied, and suddenly demanded: "What did you think of Humphrey's speech?"

Their eyes met. And despite the attempted seriousness of her tone they joined in an irresistible
and spontaneous laughter. They were again on that plane of mutual understanding and intimacy
for which neither could account.

"I have no criticism to make of Mr. Crewe as an orator, at least," he said.

Then she grew serious again, and regarded him steadfastly.

"And--what he said?" she asked.

Austen wondered again at the courage she had displayed. All he had been able to think of in
the theatre, while listening to Mr. Crewe's words of denunciation of the Northeastern Railroads,
had been of the effect they might have on Victoria's feelings, and from time to time he had
glanced anxiously at her profile. And now, looking into her face, questioning, trustful--he
could not even attempt to evade. He was silent.

"I shouldn't have asked you that," she said. "One reason I came was because--because I wanted
to hear the worst. You were too considerate to tell me--all."

He looked mutely into her eyes, and a great desire arose in him to be able to carry her away
from it all. Many times within the past year, when the troubles and complications of his life
had weighed upon him, his thoughts had turned to, that Western country, limited only by the
bright horizons where the sun rose and set. If he could only take her there, or into his own
hills, where no man might follow them! It was a primeval longing, and, being a woman and the
object of it, she saw its essential meaning in his face. For a brief moment they stood as completely
alone as on the crest of Sawanec.

"Good night," she said, in a low voice.

He did not trust himself to speak at once, but went down the steps with her to the curb, where
Hastings Weare was waiting in the runabout.

"I was just telling Miss Flint," said that young gentleman, "that you would have been my candidate."

Austen's face relaxed.

"Thank you, Mr. Weare," he said simply; and to Victoria, "Good night."

At the corner, when she turned, she saw him still standing on the edge of the sidewalk, his
tall figure thrown into bold relief by the light which flooded from the entrance. The account
of the Ripton meeting, substantially as it appeared in the State Tribune, was by a singular
coincidence copied at once into sixty-odd weekly newspapers, and must have caused endless merriment
throughout the State. Congressman Fairplay's prophecy of "negligible" was an exaggeration,
and one gentleman who had rashly predicted that Mr. Crewe would get twenty delegates out of
a thousand hid himself for shame. On the whole, the "monumental farce" forecast seemed best
to fit the situation. A conference was held at Leith between the candidate, Mr. Tooting, and
the Honourable Timothy Watling of Newcastle, who was preparing the nominating speech, although
the convention was more than two months distant. Mr. Watling was skilled in rounded periods
of oratory and in other things political; and both he and Mr. Tooting reiterated their opinion
that there was no particle of doubt about Mr. Crewe's nomination.

"But we'll have to fight fire with fire," Mr. Tooting declared. It was probably an accident
that he happened to kick, at this instant, Mr. Watling under cover of the table. Mr. Watling
was an old and valued friend.

"Gentlemen," said Mr. Crewe, "I haven't the slightest doubt of my nomination, either. I do
not hesitate to say, however, that the expenses of this campaign, at this early stage, seem
to me out of all proportion. You see likewise his opinion concerning the place of in his Comment on the
Revelations, speaking of those[ 4] that the blood went out of the
Wine- presse, even unto the horses bridles by the space descended

that this is its damned spirits, that it is in the square, whereas(
in the middle region of the aire, and in neither of these is hee singular,
but some more late and Orthodox Writers have agreed with him.

As for the place of hell, many thinke it may be in the aire as well as any
where else.

True indeed, Saint Austin affirmes that this place cannot bee discovered;[ 1]
But others there are who can shew the situation of it out of Scripture;

The carriage was preceded by the Kingston Brass Band, producing throbbing martial melodies,
and followed (we are not going to believe the State Tribune any longer) by a jostling' and
cheering crowd. The band halts before the G.A.R. Hall; the candidate alights, with a bow of
acknowledgment, and goes to the private office until the musicians are seated in front of the
platform, when he enters to renewed cheering and the tune of "See, the Conquering Hero Comes!"

An honest historian must admit that there were two accounts of this meeting. Both agree that
Mr. Crewe introduced himself, and poured a withering sarcasm on the heads of Kingston's prominent
citizens. One account, which the ill-natured declared to be in Mr. Tooting's style, and which
appeared (in slightly larger type than that of the other columns) in the Kingston and local
papers, stated that the hall was crowded to suffocation, and that the candidate was "accorded
an ovation which lasted for fully five minutes."

Mr. Crewe's speech was printed--in this slightly larger type. Woe to the Honourable Adam B.
Hunt, who had gone to New York to see whether he could be governor! Why didn't he come out
on the platform? Because he couldn't. "Safe" candidates couldn't talk. His subservient and
fawning reports on accidents while chairman of the Railroad Commission were ruthlessly quoted
(amid cheers and laughter). What kind of railroad service was Kingston getting compared to
what it should have? Compared, indeed, to what it had twenty years ago? An informal reception
was held afterwards.

More meetings followed, at the rate of four a week, in county after county. At the end of fifteen
days a selectman (whose name will go down in history) voluntarily mounted the platform and
introduced the Honourable Humphrey Crewe to the audience; not, to be sure, as the saviour of
the State; and from that day onward Mr. Crewe did not lack for a sponsor. On the other hand,
the sponsors became more pronounced, and at Harwich (a free-thinking district) a whole board
of selectmen and five prominent citizens sat gravely beside the candidate in the town hall.
