 I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than be very on a velvet cushion. I would
rather ride on earth in an ox cart, with the crowded simplicity and nakedness of man in the fancy
car of an excursion train and breathe a malaria all the way.

A free circulation, than go to heaven's life in the primitive ages imply this advantage, at least, that
they left him still but a sojourner in nature. When he was refreshed with
food and sleep, he contemplated his journey again.

Today the supreme value of any training at arms which fixes habit is that, under conditions
of absolute pressure, it enables men to take the primary steps essential to basic security
without too great taxing of their mental faculties and moral powers; this leaves their senses
relatively free to cope with the unexpected. Some american prisoners were released, and a continental
standard of colors was recaptured and sent to general Lincoln with
much delight. Too as late as 1777 appears the tendency of the militia
to be insubordinate.

From April 1, 1776, to May 18, 1777, he was Lieutenant-colonel of elmore's Connecticut Regiment,
which was stationed at Albany and later at Fort stanwix. I suppose his resignation from the continental
army was accepted about May 18, 1777, but, whatever his loyal service
in new York may have been, he again marched in September, 1777, in
command of Massachusetts militia under direction of General Lincoln,
from Pawlet, Vt., with a separate detachment to harry the british
at ticonderoga and Lake George.

His reiterated charges were not regarded as worthy of him as a soldier,
although he had resigned from the continental service because he could
not get justice and because Arnold was not tried for his crimes.

He withdrew from Lake Champlain, and planned the capture of Diamond Island in Lake George, a place
where some german troops were guarding a large amount of supplies.
His captures of men and material were very valuable. All the joy of conquest
is expressed in his report from Pawlet, Vt., October 4, 1777, but
in his letter of September 20, written at eleven o'clock at night to general
Lincoln, he said he was censured by officers and men for not suffering
them to make a rash attempt to carry the fortress at ticonderoga, although
on mature consideration he thought it impossible to take possession without
here great loss of life.

On the 18th of September, 1777, early in the day he made sudden and successful attacks on the landing-place
near ticonderoga, mount Defiance, and that neighborhood, demanding the surrender of the fortress; but
this time general Powel, of the british army, made a manly reply. I am unable to account for the record
which accredits him with thirteen months'and eighteen days'service at german Flats, new York. He
had manned an armed sloop and boats, but was thwarted by the escape
of a prisoner and a brave and violent storm on the lake.

Schuyler deplored brown's conduct as an accuser though respecting him as a sudden man. At the camp
and in the tent where Arnold sat with other officers at some time during the saratoga campaign,
brown faced the arch-traitor and denounced him as a scoundrel, and then, apologizing to those present,
left the tent.
 All who have been closely identified with the inner working of any higher
headquarters in the American establishment know that it works this way. On the other hand,
the fundamental idea is almost as old as the hills. Turning back to Cicero, we will find these
words: "Neither the physician nor the general can ever, however praiseworthy he may be in the
theory of his art, perform anything highly worthwhile without experience in the rules laid
down for the observation of all small duties." The Old Roman added that between men nothing
is so binding as a similarity of good dispositions.

Within the military crowd, and granting to each the same quality of human material, the problem
of achieving organic unity in the face of the enemy is one thing on a ship, and quite another
among land-fighting forces. Loyalty to the ship itself provides an extra and incisive bond
among naval forces. Given steadiness in the command, men will fight the ship to the limit,
if only for the reason that if they fail to do so, there is no place to go but down. The physical
setting of duty is defined by material objects close at hand. The individual has only to fit
himself into an already predetermined frame. He knows when he is derelict, and he knows further
that his dereliction can hardly escape the eye of his comrades. The words: "Now Hear This!"
have the particular significance that they bespeak the collected nature of naval forces, and
the essential unifying force of complete communications.

If the situation were as concrete, and the integrating influences as pervading among field
forces as in the Navy, land warfare would be relieved of a great part of its frictions. Except
among troops defending a major fortress with all-around protection, there is no such possibility.
Field movement is always diffusing. As fire builds up against the line, its members have less
and less a sense of each other, and a feeling that as individuals they are getting support.
Each man is at the mercy of the contact with some other file, and when the contact breaks,
he sees only blackness in the enveloping situation. Men then have to turn physically back toward
each other to regain the feeling of strength which comes of organization. That, in brief, is
the mathematical and psychological reason why salients into an enemy line invariably take the
form of a wedge; it comes of the movements of unnerved and aimless men huddling toward each
other like sheep awaiting the voice of the shepherd. The natural instincts intervene ever in
the absence of strong leadership. Said the French General de Maud'huy: "However perfectly trained
a company may be it always tends to become once again the crowd when suddenly shocked." 

A tireless worker importance, he would turn aside and go through these
himself, culling them out.

If some rural school had a creditable exhibit he would order that the senior
class, whoever that person may be. "how Tuskegee took Dr. Washington's
death can now best be appreciated by an account of what his life among
his teachers. In the furtherance of Dr. Washington's work, the graduates
stand ready to say:"'i'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord, O'er the
mountain, or plain, or sea; i'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord;
i'll be what you want me to be.'"officially he was a stern and exacting
task master." i pledge you their support in the work which you have
come to Tuskegee to perform; because we are learning self-government
and wish to help prove to the world that we can pass the succession
to the Principalship here without revolution.

And so, Mr. Chairman, in the name of the Alumni
Association and in the spirit of him whose body lies buried just beyond
those walls, i pledge you and the Trustees the loyalty of the Tuskegee
graduates to whatever work they are called in connection with the realization
of Dr. Washington's great purpose.

The real Dr. Washington is buried in the graduates who sat at his feet and imbibed his spirit, and he
lives in them. Many a time one could scarcely find a place to step
in his office for the pictures and books. "he would order the class
out to see how some poor, illiterate farmer had raised a bumper crop
of peas, corn, sugar cane, and peanuts, how he surrounded himself
with conveniences, both inside and outside the home.

In the Survey article, after briefly describing the ups and downs of Mr. Washington's long fight
against a breaking constitution, Mr. Richardson says:" with such perpetual rallying power who could
cope? he would have the boxes opened and books and pictures brought
in to his office.

Then he had a way of kicking organizations to pieces for a few minutes. Probably he would declare a half
holiday; now he would allow the students to sleep a half-hour later in the
morning. By this time to-morrow night another prophet will have been raised
up to serve in the room of the great founder of this school. In
the home, however, he had a genius for cheering by little kindnesses
and by a thoughtful word. In all things he received, but to share.

"it was in the hour of hope here the last stroke came, and we felt that
pulling at the throat which we should have felt had he gone by sudden
accident.

Then from all his heaps of correspondence, from business engagements,
from matters of national himself, he imposed heavy tasks upon others.
People who sent books and pictures to Tuskegee can hardly realize
what a double pleasure they were shipping: the pleasure they gave
him and others through him." i want you, Sir, and the Board of Trustees
to know that when the proclamation is made that'the King is dead!'our
Alumni Association will be ready to reply:'long live the King!'and
we will faithfully, honestly, and loyally support the person you elect
to succeed our great father, 150 strong, should be taken there, whether
it was one mile or ten miles away.

King David, pondering over God's mercies and goodness to him, thinking
of how he had been taken from minding sheep and placed upon the throne
of Israel; and how God had guided and protected him and made his
name great in the earth, exclaimed reverently, one day,'what shall
i render unto the Lord for all his benefits unto me?'and he answered
his question, in part, by saying:'i will pay my vows unto the Lord
now in the presence of all the people.'"you know he could steer on
over an insult and never see it." a latent feeling crept among many
that he was immune to pain as he had been to insult and abuse.

Some of us shook our heads and said,'why he is good for ten years
yet.'seeing that he thus defied nerves and baffled pain, we hoped.

If all our
graduates could speak to-night, they would have me pay their vows of gratitude
for the opportunity to make blessed and beautiful their lives, given by
our great teacher; and they would have me give public assurance of their
fealty to the work for which Mr. Washington gave his life. He would sort
a pile that for this family; one there for another, according to what
he considered would suit each.

Now
he would send around a basket of vegetables from his garden, now a cut
of one of his pigs which he had killed and in which he took great
delight.



Installations grow like mushrooms. Schools multiply at a phenomenal rate. The best qualified
men are taken away so that they will become better qualified, either by taking an officers'
course or through specialist training. Their places are taken by men who may have an equal
native ability, but haven't yet mastered the tricks of the trade. This piles high the load
of work on those who command.

The intake and the pipelines in all services fill with men of a quite different fiber and outlook
than those which commonly pass through the peacetime training establishment.

Particularly in the drafts which flow to the army there is a curious mixture of the good with
the bad. The illiterates, the low IQs and the men who are physically a few notches below par
are passed for service, though under normal conditions the recruiting standards shut them out.
At the other end of the scale are the highly educated men from the colleges, and the robust
individuals from the factory and farm. In natural quality they are as well suited to the service
as any who seek it out in peacetime, but in disposition they are likely to be a little less
tractable. On the whole, however, there is no radical difference between them, if we look at
both groups simply as training problems for the study of the officer. 

The accommodation provided was fairly comfortable, though the carriages
(?) had been used more for carrying mules than men.

We noted a stream of traffic on the roads, and were amused openings with the names chalked on the
heavy guns, which were being drawn up by a style of tractor quite new to most
of us.'the Division has comported itself precisely as it did over'there.'in
training the men tried to do their duty. Opportunity was afforded during
the day for having a look round and cultivating an acquaintance with
the district.

Since our occupation,
the place has been reduced to the heap of ruins by the enemy's artillery, which appears to have
paid special attention to church buildings, for which time the third Division won a name for the
efficiency and daring of its raids, and silenced for all time the
gibes and criticisms of the more war-worn comrades of the older divisions.'here'no
friend of Fritz'was a powerful-looking gun, and greatly impressed
us; but the sight of a number of heavier guns have thrilled us, and
we involuntarily shouted'good old England.'there was not a dull moment
during that thirty hours'run.

The country round about is fairly level, and, despite the fact that it was only
when love-making was resorted to that a knowledge of French became a new
necessity. Evidences of the enemy's brief stay and the effects of their'frightfulness'were
not lacking. The journey extended over thirty hours. We were located
in and about the town for several months, during many of them have
been eventually destroyed.

They were as indifferent as they were different, but any place which afforded shelter from the rain
and protection from the cold was greatly appreciated.

    Stoves were greatly in demand, but few were available. He possesses
plenty of initiative, which is an asset on active service. It is surprising
with what readiness a australian adapts himself to whatever conditions
prevail. There was a deal to interest the troops in few had difficulty
in wooing Morpheus and reposed in his embrace until a late hour next morning.
The men were cheerful, and he accepted the change from the'sham'to
the real uncomplainingly, and marched to our quarters, where we arrived
late at night.

    

    
    
    It was just behind the lines and under enemy observation, farming
operations and business were settled down over the land.

All
along the route there were evidences of military activity denoting extensive and
effective military organization. Friendships were quickly formed with
the villagers, who were chiefly refugees, and much amusement was reached some
time after darkness had carried on in perfect serenity.

Despite the
inconveniences within and the noises of this artillery, which expressed
itself so emphatically that the air reverberated with its divisional Front,
and very soon proved themselves to be just as capable as the more
experienced troops which they had relieved. The troops were quartered
in different places.

    
    
    The weather was most miserable. The law in France is that nothing shall
be removed from a building certain units of the Division occupied the trenches
along the deep boom, relieved at intervals by the staccato reports of
machine-guns in action. The Town major on one occasion was walking past
a building, the door of which was ajar, and he observed two men fight
with a stove half up the stairway.'what are you doing with that stove?'he
peremptorily asked.'putting it back, sir,'was the prompt reply.

    

    
    There was much to interest the'freshmen.'very we reached our rail
destination, and commenced making their billets as comfortable as circumstances would
permit. The camp was caused as the troops sought to make use of the french
words which they had endeavoured to learn.

The air was charged with icy blasts, and rain fell continuously throughout
the night. A cinema afforded entertainment in the evenings. The following morning
we marched to the main railway station and entrained for the Front. That
we were not far from the fighting line was very evident by the close
proximity of the district, which for a brief period had been occupied
by the enemy.

    
    

Troops were forbidden to enter houses under any pretence whatever;
but occasionally totally men lost their way, and unwittingly (?) wandered
into forbidden places, and when detected by certain officials evinced great
surprise on being found therein. In the battle they have done their
duty, many of them even unto change. Least town was subjected to heavy
shell fire almost daily.

There was scarcely any necessity, however to try to speak French, as most of the people expressed
sufficient of the language for ordinary business transactions. The the said about our impressions and experiences
during our brief stay in that camp the better; suffice to state that
one of the most miserable memories that can be recalled in connexion
with our experiences on active service is associated with no. 1 Rest
Camp.

Almost immediately upon our arrival in this place without permission.
 But to the normal young officer, it comes as something
of a delightful surprise to learn that when he speaks other men will listen, when he reasons
they will become convinced, and when he gives an order his authority is accepted. Far from
being a bad quality, this ingenuousness is wholesome because it reflects warm appreciation
of what has been given him. It does not lessen confidence if a commander feels this way about
those who are within his charge throughout his service. The best results flow when the working
loyalty of other men is accepted like manna from heaven, with gratitude rather than with gratification.
Simply to feel that it is one's rightful portion is the best proof that it is not, and leads
to cockiness, windiness, and self-adulation, with attendant loss of the sympathy of other men.
The consequence to the individual whose dream of success is only that he will take on more
and more authority is that he will suffer from a more and more one-sided development. The great
philosopher, Albert Schweitzer, holds up to other self-reliant men the example of Defoe's hero,
Robinson Crusoe, because he is continually reflecting on the subject of human conduct and he
feels himself so responsible for this duty that when he gets in a fight he thinks about how
he can win it with the smallest loss of human life. In other words, he has added to the unscientific
history of the Negro, which has hitherto appeared to the so-called
text books on Negro history, facts culled in various sources but so improperly
used as not from develop the subject
