WARRIOR GAP.

1.

Riding at ease in the lazy afternoon sunshine a single troop of cavalry was threading its way
in long column of twos through the bold and beautiful foothills of the Big Horn. Behind them,
glinting in the slanting rays, Cloud Peak, snow clad still although it was late in May, towered
above the pine-crested summits of the range. To the right and left of the winding trail bare
shoulders of bluff, covered only by the dense carpet of bunch grass, jutted out into the comparative
level of the eastward plain. A clear, cold, sparkling stream, on whose banks the little command
had halted for a noontide rest, went rollicking away northeastward, and many a veteran trooper
looked longingly, even regretfully, after it, and then cast a gloomy glance over the barren
and desolate stretch ahead. Far as the eye could reach in that direction the earth waves heaved
and rolled in unrelieved monotony to the very sky line, save where here and there along the
slopes black herds or scattered dots of buffalo were grazing unvexed by hunters red or white,
for this was thirty years ago, when, in countless thousands, the bison covered the westward
prairies, and there were officers who forbade their senseless slaughter to make food only for
the worthless, prowling coyotes. No wonder the trooper hated to leave the foothills of the
mountains, with the cold, clear trout streams and the bracing air, to take to long days' marching
over dull waste and treeless prairie, covered only by sage brush, rent and torn by dry ravines,
shadeless, springless, almost waterless, save where in unwholesome hollows dull pools of stagnant
water still held out against the sun, or, further still southeast among the "breaks" of the
many forks of the South Cheyenne, on the sandy flats men dug for water for their suffering
horses, yet shrank from drinking it themselves lest their lips should crack and bleed through
the shriveling touch of the alkali. 

As for the Name [Chocolate] it is an Indian word, compounded of Ate (as some say,) or (as others) Atle,
which in the Mexican Language, signifieth Water; And Choco, the noise that the Water (wherein the
Chocolate is put) maketh, when it is stirred in a Cup, untill it Bubble and rise unto a Froth: And may be called
in English A Compounded, or Confectioned drinke.

The Confection it selfe, consists of severall Ingredients according to the different Constitutions of
those that use it: the Principall of which is called Cacao, [a kind
of Nut, or kernell, bigger then a great Almond, which growes upon
a tree called the Tree of Cacao] containing in it the Quality of the
Foure Elements, as will appeare in the following Discourse.

The vertues thereof are no lesse various, then Admirable. For, besides that it preserves Health,
and makes such as drink it often, Fat, and Corpulent, faire and Amiable, it vehemently Incites to
Venus, and causeth Conception in women, hastens and facilitates their Delivery: It is an excellent help
to Digestion, it cures Consumptions, and the Cough of the Lungs, the New Disease, or Plague of the
Guts, and other Fluxes, the Green Sicknesse, Jaundise, and all manner
of Inflamations, Opilations, and Obstructions.

It quite takes away the Morphew, Cleanseth the Teeth, and sweetneth the
Breath, Provokes Urine, Cures the Stone, and strangury, Expells Poison,
and preserves from all infectious Diseases.

But I shall not assume to enumerate all the vertues of this Confection:
for that were Impossible, every day producing New and Admirable effects
in such as drinke it: I shall rather referre to the Testimony of those Noble
Personages who are known constantly to use and receive constant and
manifold benefits by it, having hereby no other Aime then the Generall
good of this Common-wealth (whereof I am a Faithfull Member) and to
be esteemed (as really I am)

The Allowance of Melchor De Lara, Physitian Generall for the Kingdome of Spaine.

I
Doctor Melchor de Lara Physitian Generall for the Kingdom of Spaine, at
the command of Don John de Velasco, and Asebedo, Vicar Generall of Madrid,
have seene this Treatise of Chocolate, composed by Antonio Colmenero of
Ledesma; which is very learned, and curious, and therefore it ought
to be Licensed for the Presse; it containing nothing contrary to good
manners; and cannot but be very pleasing to those, who are affected
to Chocolate. In testimony whereof, I have subscribed my Name, in
Madrid the 23. day of August.

The Testimoniall of John de Mena, Doctor and Physitian to the King
of Spaine.

I John de Mena, Physitian to his Majesty, and one of the Counsell Generall
of the Inquisition, have seene this Treatise of Chocolate (composed
by Doctor Antonio Colmenero of Ledesma) by command of the Supreame
Royall Court of Justice: which containeth nothing contrary to good
Manners, and the Subject if very learnedly handled, and with great
Iudgement; and no doubt, but it will give much pleasure and content
to all those, who are affected to Chocolate; and therefore may be
printed: And in confirmation of this truth, I have hereto subscribed
my Name the 17. of Septemb.

John de Mena Doctor in Physicke.

To the Reader.

The number is so great of those, who, in these times, drinke Chocolate,
that not only in the Indies, where this kind of Drink hath its originall;
but it is also much used in Spain, Italy and Flanders, and particularly
at the Cour. And many doe speake diversly of it, according to the benefit,
or hurt, they receive from it: Some saying, that it is stopping: Others,
and those the greater part, that it makes one fat: Others, that the
use of it strengthens the stomacke: Others, that it heates, and burns
them: And others say, that although they take it every houre, and in the Dogdayes,
yet they finde themselves well with it.

And therefore my desire is, to take this paines, for the pleasure,
and profit of the publicke; endeavouring to accommodate it to the
content of all, according to the variety of those things, wherewith
it may be mixt; that so every man may make choise of that, which shal
be most agreeable to his disposition.

I have not seene any, who hath written any thing, concerning this
drinke; but onely a Physitian of Marchena, who (as it seemes) writ
onely by Relation; holding an opinion, that the Chocolate is stopping,
because that Cacao (the principall Ingredient of which it is made)
is cold, and dry.

But because this onely reason, may not have power to keepe some from
the use of it, who are troubled with Opilations; I thinke fit to defend this
Confection, with Philosophicall Reasons, against any whosoever will condemne
this Drinke, which is so wholesome, and so good, knowing how to make
the Paste in that manner, that it may be agreeable to divers dispositions,
in the moderate drinking of it. And so, with all possible brevity,
shall distinguish and divide this Treatise into foure poynts, or Heads.
In the first place I shall declare, what Chocolate is; and what are
the Qualities of Cacao, and the other Ingredients of this Confection;
where I shall treate of the Receipt set downe by the aforesaid Author
of Marchena, and declare my opinion concerning the same.

The second point shall treate of the Quality, which resulteth out of the
mixture of these Simples, which are put into it. In the third place the manner
of Compounding; and how many wayes they use to drink it in the Indies. In the fourth,
and last place I shall treat of the Quantity; and how it ought to be taken;
at what time; and by what persons.

The first Point.

Concerning the first Point, I say, that Chocolate is a name of the Indians;
which in our vulgar Castilian, we may call a certaine Confection,
in which (among the Ingredients) the principall Basis, and Foundation,
is the Cacao; of whose Nature and Quality it is necessary first to
treat: And therefore I say, according to the common received opinion,
that it is cold, and dry, à prædominio; that is to say, that though
it be true, that every Simple containes in it the Qualities of the
foure Elements, in the action, and re-action, which it hath in it,
yet there results another distinct quality, which we call Complexion.

This Quality or Complexion, which ariseth of this Mixture, is not alwayes
one, and the same; neither hath it the effect in all the mixtures, but
they may be varied nine wayes; four Simple, from whence one onely quality
doth abound; and foure Compounded, from whence two Symbolizing qualities
are predominant; and one other, which we call ad pondus, which is
of all these fore-said qualities, which are in æquilibrio, that is
to say, in equall measure and degree.

Of all these the Complexion of Cacao is composed, since there arise two qualities, which are cold, and
dry; and in the substance, that rules them, hath it restringent and obstructive, of the nature of
the Element of the Earth. And then, as it is a Mixed, and not a simple Element, it must needs have parts correspondent
to the rest of the Elements; and particularly, it partakees (and that,
not a little) of those, which correspond with the Element of Aire, that
is, Heat and Moysture, which are governed by the Unctious parts;
there being drawne out of the Cacao much Butter, which, in the Indies
I have seene drawne out if it, for the Face, by the Criollas.

It may Philosophically be objected, in this manner: Two contrary Qualities,
and Disagreeing, cannot be in gradu intenso, in one and the same
Subject: Cacao is cold and drie, in predominency: Therefore, it cannot
have the qualities contrary to those; which are Heat, and Moysture.
The first Proposition is most certaine, and grounded upon good Philosophy:
The second is consented unto, by all: The third, which is the Conclusion,
is regular.

It cannot be denyed, but that the Argument is very strong, and these reasons
being considered by him of Marchena, have made him affirme, that Chocolate
is Obstructive; it seeming to be contrary to Philosophy, that in
it there should be found Heat and Moysture, in gradu intenso; and
to be so likewise in Cold and Dry.

To this, there are two things to be answered: One, that he never saw the experience of drawing out
the Butter, which I have done; and that when the Chocolate is made
without adding any thing to the dryed Powder, which is incorporated,
onely by beating it well together, and is united, and made into a Paste,
which is a signe, that there is a moist, and glutinous part, which,
of necessity, must correspond with the Element of Aire.

The other reason, we will draw from Philosophy; affirming that, in
the Cacao, there are different substances.

In the one, that is to say, in that, which is not so fat, it hath
a greater quantity of the Oylie, then of the earthie Substance; and
in the fatter part, it hath more of the earthy than of the Oily substance.
In these there is Heate and Moysture in predominancy; and in the other,
cold and dry.

Notwithstanding that it is hard to be believed, that in one and the
same substance, and so little of the Cacao, it can have substances so
different: To the end that it may appeare more easie, clear, and evident,
first we see it in the Rubarbe, which hath in it hot and soluble
parts, and parts which are Binding, Cold and Dry, which have a vertue
to strengthen, binde, and stop the loosenesse of the Belly: I say
also, that he that sees and considers the steele, so much of the nature
of the earth, as being heavy, thick, cold, and dry; it seemes to be
thought unproper for the curing of Opilations, but rather to be apt
to encrease them; and yet it is given for a proper remedy against
them.

This difficulty is cleared thus, that though it be true, that it hath
much of the Earthy part; yet it hath also parts of Sulphur, and of quick
silver, which doe open, and disopilate; neither doth it so, untill it be helped
by Art, as it is ground, stirred, and made fine, in the preparing of it; the Sulphurous
parts, and those of quick-silver, being thinne, active, and penetrative,
they mingle, at the last with those parts, which are Earthy and astringent:
Insomuch, that they being mingled after this manner one with another, we cannot
now say, that the steele is astringent, but rather, that it is penetrative,
attenuating and opening.

Let us prove this Doctrine by Authorities; and let the first be from Gallen,
l. 3. of the qualities of Simples, c. 14. Where, first of all he
teacheth, that almost all those Medicines, which, to our sence, seeme
to be Simple, are notwithstanding naturally Compounded, containing in
themselves contrary qualities; and that is to say, a quality to expell,
and to retaine; to incrassate, and attenuate; to rarifie, and to condense.
Neither are we to wonder at it, it being understood, that in every fore-said
Medicine, there is a quality to heat, and to coole; to moisten and to dry.
And whatsoever Medicine it be, it hath in it, thick, and thinne parts;
rare, and dense; soft, and hard. And in the fifteenth Chapter following,
in the same Book, he puts an example of the Broth of a Cock, which
moves the Belly; and the flesh hath the vertue to bind.

He puts also the example of the Aloes, which if it be washt, looseth the Purgative vertue; or
that which it hath, is but weake.

That this differing vertue, and faculty, is found in divers substances,
or parts of simple Medicaments, Gallen shewes in the first Booke of
his simple Medicines, and the seventeenth Chapter, bringing the example
of Milke; in which, three substances are found, and separated, that
is to say, the substance of Cheese, which hath the vertue to stop the Fluxe
of the Belly; and the substance of Whay, which is purging; and Butter,
as it is expressed in the said Gallen, Cap. 15. Also we finde in
Wine which is in the Must, three substances, that is to say, earth,
which is the chiefe; and a thinner substance, which is the flower,
and may be called the scum, or froath: and a third substance which we properly
call Wine; And every one of these substances, containes in it selfe
divers qualities, and vertues; in the colour, in the smell, and in
other Accidents.

Aristotle in the fourth Book of the Meteors and the first Chapter, treating of Putrefaction, he found the
same substances; and in the second Chapter next following, where he that is curious may read it. And also
by the Doctrine of Galen, and of Aristotle, divers substances are
attributed to every of the mixt under one and the same forme and
quantity; which is very conformable to reason, if we consider, that
every Aliment be it never so simple, begets, and produceth in the
liver, foure humours, not onely differing in temper, but also in substance;
and begets more or lesse of that humour, according as that Aliment hath
more or fewer parts corresponding to the substance of that humour,
which is most ingendred.

And so in cold diseases, we give warme nourishment; and cold nourishment, in hot diseases.

From which evident examples, and many others, which we might produce to this purpose, we may gather,
that, when we grind and stir the Cacao, the divers parts, which
Nature hath given it, doe artificially, and intimately mixe themselves one
with another; and so the unctuous, warme, and moist parts, mingled
with the earthy (as we have said of the steele) represses, and leaves
them not so binding, as they were before; but rather with a mediocritie,
more inclining to the warme, and moist temper of the Aire, then to
the cold and dry of the Earth; as it doth appeare when it is made
fit to drinke; that you scarce give it two turnes with the Molinet
when there riseth a fatty scumme: by which you may see how much it
partaketh of the Oylie part.

From which doctrine I gather, that the Author of Marchena, was in an errour, who, writing of Chocolate,
saith that it causeth Opilations, because Cacao is astringent; as if that astriction were not corrected,
by the intimate mixing of one part with another, by meanes of the grinding,
as is said before. Besides, it having so many ingredients, which are
naturally hot, it must of necessity have this effect; that is to say,
to open, attenuate, and not to binde; and, indeed, there is no cause
of bringing more examples, or producing more reasons, for this truth,
then that which we see in the Cacao it self: which, if it be not
stirred, and compounded, as aforesaid, to make the Chocolate.

But eating of it, as it is in the fruite, as the Criollas eate it in the Indies, it doth notably obstruct, and
cause stoppings; for no other cause but this, that the divers substances which it containes,
are not perfectly mingled by the mastication onely, but require the artificiall mixture, which we have spoken
of before.

Besides, our Adversary should have considered, and called to his memory,
the first rudiments of Philosophy, that à dicto secundum quid, ad
dictum simpliciter, non valet consequentia; As it is not enough to
say, the Black-a-Moore is white, because his teeth are white; for
he may be blacke, though he hath white teeth; and so it is not enough
to say, that the Cacao is stopping; and therefore the Confection,
which is made of it, is also stopping.

The Tree, which beares this fruit, is so delicate; and the earth, where
it growes, is so extreme hot, that to keepe the tree from being consumed
by the Sun, they first plant other trees; and when they are growne up
to a good height, then they plant the Cacao trees; that when it first shewes
it selfe above the ground, those trees which are already growne, may
shelter it from the Sunne; and the fruit doth not grow naked, but
ten or twelve of them are in one Gorde or Cod, which is of the bignesse
of a greate black Figge, or bigger, and of the same forme, and colour.

There
are two sorts of Cacao; the one is common, which is of a gray colour,
inclining towards red; the other is broader and bigger, which they
call Patlaxte, and this is white, and more drying; whereby it causeth
watchfulnesse, and drives away sleepe, and therefore it is not so
usefull, as the ordinary. This shall suffice to be said of the Cacao.

And
as for the rest of the ingredients, which make our Chocolaticall Confection,
there is notable variety; because some doe put into it black Pepper,
and also Tauasco[A]; which is not proper, because it is so hot and
dry; but onely for one, who hath a very cold Liver.

And of this opinion, was a certaine Doctor of the University of Mexico, of whom a
Religious man of good credit told me, that he finding the ordinary round
Pepper was not fit to bring his purpose about, and to the end, he might
discover, whether the long red pepper were more proper, he made triall
upon the liver of a Sheepe; and putting the ordinary pepper on one
side, and the red pepper[B] on the other, after 24 hours, the part, where
the ordinary pepper lay, was dryed up; and the other part continued
moist, as if nothing had bin thrown upon it.

[A] A red roote like madder.

The Receipt of him who wrote at Marchena, is this: Of Cacaos, 700; of white Sugar, one pound and a halfe;
Cinnamon, 2. ounces; of long red pepper, 14. of Cloves, halfe an ounce:
Three Cods of the Logwood or Campeche tree; or in steade of that,
the weight of 2. Reals, or a shilling of Anniseeds; as much of Agiote,
as will give the colour, which is about the quantity of a Hasell-nut.
Some put in Almons, kernells of Nuts, and Orenge-flower-water.

Concerning
this Receipt I shall first say, This shooe will not fit every foote;
but for those, who have diseases, or are inclining to be infirme,
you may either adde, or take away, according to the necessity, and
temperature of every one: and I hold it not amisse, that Sugar be
put into it, when it is drunke, so that it be according to the quantity
I shall hereafter set downe. And sometimes they make Tablets of the
Sugar, and the Chocolate together: which they doe onely to please
the Pallats, as the Dames of Mexico doe use it; and they are there
sold in shops, and are confected and eaten like other sweet-meats. Three of the black
dots along the gently rising slope far ahead had leaped from their mounts and were slowly crawling
forward, while one of them, his horse turned adrift and contentedly nibbling at the buffalo
grass, was surely signaling that there was mischief ahead.

In an instant the lieutenant was galloping out to the front, cautioning the driver to come
on slowly. Presently he overhauled the sergeant and bade him follow, and together the four
men darted on up the gradual incline until within ten yards of where the leaders' horses were
placidly grazing. There they threw themselves from saddle; one of the men took the reins of
the four horses while Dean and the other two, unslinging carbine and crouching low, went hurriedly
on up the slope until they came within a few yards of the nearest scout.

"Indians!" he called to them as soon as they were within earshot. "But they don't seem to be
on lookout for us at all. They're fooling with some buffalo over here."

Crawling to the crest, leaving his hat behind, Dean peered over into the swale beyond and this
was what he saw.

Half a mile away to the east the low, concave sweep of the prairie was cut by the jagged banks
and curves of a watercourse which drained the melting snows in earlier spring. Along the further
bank a dozen buffalo were placidly grazing, unconscious of the fact that in the shallow, dry
ravine itself half a dozen young Indians--Sioux, apparently--were lurking, awaiting the nearer
coming of the herd, whose leaders, at least, were gradually approaching the edge. Away down
to the northeast, toward the distant Powder River, the shallow stream bed trended, and, following
the pointing finger of the scout who crawled to his side, Dean gazed and saw a confused mass
of slowly moving objects, betrayed for miles by the light cloud of dust that hovered over them,
covering many an acre of the prairie, stretching far away down the vale. Even before he could
unsling his field glass and gaze, his plains-craft told him what was slowly, steadily approaching,
as though to cross his front--an Indian village, a big one, on the move to the mountains, bound
perhaps for the famous racecourse of the Sioux, a grand amphitheater in the southern hills.

And even as they gazed, two tiny jets of flame and smoke shot from the ravine edge there below
them, and before the dull reports could reach their ears the foremost bison dropped on his
knees and then rolled over on the sod; and then came the order, at sound of which, back among
the halted troopers, every carbine leaped from its socket.

CHAPTER III.

Down along the building railway in the valley or the Platte there had been two years of frequent
encounter with small bands of Indians. Down along the Smoky Hill, in Kansas, the Cheyennes
were ever giving trouble. Even around Laramie and Frayne, on the North Platte, settlers and
soldiers had been murdered, as well as one or two officers, caught alone out hunting, and the
Indians were, of course, the perpetrators. Nevertheless, it had been the policy of the leaders
of the Northern Sioux to avoid any meeting in force and to deny the complicity of their people
in the crimes committed. Supply trains to Reno, Kearney and C. F. Smith, the Big Horn posts
of the Bozeman Trail went to and fro with guards of only moderate size. Officers had taken
their wives and children to these far-away stations. The stockades were filled with soldiers'
families. Big bands of Indians roamed the lovely valleys of the Piney, the Tongue, and Rosebud,
near at hand, and rode into full view of the wary sentries at the stockades, yet made no hostile
demonstration. Officers and men went far up the rocky cañons of the hills in search of fish
or game, and came back unmolested. Escorts reported that they sometimes marched all day long
side by side with hunting bands of Sioux, a mile away; and often little parties, squaws and
boys and young men, would ride confidently over and beg for sugar, coffee, hardtack--anything,
and ride off with their plunder in the best of spirits and with all apparent good feeling.
And yet the great war-chief of the Brulés--Sintogaliska--Spotted Tail, the white man's friend,
gave solemn warning not to trust the Ogallallas. "Red Cloud's heart is bad," he said. "He and
his people are moving from the reservations to the mountains. They mean trouble." Old traders
like Folsom heard and heeded, and Folsom himself hastened to Fort Frayne the very week that
Burleigh and his escort left for Warrior Gap. Visiting at the ranch of his son in a beautiful
nook behind the Medicine Bow Mountains, the veteran trader heard tidings from an Indian brave
that filled him with apprehension, and he hurried to the fort.

"Is it true," he asked, "that the government means to establish a post at Warrior Gap? Is it
true that Major Burleigh has gone thither?" And when told that it was and that only Captain
Brooks's troop had gone as escort, Folsom's agitation was extreme. "Colonel," said he, to the
post commander, "solemnly I have tried to warn the general of the danger of that move. I have
told him that all the northern tribes are leaguing now, that they have determined to keep to
themselves the Big Horn country and the valleys to the north. It will take five thousand men
to hold those three posts against the Sioux, and you've barely got five hundred. I warn you
that any attempt to start another post up there will bring Red Cloud and all his people to
the spot. Their scouts are watching like hawks even now. Iron Spear came to me at my son's
ranch last night and told me not ten warriors were left at the reservation. They are all gone,
and the war dances are on in every valley from the Black Hills to the Powder. For heaven's
sake send half your garrison up to Reno after Brooks. You are safe here. They won't molest
you south of the Platte, at least not now. All they ask is that you build no more forts in
the Big Horn."

But the colonel could not act without authority. Telegraph there was none then. What Folsom
said was of sufficient importance to warrant his hurrying off a courier to Laramie, fully one
hundred miles southeast, and ordering a troop to scout across the wild wastes to the north,
while Folsom himself, unable to master his anxiety, decided to accompany the command sent out
toward Cantonment Reno. He long had had influence with the Ogallallas. Even now Red Cloud might
listen if he could but find him. The matter was of such urgency he could not refrain. And so
with the gray troop of the cavalry, setting forth within an hour of his coming, rode the old
trader whom the Indians had so long sworn by, and he started none too soon.

Reno was some ninety miles away, and not until late the next evening did the grays reach the
lonely post. Not a sign of hostile Indian had been seen or heard, said the officer in command.
Small bands of hunters were out toward Pumpkin Butte two days before.--Yes, Ogallallas--and
a scouting party, working down the valley of the Powder, had met no band at all, though trails
were numerous. They were now patroling toward the Big Horn. Perhaps there'd be a courier in
to-morrow. Better get a good night's rest meantime, he said. But all the same he doubled his
guards and ordered extra vigilance, for all men knew John Folsom, and when Folsom was anxious
on the Indian question it was time to look alive. Daybreak came without a sign, but Folsom
could not rest. The grays had no authority to go beyond Reno, but such was his anxiety that
it was decided to hold the troop at the cantonment for a day or two. Meantime, despite his
years, Folsom decided to push on for the Gap. All efforts to dissuade him were in vain. With
him rode Baptiste, a half-breed Frenchman whose mother was an Ogallalla squaw, and "Bat" had
served him many a year. Their canteens were filled, their saddle-pouches packed. They led along
an extra mule, with camp equipage, and shook hands gravely with the officers ere they rode
away. "All depends," said Folsom, "on whether Red Cloud is hereabouts in person. If he is and
I can get his ear I can probably stave off trouble long enough to get those people at the Gap
back to Kearney, or over here. They're goners if they attempt to stay there and build that
post. If you don't have word from us in two days, send for all the troops the government can
raise. It will take every mother's son they've got to whip the Sioux when once they're leagued
together."

"But our men have the new breech-loaders now, Mr. Folsom," said the officers. "The Indians
have only old percussion-cap rifles, and not too many of them."

"But there are twenty warriors to every soldier," was the answer, "and all are fighting men."

They watched the pair until they disappeared far to the west. All day long the lookouts searched
the horizon. All that night the sentries listened for hoof-beats on the Bozeman road, but only
the weird chorus of the coyotes woke the echoes of the dark prairie. Dawn of the second day
came, and, unable to bear suspense, the major sent a little party, mounted on their fleetest
horses, to scour the prairies at least halfway to the foothills of the Big Horn, and just at
nightfall they came back--three at least--galloping like mad, their mounts a mass of foam.
Folsom's dread was well founded. Red Cloud, with heaven only knew how many warriors, had camped
on Crazy Woman's Fork within the past three days, and gone on up stream. He might have met
and fought the troops sent out three days before. He must have met the troops dispatched to
Warrior Gap.

And this last, at least, he had done. For a few seconds after the fall of the buffalo bull,
the watchers on the distant ridge lay still, except that Dean, turning slightly, called to
the orderly trumpeter, who had come trotting out after the troop commander, and was now halted
and afoot some twenty yards down the slope. "Go back, Bryan," he ordered. "Halt the ambulances.
Notify Captain Brooks that there are lots of Indians ahead, and have the sergeant deploy the
men at once." Then he turned back and with his field glass studied the party along the ravine.

"They can't have seen us, can they, lieutenant?" muttered the trooper nearest him.

But Dean's young face was grave and clouded. Certainly the Indians acted as though they were
totally unaware of the presence of troops, but the more he thought the more he knew that no
big body of Sioux would be traveling across country at so critical a time (country, too, that
was conquered as this was from their enemies, the Crows), without vigilant scouts afar out
on front and flank. The more he thought the more he knew that even as early as three o'clock
those keen-eyed fellows must have sighted his little column, conspicuous as it was because
of its wagons. Beyond question, he told himself, the chief of the band or village so steadily
approaching from the northeast had full information of their presence, and was coming confidently
ahead. What had he to fear? Even though the blood of settlers and soldiers might still be red
upon the hands of his braves, even though fresh scalps might be dangling at this moment from
their shields, what mattered it? Did he not know that the safeguard of the Indian Bureau spread
like the wing of a protecting angel over him and his people, forbidding troops to molest or
open fire unless they themselves were attacked? Did he not laugh in his ragged shirt sleeve
at the policy of the white fool who would permit the red enemy to ride boldly up to his soldiers,
count their numbers, inspect their array, satisfy himself as to their armament and readiness,
then calculate the chances, and, if he thought the force too strong, ride on his way with only
a significant gesture in parting insult? If, on the contrary, he found it weak then he could
turn loose his braves, surround, massacre and scalp, and swear before the commissioners sent
out to investigate next moon that he and his people knew nothing about the matter--nothing,
at least, that they could be induced to tell.

One moment more Dean watched and waited. Two of the Indians in the ravine were busily reloading
their rifles. Two others were aiming over the bank, for, with the strange stupidity of their
kind, the other buffalo, even when startled by the shot, had never sought safety in flight,
but were now sniffing the odor of blood on the tainted air, and slowly, wonderingly drawing
near the stricken leader as though to ask what ailed him. Obedient and docile, the Indian ponies
stood with drooping heads, hidden under the shelter of the steep banks. Nearer and nearer came
the big black animals, bulky, stupid, fatuous; the foremost lowered a huge head to sniff at
the blood oozing from the shoulder of the dying bull, then two more shots puffed out from the
ravine, the huge head tossed suddenly in air, and the ungainly brute started and staggered,
whirled about and darted a few yards away, then plunged on its knees, and the next moment,
startled at some sight the soldier watchers could not see, the black band was seized with sudden
panic, and darted like mad into the depths of the watercourse, disappeared one moment from
sight, then, suddenly reappearing, came laboring up the hither side, straight for the crest
on which they lay, a dozen black, bounding, panting beasts thundering over the ground, followed
by half a dozen darting Indian ponies, each with his lithe red rider scurrying in pursuit.

"Out of the way, men! Don't fire!" shouted Dean. And, scrambling back toward their horses,
the lieutenant and his men drew away from the front of the charging herd, invisible as yet
to the halted troop and to the occupants of the ambulance, whose eager heads could be seen
poked out at the side doors of the leading vehicle, as though watching for the cause of the
sudden halt.

And then a thing happened that at least one man saw and fortunately remembered later. Bryan,
the trumpeter, with jabbing heels and flapping arms, was tearing back toward the troop at the
moment at the top speed of his gray charger, already so near that he was shouting to the sergeant
in the lead. By this time, too, that veteran trooper, with the quick sense of duty that seemed
to inspire the war-time sergeant, had jumped his little column "front into line" to meet the
unseen danger; so that now, with carbines advanced, some thirty blue jackets were aligned in
the loose fighting order of the prairies in front of the foremost wagon. The sight of the distant
officer and men tumbling hurriedly back and to one side, out of the way presumably of some
swiftly-coming peril, acted like magic on the line. Carbines were quickly brought to ready,
the gun locks crackling in chorus as the horses pranced and snorted. But it had a varying effect
on the occupants of the leading wagon. The shout of "Indians" from Bryan's lips, the sight
of scurry on the ridge ahead brought the engineer and aide-de-camp springing out, rifle in
hand, to take their manly part in the coming fray. It should have brought Major Burleigh too,
but that appropriately named non-combatant never showed outside. An instant more and to the
sound of rising thunder, before the astonished eyes of the cavalry line there burst into view,
full tear for safety, the uncouth, yet marvelously swift-running leaders of the little herd.
The whole dozen came flying across the sky line and down the gentle slope, heading well around
to the left of the line of troopers, while sticking to their flanks like red nettles half a
dozen young warriors rode like the wind on their nimble ponies, cracking away with revolver
or rifle in savage joy in the glorious sport. Too much for Burleigh's nerve was the combination
of sounds, thunder of hoofs and sputter of shots, for when a cheer of sympathetic delight went
up from the soldier line at sight of the chase, and the young engineer sprang to the door of
the ambulance to help the major out, he found him a limp and ghastly heap, quivering with terror
in the bottom of the wagon, looking for all the world as if he were trying to crawl under the seat.

CHAPTER IV.

Away to the left of the little command tore the quarry and the chase. Out on the rolling prairie,
barely four hundred yards from where the ambulance and mules were backed into a tangle of traces
and whiffletrees and fear-stricken creatures, another buffalo had dropped in a heap; a swarthy
rider had tumbled off his pony, cut a slash or two with ever-ready knife, and then, throwing
a bead bedizened left leg over his eager little mount, had gone lashing away after his fellows,
not without a jeering slap at the baited soldiery. Then, in almost less time than it takes
to tell it, the pursued and pursuers had vanished from sight over a low ridge a mile to the
north. "Only a hunting party!" said one or two nervous recruits, with a gulp of relief. "Only
a hunting party," gasped Burleigh, as presently he heaved himself up from the floor, "and I
thought I'd never find that damned gun of mine. All this fuss for nothing!" he continued, his
lips still blue and quivering. "That green youngster up there in front hasn't learned the first
principles of plains-craft yet. Here, Brooks," he added loudly, "it's high time you were looking
after this sub of yours," and Brooks, despite his illness, was indeed working out of the back
door of his yellow trundle bed at the moment, and looking anxiously about. But the engineer
stood pale and quiet, coolly studying the flustered growler, and when Burleigh's shifting eyes
sought that young scientist's face, what he read there--and Burleigh was no fool--told him
he would be wise to change the tune. The aid had pushed out in front of the troop and was signaling
to Dean, once more in saddle and scanning through his glass the big band afar down the valley.

"Take my horse, sir," said the sergeant, dismounting, and the officer thanked him and rode
swiftly out to join the young commander at the front. Together they gazed and consulted and
still no signal came to resume the advance. Then the troopers saw the staff officer make a
broad sweep with his right arm to the south, and in a moment Dean's hat was uplifted and waved
well out in that direction. "Drop carbine," growled the sergeant. "By twos again. Incline to
the right. Damn the Sioux, I say! Have we got to circle five miles around their hunting ground
for fear of hurting their feelings. Come on. Jimmy," he added to the driver of the leading
wagon. Jimmy responded with vigorous language at the expense of his lead mules. The quartermaster
and engineer silently scrambled in; the ambulance started with a jerk and away went the party
off to the right of the trail, the wagons jolting a bit now over the uneven clumps of bunch grass.

But once well up at the summit of the low divide the command reined in for a look at the great
Indian cavalcade swarming in the northeastward valley, and covering its grassy surface still
a good mile away. Out from among the dingy mass came galloping half a dozen young braves, followed
by as many squaws. The former soon spread out over the billowy surface, some following the
direction of the chase, some bounding on south west ward as though confident of finding what
they sought the moment they reached the nearest ridge; some riding straight to the point where
lay the carcasses of the earliest victims of the hunt. Here in full view of the soldiery, but
vouchsafing them no glance nor greeting whatever, two young warriors reined in their lively
ponies and disdainfully turned their backs upon the spectators on the divide, while the squaws,
with shrill laugh and chatter, rolled from their saddles and began the drudgery of their lot--skinning
and cutting up the buffalos slaughtered by their lords.

"Don't you see," sneered Burleigh, "it's nothing but a village out for a hunt--nothing in God's
world to get stampeded about. We've had all this show of warlike preparation for nothing."
But he turned away again as he caught the steady look in the engineer's blue eyes, and shouted
to his more appreciative friend, the aide-de-camp: "Well, pardner, haven't we fooled away enough
time here, or have we got to wait the pleasure of people that never saw Indians before?"

Dean flushed crimson at the taunt. He well knew for whom it was meant. He was indignant enough
by this time to speak for himself, but the aide-de-camp saved him the trouble.

"I requested Mr. Dean to halt a few moments, Burleigh. It is necessary I should know what band
this is, and how many are out."

"Well, be quick about it," snapped the quartermaster, "I want to get to Reno before midnight,
and at this rate we won't make it in a week."

A sergeant who could speak a little Sioux came riding back to the camp, a grin on his sun-blistered
face. "Well, sergeant, what'd he say?" asked the staff officer.

"He said would I plaze to go to hell, sorr," was the prompt response.

"Won't he tell who they are?"

"He won't, sorr. He says we know widout askin', which is thrue, sorr. They're Ogallallas to
a man, barrin' the squaws and pappooses, wid ould Red Cloud himself."

"How'd you find out if they wouldn't talk?" asked the staff officer impatiently.

"'Twas the bucks wouldn't talk--except in swear wurruds. I wasted no time on them, sorr. I
gave the first squaw the last hardtack in me saddle-bags and tould her was it Machpealota,
and she said it was, and he was wid Box Karesha--that's ould Folsom--not six hour ago, an'
Folsom's gone back to the cantonment."

"Then the quicker we skip the better," were the aide-de-camp's words. "Get us to Reno fast
as you can, Dean. Strike for the road again as soon as we're well beyond their buffalo. Now
for it! There's something behind all this bogus hunt business, and Folsom knows what it is."

And every mile of the way, until thick darkness settled down over the prairie, there was something
behind the trooper cavalcade--several somethings--wary red men, young and wiry, who never let
themselves be seen, yet followed on over wave after wave of prairie to look to it that no man
went back from that column to carry the news of their presence to the little battalion left
in charge of the new post at Warrior Gap.

It was the dark of the moon, or, as the Indians say, "the nights the moon is sleeping in his
lodge," and by ten P. M. the skies were overcast. Only here and there a twinkling star was
visible, and only where some trooper struck a light for his pipe could a hand be seen in front
of the face. The ambulance mules that had kept their steady jog during the late afternoon and
the long gloaming that followed still seemed able to maintain the gait, and even the big, lumbering
wagon at the rear came briskly on under the tug of its triple span, but in the intense darkness
the guides at the head of the column kept losing the road, and the bumping of the wagons would
reveal the fact, and a halt would be ordered, men would dismount and go bending and crouching
and feeling their way over the almost barren surface, hunting among the sage brush for the
double furrow of the trail. Matches innumerable were consumed, and minutes of valuable time,
and the quartermaster waxed fretful and impatient, and swore that his mules could find their
way where the troopers couldn't, and finally, after the trail had been lost and found half
a dozen times, old Brooks was badgered into telling Dean to let the ambulance take the lead.
The driver shirked at once.

"There's no tellin' where we'll fetch up," said he. "Those mules can't see the trail if a man
can't. Take their harness off and turn 'em loose, an' I suppose they can find their way to
the post, but sure as you turn them loose when they've got somethin' on 'em, or behind 'em,
and the doggone cussedness of the creatures will prompt them to smash things."

But the quartermaster said he'd tried it with those very mules, between Emory and Medicine
Bow a dozen times, and he'd risk it. The driver could get off his seat if he wanted to, and
run alongside, but he'd stay where he was.

"Let me out, please," said the engineer, and jumped to the ground, and then the cavalcade pushed
on again. The driver, as ordered by an employer whom he dare not disobey, let the reins drop
on the mules' backs, the troopers falling behind, the yellow ambulance and the big baggage
wagon bringing up the rear.

Then, with a horseman on each side, the mules were persuaded to push on again, and then when
fairly started Burleigh called to the troopers to fall back, so that the mules should not,
as he expressed it, "be influenced." "Leave them to themselves and they can get along all right,"
said he, "but mix them up with the horses, and they want them to take all the responsibility."

And now the command was barely crawling. Brooks, heavy, languid with splitting headache, lay
in feverish torpor in his ambulance, asking only to be let alone. The engineer, a subaltern
as yet, felt that he had no right attempting to advise men like Burleigh, who proclaimed himself
an old campaigner. The aide-de-camp was getting both sleepy and impatient, but he, too, was
much the quartermaster's junior in rank. As for Dean, he had no volition whatever. "Escort
the party," were his orders, and that meant that he must govern the movements of his horses
and men by the wishes of the senior staff official. And so they jogged along perhaps twenty
minutes more, and then there was a sudden splutter and plunge and stumble ahead, a sharp pull
on the traces, a marvelously quick jerk back on the reins that threw the wheel team on their
haunches, and thereby saved the "outfit," for when men and matches were hurried to the front
the lead mules were discovered kicking and splashing in a mud hole. They were not only off
the road by a dozen yards, but over a bank two feet high.

And this last pound broke the back of Burleigh's obstinacy. It was nearly midnight anyway.
The best thing to be done was unhitch, unsaddle and bivouac until the gray light of dawn came
peering over the eastward prairie, which in that high latitude and "long-day" month would be
soon after three. Then they could push on to Reno.

Not until nearly eight o'clock in the morning, therefore, did they heave in sight of the low
belt of dingy green that told of the presence of a stream still long miles away; and here,
knowing himself to be out of danger, the major bade the weary escort march in at a walk while
he hurried on. In fifteen minutes the black-hooded wagon was twisting and turning over the
powdery road a good mile ahead, its dust rising high over the sage-covered desert, while the
other two, with the dust-begrimed troopers, jogged sturdily on. Loring, the young engineer,
had waved a cordial good-by to his old cadet acquaintance. "See you later, old man," he cried.
Stone, the aide-de-camp, nodded and said, "Take care of yourself," and Burleigh said nothing
at all. He was wondering what he could do to muzzle Loring in case that gifted young graduate
were moved to tell what the quartermaster actually did when he heard the rush and firing out
at the front on the road from Warrior Gap.

But when at last the black wagon bowled in at the stockaded quadrangle and discharged its occupants
at the hut of the major commanding, there were tidings of such import to greet them that Burleigh
turned yellow-white again at thought of the perils they had escaped.

"My God, man!" cried the post commander, as he came hurrying out to meet the party, "we've
been in a blue funk about you fellows for two whole days. Did you see any Indians?"

"See any Indians!" said Burleigh, rallying to the occasion as became a man who knew how to
grasp an opportunity. "We stood off the whole Sioux nation over toward Crazy Woman's Fork.
There were enough to cover the country, red and black, for a dozen miles. We sighted them yesterday
about four o'clock and there were enough around us to eat us alive, but we just threw out skirmish
lines and marched steadily ahead, so they thought best not to bother us. They're shy of our
breech loaders, damn 'em! That's all that kept them at respectful distance."

The major's face as he listened took on a puzzled, perturbed look. He did not wish to say anything
that might reflect on the opinions of so influential a man as the depot quartermaster at Gate
City, but it was plain that there was a train of thought rumbling through his mind that would
collide with Burleigh's column of events unless he were spared the need of answering questions.
"Let me tell you briefly what's happened," he said. "Red Cloud and his whole band are out on
the warpath. They killed two couriers, half-breeds, I sent out to find Thornton's troop that
was scouting the Dry Fork. The man we sent to find you and give you warning hasn't got back
at all. We've had double sentries for three days and nights. The only souls to get in from
the northwest since our fellows were run back last night are old Folsom and Baptiste. Folsom
had a talk with Red Cloud, and tried to induce him to turn back. He's beset with the idea that
the old villain is plotting a general massacre along the Big Horn. He looks like a ghost. He
says if we had five thousand soldiers up there there'd hardly be enough. You know the Sioux
have sworn by him for years, and he thought he could coax Red Cloud to keep away, but all the
old villain would promise was to hold his young men back ten days or so until Folsom could
get the general to order the Warrior Gap plan abandoned. If the troops are there Folsom says
it's all up with them. Red Cloud can rally all the Northern tribes, and it's only because of
Folsom's influence, at least I fancy so--that--that they didn't attack you."

"Where is Folsom?" growled Burleigh, as he shook the powdery cloud from his linen duster and
followed the major within his darkened door, while other officers hospitably led the aid and
engineer into the adjoining hut.

"Gone right on to Frayne. The old fellow will wear himself out, I'm afraid. He says he must
get in telegraphic communication with Omaha before he's four days older. My heaven, man, it
was a narrow squeak you had! It's God's mercy Folsom saw Red Cloud before he saw you."

"Oh, pshaw!" said the quartermaster, turning over a little packet of letters awaiting him in
the commanding officer's sanctum. "We could have given a good account of ourselves, I reckon.
Brooks is down with fever, and young Dean got rattled, or something like it. He's new at the
business and easily scared, you know; so I practically had to take command. They'll be along
in an hour or so, and--a word in your ear. If Brooks has to remain on sick report you'd better
put somebody in command of that troop that's had--er--er--experience."

The post commander looked genuinely troubled. "Why, Burleigh, we've all taken quite a shine
to Dean. I know the officers in his regiment think a heap of him; the seniors do, at least."

But Burleigh, with big eyes, was glaring at a letter he had selected, opened, and was hurriedly
reading. His face was yellowing again, under the blister of sun and alkali.

"What's amiss?" queried his friend. "Nothing wrong, I hope. Why, Burleigh, man! Here, let me
help you!" he cried in alarm, for the quartermaster was sinking into a chair.

"You can help me!" he gasped. "Get me fresh mules and escort. My God! I must start for Frayne
at once. Some whisky, please." And the letter dropped from his trembling hands and lay there
unnoticed on the floor.

CHAPTER V.

Mid June had come, and there was the very devil to pay--so said the scouts and soldiers up
along the Big Horn. But scouts and soldiers were far removed from the States and cities where
news was manufactured, and those were days in which our Indian outbreaks were described in
the press long after, instead of before, their occurrence. Such couriers as had got through
to Frayne brought dispatches from the far-isolated posts along that beautiful range, insisting
that the Sioux were swarming in every valley. Such dispatches, when wired to Washington and
"referred" to the Department of the Interior and re-referred to the head of the Indian Bureau,
were scoffed at as sensational.

"Our agents report the Indians peaceably assembled at their reservations. None are missing
at the weekly distribution of supplies except those who are properly accounted for as out on
their annual hunt." "The officers," said the papers, "seem to see red Indians in every bush,"
and unpleasant things were hinted at the officers as a consequence.

Indians there certainly were in other sections, and they were unquestionably "raising the devil"
along the Smoky Hill and the Southern Plains, and there the Interior Department insisted that
troops in strong force should be sent. So, too, along the line of the Union Pacific. Officials
were still nervous. Troops of cavalry camped at intervals of forty miles along the line between
Kearney and Julesburg, and even beyond. At Washington and the great cities of the East, therefore,
there was no anxiety as to the possible fate of those little garrisons, with their helpless
charge of women and children away up in the heart of the Sioux country. But at Laramie and
Frayne and Emory, the nearest frontier posts; at Cheyenne, Omaha and Gate City the anxiety
was great. When John Folsom said the Indians meant a war of extermination people west of the
Missouri said: "Withdraw those garrisons while there is yet time or else send five thousand
troops to help them." But people east of the Missouri said: "Who the devil is John Folsom?
What does he know about it? Here's what the Indian agents say, and that's enough," and people
east of the Missouri being vastly in the majority, neither were the garrisons relieved nor
the reinforcements sent. What was worse, John Folsom's urgent advice that they discontinue
at once all work at Warrior Gap and send the troops and laborers back to Reno was pooh-poohed.

"The contracts have been let and signed. The material is all on its way. We can't hack out
now," said the officials. "Send runners to Red Cloud and get him in for a talk. Promise him
lots of presents. Yes, if he must have them, tell him he shall have breech-loaders and copper
cartridges, like the soldiers--to shoot buffalo with, of course. Promise him pretty much anything
to be good and keep his hands off a little longer till we get that fort and the new agency
buildings finished, and then let him do what he likes."

Such were the instructions given the commissioners and interpreters hurried through Gate City
and Frayne, and on up to Reno just within the limit fixed by Folsom. Red Cloud and his chiefs
came in accordingly, arrayed in pomp, paint and finery; shook hands grimly with the representatives
of the Great Father, critically scanned the proffered gifts, disdainfully rejected the muzzle-loading
rifles and old dragoon horse-pistols heaped before him. "Got heap better," was his comment,
and nothing but brand new breech-loaders would serve his purpose. Promise them and he'd see
what could be done to restrain his young men. But they were "pretty mad," he said, and couldn't
be relied upon to keep the peace unless sure of getting better arms and ammunition to help
them break it next time. It was only temporizing. It was only encouraging the veteran war-chief
in his visions of power and control. The commissioners came back beaming, "Everything satisfactorily
arranged. Red Cloud and his people are only out for a big hunt." But officers whose wives and
children prayed fearfully at night within the puny wooden stockades, and listened trembling
to the howls and tom-toms of the dancing Indians around the council fires in the neighboring
valleys, wished to heaven they had left those dear ones in safety at their Eastern homes--wished
to heaven they could send them thither now, but well knew that it was too late. Only as single
spies, riding by night, hiding by day, were couriers able to get through from the Big Horn
to the Platte. Of scouts and soldiers sent at different times since the middle of May, seven
were missing, and never, except through vague boastings of the Indians, were heard of again.

"It is a treacherous truce, I tell you," said Folsom, with grave, anxious face, to the colonel
commanding Fort Emory. "I have known Red Cloud twenty years. He's only waiting a few weeks
to see if the government will be fool enough to send them breech-loaders. If it does, he'll
be all the better able to fight a little later on. If it doesn't he will make it his casus belli."

And the veteran colonel listened, looked grave, and said he had done his utmost to convince
his superiors. He could do no more.

It was nearly three hundred miles by the winding mountain road from Gate City to Warrior Gap.
Over hill and dale and mountain pass the road ran to Frayne, thence, fording the North Platte,
the wagon trains, heavily guarded, had to drag over miles of dreary desert, over shadeless
slopes and divides to the dry wash of the Powder, and by roads deep in alkali dust and sage
brush to Cantonment Reno, where far to the west the grand range loomed up against the sky--another
long day's march away to the nearest foothills, to the nearest drinkable water, and then, forty
miles further still, in the heart of the grand pine-covered heights, was the rock-bound gateway
to a lovely park region within, called by the Sioux some wild combination of almost unpronounceable
syllables, which, freely translated, gave us Warrior Gap, and there at last accounts, strengthened
by detachments from Frayne and Reno, the little command of fort builders worked away, ax in
hand, rifle at hand, subjected every hour to alarm from the vedettes and pickets posted thickly
all about them, pickets who were sometimes found stone dead at their posts, transfixed with
arrows, scalped and mutilated, and yet not once had Indians in any force been seen by officers
or man about the spot since the day Red Cloud's whole array passed Brooks's troop on the Reno
trail, peaceably hunting buffalo. "An' divil a sowl in in the outfit," said old Sergeant Shaughnessy,
"that hadn't his tongue in his cheek."

For three months that hard-worked troop had been afield, and the time had passed and gone when
its young first lieutenant had hoped for a leave to go home and see the mother and Jess. His
captain was still ailing and unfit for duty in saddle. He could not and would not ask for leave
at such a time, and yet at the very moment when he was most earnestly and faithfully doing
his whole duty at the front, slander was busy with his name long miles at the rear.

Something was amiss with Burleigh, said his cronies at Gate City. He had come hurrying back
from the hills, had spent a day in his office and not a cent at the club, had taken the night
express unbeknown to anybody but his chief clerk, and gone hurrying eastward. It was a time
when his services were needed at the depot, too. Supplies, stores, all manner of material were
being freighted from Gate City over the range to the Platte and beyond, yet he had wired for
authority to hasten to Chicago on urgent personal affairs, got it and disappeared. A young
regimental quartermaster was ordered in from Emory to take charge of shipments and sign invoices
during Burleigh's temporary absence, and the only other officer whom Burleigh had seen and
talked with before his start was the venerable post commander. One after another the few cavalry
troops (companies) on duty at Emory had been sent afield until now only one was left, and three
days after Burleigh started there came a dispatch from department headquarters directing the
sending of that one to Frayne at once. Captain Brooks's troop, owing to the continued illness
of its commander, would be temporarily withdrawn and sent back to Emory to replace it.

Marshall Dean did not know whether to be glad or sorry. Soldier from top to toe, he was keenly
enjoying the command of his troop. He gloried in mountain scouting, and was in his element
when astride a spirited horse. Then, too, the air was throbbing with rumors of Indian depredations
along the northward trails, and everything pointed to serious outbreak any moment, and when
it came he longed to be on hand to take his share and win his name, for with such a troop his
chances were better for honors and distinctions than those of any youngster he knew. Therefore
he longed to keep afield. On the other hand the visit paid by Jessie's school friend, little
"Pappoose" Folsom, was to be returned in kind. John Folsom had begged and their mother had
consented that after a week at home Jess should accompany her beloved friend on a visit to
her far western home. They would be escorted as far as Omaha, and there Folsom himself would
meet them. His handsome house was ready, and, so said friends who had been invited to the housewarming,
particularly well stocked as to larder and cellar. There was just one thing on which Gate City
gossips were enabled to dilate that was not entirely satisfactory to Folsom's friends, and
that was the new presiding goddess of the establishment.

"What on earth does John Folsom want of a housekeeper?" asked the helpmates of his friends
at Fort Emory, and in the bustling, busy town. "Why don't he marry again?" queried those who
would gladly have seen some unprovided sister, niece or daughter thus cozily disposed of. It
was years since Elinor's mother's death, and yet John Folsom seemed to mourn her as fondly
as ever, and except in mid-winter, barely a month went by in which he did not make his pilgrimage
to her never-neglected grave. Yet, despite his vigorous years in saddle, sunshine or storm,
and his thorough love for outdoor life, Folsom, now well over fifty, could no longer so lightly
bear the hard life of the field. He was amazed to see how his sleepless dash to head off Red
Cloud, and his days and nights of gallop back, had told upon him. Women at Fort Emory who looked
with approving eyes on his ruddy face and trim, erect figure, all so eloquent of health, and
who possibly contemplated, too, his solid bank account, and that fast-building house, the finest
in Gate City, had been telling him all winter long he ought to have a companion--an elder guide
for Miss Elinor on her return; he ought to have some one to preside at his table; and honest
John had promptly answered: "Why, Nell will do all that," which necessitated their hinting
that although Miss Folsom would be a young lady in years, she was only a child in experience,
and would be much the better for some one who could take a mother's place. "No one could do
that," said John, with sudden swimming of his eyes, and that put as sudden a stop to their
schemings, for the time at least, but only for the time. Taking counsel together, and thinking
how lovely it would be now if Mr. Folsom would only see how much there was in this unmarried
damsel, or that widowed dame, the coterie at Emory again returned to the subject, until John,
in his perplexity, got the idea that propriety demanded that he should have a housekeeper against
his daughter's coming, and then he did go and do, in his masculine stupidity, just exactly
what they couldn't have had him do for worlds--invite a woman, of whom none of their number
had ever heard, to come from Omaha and take the domestic management of his hearth and home.
All he knew of her was what he heard there. She was the widow of a volunteer officer who had
died of disease contracted during the war. She was childless, almost destitute, accomplished,
and so devoted to her church duties. She was interesting and refined, and highly educated.
He heard the eulogiums pronounced by the good priest and some of his flock, and Mrs. Fletcher,
a substantial person of some forty years at least, was duly installed.

Fort Emory was filled with women folk and consternation--most of the men being afield. The
seething question of the hour was whether they should call on her, whether she was to be received
at the fort, whether she was to be acknowledged and recognized at all, and then came, mirabile
dictu, a great government official from Washington to inspect the Union Pacific and make speeches
at various points along the road, and Mrs. Fletcher, mind you, walked to church the very next
Sunday on the Honorable Secretary's arm, sat by his side when he drove out to hear the band
at Emory, and received with him on the colonel's veranda, and that settled it. Received and
acknowledged and visited she had to be. She might well prove a woman worth knowing.

Within a fortnight she had made the new homestead blossom like the rose. Within a month everything
was in perfect order for the reception of Elinor and her school friend--a busy, anxious month,
in which Folsom was flitting to and fro to Reno and Frayne, as we have seen; to Hal's ranch
in the Medicine Bow, to Rawhide and Laramie, and the reservations in Northwestern Nebraska;
and it so happened that he was away the night Major Burleigh, on his way to the depot, dropped
in to inquire if he could see Mr. Folsom a moment on important business. The servant said he
was not in town--had gone, she thought, to Omaha. She would inquire of Mrs. Fletcher, and meantime
would the major step inside? Step inside, and stand wonderingly at the threshold of the pretty
parlor he did; and then there was a rustle of silken skirts on the floor above, and, as he
turned to listen, his haggard, careworn face took on a look something like that which overspread
it the night he got the letter at Reno--something that told of bewilderment and perplexity
as a quiet, modulated voice told the servant to tell the gentleman Mr. Folsom might not return
for several days. Burleigh had no excuse to linger, none to ask to hear that voice again; yet
as he slowly descended the steps its accents were still strangely ringing in his ears. Where
on earth had he heard that voice before?

CHAPTER VI.

The quartermaster's depot at Gate City was little more than a big corral, with a double row
of low, wooden sheds for the storing of clothing, camp and garrison equipage. There was a blacksmith
and wagon repair shop, and a brick office building. Some cottage quarters for the officer in
charge and his clerks, corral master, etc., stood close at hand, while most of the employees
lived in town outside the gates. A single-track spur connected the depot with the main line
of the Union Pacific only five hundred yards away, and the command at Fort Emory, on the bluff
above the rapid stream, furnished, much to its disgust, the necessary guard. A much bigger
"plant" was in contemplation near a larger post and town on the east side of the great divide,
and neither Fort Emory nor its charge--the quartermaster's depot--was considered worth keeping
in repair, except such as could be accomplished "by the labor of troops," which was why, when
he wasn't fighting Indians, the frontier soldier of that day was mainly occupied in doing the
odd jobs of a day laborer, without the recompense of one, or his privilege of quitting if he
didn't like the job. That he should know little of drill and less of parade was, therefore,
not to be wondered at.

But what he didn't know about guard duty was hardly worth knowing. He had prisoners and property
of every conceivable kind--Indians, horse thieves, thugs and deserters, magazines and medicines,
mules and munitions of war. Everything had to be guarded. The fort lay a mile to the west of
and two hundred feet higher than the railway hotel in the heart of the town. It looked down
upon the self-styled city, and most of its womenkind did the same on the citizens, who were,
it must be owned, a rather mixed lot. The sudden discovery of gold in the neighboring foothills,
the fact that it promised to be the site of the division car shops and roundhouse, that the
trails to the Upper Platte, the Sweetwater, the Park country to the south, and the rich game
regions of the Medicine Bow all centered there, and that stages left no less than twice a week
for some of those points, and the whole land was alive with explorers for a hundred miles around--all
had tended to give Gate City a remarkable boom. Cheyenne and Laramie, thriving frontier towns
with coroners' offices in full blast from one week's end to the other, and a double force on
duty Sundays, confessed to and exhibited pardonable jealousy. Yet there was wisdom in the warning
of an old friend and fellow frontiersman, who said to Folsom, "You are throwing yourself and
your money away, John. There's nothing in those gold stones, there's nothing in that yawp about
the machine shops; all those yarns were started by U. P. fellows with corner lots to sell.
The bottom will drop out of that place inside of a year and leave you stranded."

All the same had Folsom bought big blocks and built his home there. It was the nearest town
of promise to Hal Folsom's wild but beautiful home in the hills, and, almost as he loved Nell,
his bonny daughter, did the old trader love his stalwart son. Born a wild Westerner, reared
among the Sioux with only Indians or army boys for playmates, and precious little choice in
point of savagery between them, Hal had grown up a natural horseman with a love for and knowledge
of the animal that is accorded to few. His ambition in life was to own a stock farm. All the
education he had in the world he owed to the kindness of loving-hearted army women at Laramie,
women who befriended him when well-nigh broken-hearted by his mother's death. Early he had
pitched his tent on the very spot for a ranchman's homestead, early he had fallen in love with
an army girl, who married the strapping frontiersman and was now the proud mistress of the
new and promising stock farm nestling in the valley of the Laramie, a devoted wife and mother.
The weekly stage to the railway was the event of their placid days except when some of the
officers and ladies would come from either of the neighboring posts and spend a week with her
and Hal. From being a delicate, consumptive child, Mrs. Hal had developed into a buxom woman
with exuberant health and spirits. Life to her might have some little monotony, but few cares;
many placid joys, but only one great dread--Indians. John Folsom, her fond father-in-law, was
a man all Indians trusted and most of them loved. Hal Folsom, her husband, had many a trusted
and devoted friend among the Sioux, but he had also enemies, and Indian enmity, like Indian
love, dies hard. As boy he had sometimes triumphed in games and sports over the champions of
the villages. As youth he had more than once found favor in the dark eyes that looked coldly
on fiercer, fonder claimants, and one girl of the Ogallallas had turned from her kith and kin,
spurned more than one red lover to seek the young trader when he left the reservation to build
his own nest in the Medicine Bow, and they told a story as pathetic as that of the favorite
daughter of old Sintogaliska, chief of the Brulé Sioux, who pined and died at Laramie when
she heard that the soldier she loved had come back from the far East with a pale-faced bride.
There were red men of the Ogallallas to whom the name of Hal Folsom was a taunt and insult
to this day, men whom his father had vainly sought to appease, and they were Burning Star,
the lover, and two younger braves, the brothers of the girl they swore that Hal had lured away.

South of the Platte, as it rolled past Frayne and Laramie, those Indians were bound by treaty
not to go. North of the Platte Hal Folsom was warned never again to venture. These were stories
which were well known to the parents of the girl he wooed and won, but which probably were
not fully explained to her. Now, even behind the curtain of that sheltering river, with its
flanking forts, even behind the barrier of the mountains of the Medicine Bow, she often woke
at night and clutched her baby to her breast when the yelping of the coyotes came rising on
the wind. There was no woman in Wyoming to whom war with Red Cloud's people bore such dread
possibility as to Hal Folsom's wife.

And so when Marshall Dean came riding in one glad June morning, bronzed, and tanned, and buoyant,
and tossed his reins to the orderly who trotted at his heels, while the troop dismounted and
watered at the stream, Mrs. Folsom's heart was gladdened by his confident and joyous bearing.
Twice, thrice he had seen Red Cloud and all his braves, and there was nothing, said he, to
worry about. "Ugly, of course they are; got some imaginary grievances and talk big about the
warpath. Why, what show would those fellows have with their old squirrel rifles and gas-pipe
Springfields against our new breech-loaders? They know it as well as we do. It's all a bluff,
Mrs. Folsom. You mark my words," said he, and really the boy believed it. Frequent contact
in the field with the red warriors inspires one with little respect for their skill or prowess
until that contact becomes hostile, then it's time to keep every sense on guard and leave no
point uncovered.

"But what if the Indian Bureau should let them have breech-loaders?" she anxiously asked. "You
know that is Red Cloud's demand."

"Oh," said Dean, with confidence born of inexperience in the Bureau ways, "they couldn't be
such fools. Besides, if they do," he added hopefully, "you'll see my troop come trotting back
full tilt. Now, I'm counting on a good time at Emory, and on bringing your sister and mine
up here to see you."

"It will be just lovely," said Mrs. Hal, with a woman's natural but unspoken comparison between
the simplicity of her ranch toilet and the probable elegancies of the young ladies' Eastern
costumes. "They'll find us very primitive up here in the mountains, I'm afraid; but if they
like scenery and horseback riding and fishing there's nothing like it."

"Oh, they're coming sure. Jessie's letters tell me that's one of the big treats Mr. Folsom
has promised them. Just think, they should be along this week, and I shall be stationed so
near them at Emory--of all places in the world."

"How long is it since you have seen Elinor--'Pappoose,' as your sister calls her," asked Mrs.
Hal, following the train of womanly thought then drifting through her head, as she set before
her visitor a brimming goblet of buttermilk.

"Two years. She was at the Point a day or two the summer of our graduation," he answered carelessly.
"A real little Indian girl she was, too, so dark and shy and silent, yet I heard Professor
M----'s daughters and others speak of her later; she pleased them so much, and Jessie thinks
there's no girl like her."

"And you haven't seen her since--not even her picture?" asked Mrs. Hal, rising from her easy-chair.
"Just let me show you the one she sent Hal last week. I think there's a surprise in store for
you, young man," was her mental addition, as she tripped within doors.

The nurse girl, a half-breed, one of the numerous progeny of the French trappers and explorers
who had married among the Sioux, was hushing the burly little son and heir to sleep in his
Indian cradle, crooning some song about the fireflies and and Heecha, the big-eyed owl, and
the mother stooped to press her lips upon the rounded cheek and to flick away a tear-drop,
for Hal 2d had roared lustily when ordered to his noonday nap. Away to the northward the heavily
wooded heights seemed tipped by fleecy, summer clouds, and off to the northeast Laramie Peak
thrust his dense crop of pine and scrub oak above the mass of snowy vapor that floated lazily
across that grim-visaged southward scarp. The drowsy hum of insects, the plash of cool, running
waters fell softly on the ear. Under the shade of willow and cottonwood cattle and horses were
lazily switching at the swarm of gnats and flies or dozing through the heated hours of the
day. Out on the level flat beyond the corral the troopers had unsaddled, and the chargers,
many of them stopping to roll in equine ecstasy upon the turf, were being driven out in one
big herd to graze. Without and within the ranch everything seemed to speak of peace and security.
The master rode the range long miles away in search of straying cattle, leaving his loved ones
without thought of danger. The solemn treaty that bound the Sioux to keep to the north of the
Platte stood sole sentinel over his vine and fig tree. True there had been one or two instances
of depredation, but they could be fastened on no particular band, and all the chiefs, even
defiant Red Cloud, and insolent, swaggering Little Big Man, denied all knowledge of the perpetrators.
Spotted Tail, it was known, would severely punish any of his people who transgressed, but he
could do nothing with the Ogallallas. Now they were not two hundred miles away to the north,
their ranks swollen by accessions from all the disaffected villages and turbulent young braves
of the swarming bands along the Missouri and Yellowstone, and if their demands were resisted
by the government, or worse, if they were permitted to have breech-loaders or magazine rifles,
then just coming into use, no shadow of doubt remained that war to the knife would follow.
Then how long would it be before they came charging down across the Platte, east or west of
Frayne, and raiding those new ranches in the Laramie Valley?

Reassuring as he meant his words to be, Marshall Dean himself looked anxiously about at the
unprotected walls. Not even the customary "dugout" or underground refuge seemed to have been
prepared. Almost every homestead, big or little, of those days, had its tunnel from the cellar
to a dugout near at hand, stocked with provisions and water and provided with loopholes commanding
the neighborhood, and herein the besieged could take refuge and stand off the Indians until
help should come from the nearest frontier fort. "The name of Folsom is our safeguard," said
Mrs. Hal, in her happy honeymoon days, but that was before the mother told her of the threats
of Burning Star or the story of the Ogallalla girl he vainly loved. "All that happened so long
ago," she murmured, when at last the tale was told. But Hal should have known, if she did not,
that, even when it seems to sleep, Indian vengeance is but gaining force and fury.

Presently Mrs. Hall came tripping forth again, a little carte de visite in her hand, a smile
of no little significance on her lips. "Now, Mr. Dean, will you tell me what you think of that
for a pappoose?"

And with wonderment in his eyes the young officer stood and held it and gazed.

There stood Pappoose, to be sure, but what a change! The little maiden with the dark braids
of hair hanging far below her waist had developed into a tall, slender girl, with clear-cut,
oval face, crowned by a mass of dark tresses. Her heavy, low-arching brows spanned the thoughtful,
deep, dark-brown eyes that seemed to speak the soul within, and the beautiful face was lighted
up with a smile that showed just a peep of faultless white teeth, gleaming through the warm
curves of her soft, sensitive lips. The form was exquisitely rounded, yet supple and erect.

"Hasn't Jessie written you of how Nell has grown and improved?" said Mrs. Hall, with a woman's
quick note of the admiration and surprise in Dean's regard.

"She must have," was the answer, "I'm sure she has, but perhaps I thought it schoolgirl rhapsody--perhaps
I had too many other things to think of."

"Perhaps you'll find it superseding these too many things, Mr. Soldier Boy," was Mrs. Hal's
mental comment. "Now, sir, if you've gazed enough perhaps you'll tell me your plans," and she
stretched forth a reclaiming hand.

But he hung on to the prize. "Let me keep it a minute," he pleaded. "It's the loveliest thing
I've seen in months."

And, studying his absorbed face, she yielded, her eyebrows arching, a pretty smile of feminine
triumph about her lips, and neither noticed the non-commissioned officer hurrying within the
gate, nor that half the men in "C" Troop at their bivouac along the stream were on their feet
and gazing to northeast, that far down the valley a horseman was speeding like the wind, that
little puffs of smoke were rising from the crests of the grand landmark of the range and floating
into the blue of the heavens. Both started to their feet at the abrupt announcement.

"Lieutenant, there are smoke signals on Lar'mie Peak."

CHAPTER VII.

Lieutenant Dean's orders required that he should march his troop without unnecessary delay
to Fork Emory, there to take station relieving Troop "F," ordered to change to Frayne, which
meant, in so many words, to take the field. Captain Brooks, still wrestling with the fever,
had retired to his quarters at the old frontier fort that stood so long on the bluffs overlooking
the fords of the Platte. The surgeon said he must remain in bed at least a week, so meantime
the troop packed up, sent its wagons ahead over the range, bade God speed to "F" as it passed
through en route to the front, exchanged a volley of chaff and chewing tobacco over the parting
game of "freeze out" fought to a finish on many an outspread saddle blanket, then, jogged on
toward Gate City, making wide détour at the suggestion of the field officer in command at Frayne,
that they might scout the Laramie plains and see that all was well at Folsom's ranch. This
détour was duly reported to the peppery veteran at Fort Emory, an old colonel whose command
was by this time reduced from "headquarters, field, staff and band," six companies of infantry
and four troops of cavalry, to the band and two desperately overworked companies of foot. "Two
nights in bed" were all his men could hope for, and sometimes no more than one, so grievous
was the guard duty. Hence "old Pecksniff," his adjutant and quartermaster and his two remaining
companies saw fit to take it as most unkind in Lieutenant-Colonel Ford to authorize that diversion
of Dean's, and highly improper on Dean's part to attempt it. By this time, too, there was in
circulation at Emory a story that this transfer of "C" to interior lines and away from probable
contact with the Sioux was not so much that it had done far more than its share of that arduous
work, completely using up its captain, as that, now the captain was used up, the authorities
had their doubts as to the "nerve" of the lieutenant in temporary command. A fellow who didn't
care to come to Emory and preferred rough duty up along the Platte must be lacking in some
essential particular, thought the women folk, and at the very moment that Marshall Dean sat
there at Hal Folsom's ranch, as brave and hardy and capable a young officer as ever forded
the Platte, looking forward with pleasurable anticipations to those days to come at Emory,
with Jessie--Jessie and, of course, Pappoose--so close at hand in town, there was gaining ground
at the post an impression that the safety of the board of officers sent to choose the site
of the new Big Horn post had been imperiled by Dean's weakening at a critical moment in presence
of a band of probably hostile Sioux. Burleigh had plainly intimated as much to his chief clerk
and Colonel Stevens, and when Loring and Stone came through a day or two later and questions
were asked about that meeting, the aide-de-camp gave it as distinctly to be understood that
he had practically assumed command, Dean's inexperience being manifest, and his own prompt
measures had extricated the little detachment from a most delicate and dangerous position.
The engineer, let it be said, did not hear this statement, and the aid was very careful not
to make it in his presence. He was a comparative stranger and as no one presumed to question
him, he volunteered no information.

Planning to bivouac until dawn of the next day at Folsom's, Dean had then intended to reach
Fort Emory in three easy marches. He was anxious to bring his horses in in best possible condition,
despite all their hard service; yet now, barely two o'clock on this hot June afternoon, came
most unlooked-for, most importunate interruption to his plans. Springing to the gate at the
sergeant's summons, he first directed his gaze to the distant peak, recognized instantly the
nature of the smoke puffs there rising, then turned for explanation to the swift-riding courier,
whose horse's heels were making the dust fly from the sun-dried soil. One or two ranch hands,
with anxious faces, came hastening over from the corral. The darkey cook rushed up from the
kitchen, rifle in hand. Plainly these fellows were well used to war's alarms. Mrs. Folsom,
with staring eyes and dreadful anxiety in her face, gazed only at the hurrying courier, clinging
the while to the pillar of the portico, as though needing support. The smoke puffs on the mountain,
the dust-cloud back of the tearing rider were symptoms enough for Dean.

"Get in your herd, sergeant!" he shouted at the top of his voice; and over the rushing of the
Laramie his words reached the rousing bivouac, and saddle blankets were sent swinging in air
in signal to the distant guards, and within a few seconds every horse was headed for home;
and then, to the sound of excited voices was added the rising thunder of scores of bounding
hoofs, as, all in a dust-cloud of their own, the sixty chargers came galloping in, ears erect,
eyes ablaze, nostrils wide, manes and tails streaming in the breeze, guided by their eager
guards full tilt for camp. Out ran their riders, bridles in hand, to meet and check them, every
horse when within a few yards of his master seeming to settle on his haunches and plow up the
turf in the sudden effort to check his speed, long months of service on the plains and in the
heart of Indian land having taught them in times of alarm or peril that the quicker they reached
the guiding hand and bore, each, his soldier on his back, the quicker would vanish the common
foe. Even before the panting steed of the headlong courier came within hailing distance of
the ranch, half the horses in the troop were caught and the bits were rattling between their
teeth; then, as the messenger tore along the gentle slope that led to the gateway, his wearied
horse laboring painfully at the rise, Mrs. Folsom recognized one of her husband's herdsmen,
a man who had lived long years in Wyoming and could be unnerved by no false alarm, and her
voice went up in a shriek of fear as she read the tidings in his almost ghastly face.

"Where is Hal?" she screamed. "Oh, what has happened?"

"He's safe," was the answering call, as the rider waved a reassuring hand, but at the instant
he bent low. "Thank God, you're here, lieutenant," he gasped. "Mount quick. Hal's corralled
two miles out there under the butte--Sioux!" And then they saw that he was swooning, that the
blood was streaming down the left thigh and leg, and before hand could help him, he rolled
senseless, doubled up in the dust at his horse's feet, and the weary creature never even started.

"Saddle up, men!" rang the order across the stream. And then while strong arms lifted and bore
the wounded herdsman to the porch, Dean turned to the wailing mistress, who, white-faced and
terror-stricken, was wringing her hands and moaning and running wildly up and down the walk
and calling for some one to go and save her husband. Dean almost bore her to a chair and bade
her fear nothing. He and his men would lose not a moment. On the floor at her feet lay the
little card photograph, and Dean, hardly thinking what he did, stooped, picked it up and placed
it in the pocket of his hunting shirt, just as the trumpeter on his plunging gray reached the
gate, Dean's big, handsome charger trotting swiftly alongside. In an instant the lieutenant
was in saddle, in another second a trooper galloped up with his belt and carbine. Already the
men were leading into line across the stream, and, bidding the trumpeter tell Sergeant Shaughnessy
to follow at speed, the young officer struck spur to his horse and, carbine in hand, a single
trooper at his heels, away he darted down the valley, "C" Troop, splashing through the ford
a moment later, took the direct road past the stockade of the corral, disappeared from sight
a moment behind that wooden fortification, and, when next it hove in view, it was galloping
front into line far down the Laramie, then once more vanished behind its curtain of dust.

"Two miles out there under the butte," was the only indication the young officer had of the
scene of the fight, for fight he knew it must be, and even as he went bounding down the valley
he recalled the story of the Indian girl, the threats of Burning Star, the vowed vengeance
of her brothers. Could it be that, taking advantage of this raid of Red Cloud, far from all
the reservations, far from possibility of detection by count of prying agents, the three had
induced a gang of daring, devil-may-care young warriors to slip away from the Big Horn with
them and, riding stealthily away from the beaten trails, to ford the Platte beyond the ken
of watchful eyes at Frayne and sneak through the mountain range to the beautiful, fertile valley
beyond, and there lie in wait for Hal Folsom or for those he loved? What was to prevent? Well
they knew the exact location of his ranch. They had fished and sported all about it in boy
days--days when the soldiers and the Sioux were all good friends, days before the mistaken
policy of a post commander had led to an attack upon a peaceful band, and that to the annihilation
of the attacking party. From that fatal day of the Grattan massacre ten years before, there
had been no real truce with the Sioux, and now was opportunity afforded for a long-plotted
revenge. Dean wondered Folsom had not looked for it instead of sleeping in fancied security.

A mile nearer the butte and, glancing back, he could see his faithful men come bounding in
his tracks. A mile ahead, rising abruptly from the general level, a little knoll or butte jutted
out beyond the shoulders of the foothills and stood sentinel within three hundred yards of
the stream. On the near--the westward--side, nothing could be seen of horse or man. Something
told him he would find the combatants beyond--that dead or alive, Hal Folsom would be there
awaiting him. A glance at the commanding height and the ridge that connected it with the tumbling,
wooded hills to the north, convinced him that at this moment some of the foe were lurking there,
watching the westward valley, and by this time they knew full well of the coming of the cavalry
to the rescue. By this time, more than likely, they were scurrying off to the mountains again,
returning the way they came, with a start of at least two miles.

"With or without the coveted scalps?" he wondered. Thus far he had been riding straight for
the butte. The road wound along and disappeared behind him, but there was no sense in following
the road. "Pursue and punish," was the thing to be done. Surely not more than a dozen were
in the band, else that courier could never have hoped to get in, wounded as he was. The Indians
were too few in number to dare follow to the ranch, guarded as, by almost God-given luck, it
happened to be through the unlooked-for presence of the troops. No, it was a small band, though
a daring one. Its lookout had surely warned it by this time of his coming, and by this time,
too, all save one or two who rode the fleetest ponies and lingered probably for a parting shot
at the foremost of the chase, had scampered away behind the curtain of that ridge. Therefore,
in long curve, never checking his magnificent stride, Dean guided his bounding bay to the left--the
northeast--and headed for the lowest point of the divide.

And then it all occurred to him too that he was far in front of his men, too far to be of use
to them and just far enough to be an easy prey for the lurking foe. Then, too, it occurred
to him that he must not leave the ranch unprotected. Already he was within long rifle range
of the height; already probably some beady eye was glancing through the sights, and the deadly
tube was covering him as he came bounding on. Three hundred yards more and his life probably
wouldn't be worth a dollar in Confederate money, and wisely the young leader began to draw
rein, and, turning in saddle, signaled to his single companion, laboring along one hundred
yards behind, to hasten to join him. Presently the trooper came spurring up, a swarthy young
German, but though straining every nerve the troop was still a mile away.

"Ride back, Wegner, and tell the sergeant to take ten men around that side--the south side
of the bluff," and he pointed with his hand; "the rest to come straight to me."

Oh, well was it for Dean that he checked his speed, and as the young dragoon went sputtering
back, that he himself drew rein and waited for the coming of his men. Suddenly from far out
along the ridge in front, from the very crest there leaped a jet or two of fire and smoke.
Two little spurts of dust and turf flew up from the prairie sod a dozen yards in front, a rifle
bullet went singing off through the sunny air, Rabb, his handsome bay, pawed the ground and
switched about, and up on the crest, riding boldly in full view, two lithe, naked, painted
warriors, war bonnets trailing over their ponies' croups, yelling shrill insult and derision,
went tearing away northward, one of them pausing long enough to wave some ragged object on
high, and give one ringing, exultant whoop ere he disappeared from view.

"It's a scalp, lieutenant," shouted the foremost sergeant as he came lunging up to join his
chief. "They've got one, anyhow."

"Come on, then, and we'll get it back," was the only answer, as with nearly thirty troopers
stringing out behind them, the two launched out in chase.

CHAPTER VIII.

Obedient to his orders the Irish sergeant, with a little squad at his heels, had kept straight
on. A few minutes later, rounding the bluff at the gallop, eyes flashing over the field in
front of them, the party went racing out over the turf and came in full view of the scene of
the fight. Five hundred yards further down stream was a deep bend in the Laramie. Close to
the water's edge two horses lay stretched upon the ground, stone dead. Out on the open prairie
lay an Indian pony still kicking in his dying agony, and as the soldiers came sweeping into
view two men rose up from behind the low bank of the stream and swung their hats--Hal Folsom
and one of his hands safe, unwounded, yet with a look in their gray faces that told of recent
mortal peril.

"We're all right! Go on after them. They've run off a dozen of my best horses," said Folsom,
"and I'm afraid they cut off Jake."

"No! Jake reached the ranch all right--leastwise somebody did," said Shaughnessy. "That's how
we got the news. They got somebody, or else they were only bluffing when they waved that scalp.
How many were there?"

"At least a dozen--too many for you to tackle. Where's the rest of the troop?"

"Close at their heels. The lieutenant led them right over the ridge. Listen!"

Yes, far up in the foothills, faint and clear, the sounds of the chase could now be heard.
Dean's men were closing on the fleeing warriors, for every little while the silence of the
range was broken by the crack of rifle or carbine. Shaughnessy's fellows began to fidget and
look eagerly thither, and he read their wish. "Two of you stay with Mr. Folsom," he said, "and
the rest come with me. There's nothing we can do here, is there? Sure, you're not hit?"

"No, go on! Give 'em hell and get back my horses. I'd go with you, but they've killed what
horses they couldn't drive. All safe at the ranch?"

Shaughnessy nodded as he spurred away. "We'll be gettin' the lieutenant a brevet for this,"
said he, "if we can only close up with those blackguards." And these were the words Folsom
carried back with him, as, mounting a willing trooper's horse, he galloped homeward to reassure
his wife, thanking God for the opportune coming of the little command, yet swearing with close
compressed lips at the ill-starred work of the day. Thus far he had striven to keep from her
all knowledge of the threats of the Ogallallas, although he knew she must have heard of them.
He had believed himself secure so far back from the Platte. He had done everything in his power
to placate Red Cloud and the chiefs--to convince his former friends that he had never enticed
poor Lizette, as Baptiste had called the child, from her home and people. They held he should
never have left her, though she had accused him of no wrong. Burning Star, in his jealous rage,
hated him, because he believed that but for love of the paleface Lizette would have listened
to his wooing, and Folsom's conscience could not acquit him of having seen her preference and
of leading her on. He could not speak of her to his wife without shame and remorse. He had
no idea what could have been her fate, for the poor girl had disappeared from the face of the
earth, and now, at last, this day had proved to him the threats of her lover and her brothers
were not idle. He had had so narrow a squeak for his life, so sharp and sudden and hard a fight
for it that, now that the peril was over, his nerve began to give way, his strong hands to
tremble. Armed with breech-loaders, he and his two friends had been able to stand off the attacking
party, killing two ponies, and emptying, they felt sure, two saddles; but little by little
the Indians were working around their position, and would have crawled upon them within an
hour or two but for Jake's daring ride for help and the blessed coming of the blue-coats in
the nick of time. Folsom swore he'd never forget their services this day.

And as he cantered homeward he could still hear the distant firing dying away in the mountains
to the north. "Give 'em hell, Dean!" he muttered through his set teeth. "They're showing fight
even when you've got 'em on the run. I wonder what that means?"

Not until another day was he to know. Late on the evening of the attack, while he was seated
with his wife by Jake's bedside, half a dozen troopers, two of them wounded and all with worn-out
horses, came drifting back to camp. Twice, said they, had the fleeing Indians made a stand
to cover the slow retreat of one or two evidently sorely stricken, but so closely were they
pressed that at last they had been forced to abandon one of their number, who died, sending
his last vengeful shot through the lieutenant's hunting shirt, yet only grazing the skin. Dean,
with most of the men, pushed on in pursuit, determined never to desist so long as there was
light, but these who returned could not keep up.

Leaving the dead body of the young brave where it lay among the rocks, they slowly journeyed
back to camp. No further tidings came, and at daybreak Folsom, with two ranchmen and a trooper,
rode out on the trail to round up the horses the Indians had been compelled to drop. Mrs. Hal
clung sobbing to him, unable to control her fears, but he chided her gently and bade her see
that Jake lacked no care or comfort. The brave fellow was sore and feverish, but in no great
danger now. Five miles out in the foothills they came upon the horses wandering placidly back
to the valley, but Folsom kept on. Four miles further he and a single ranchman with him came
upon three troopers limping along afoot, their horses killed in the running fight, and one
of these, grateful for a long pull at Folsom's flask, turned back and showed them the body
of the fallen brave. One look was enough for Hal and the comrade with him. "Don't let my wife
know--who it was," he had muttered to his friend. "It would only make her more nervous." There
lay Chaska, Lizette's eldest brother, and well Hal Folsom knew that death would never go unavenged.

"If ever a time comes when I can do you a good turn, lieutenant," said he that afternoon as,
worn out with long hours of pursuit and scout, the troop was encountered slowly marching back
to the Laramie, "I'll do it if it costs me the whole ranch." But Dean smiled and said they
wouldn't' have missed that chance even for the ranch. What a blessed piece of luck it was that
the commanding officer at Frayne had bidden him take that route instead of the direct road
to Gate City! He had sent men riding in to both posts on the Platte, with penciled lines telling
of the Indian raid and its results. Once well covered by darkness the little band had easily
escaped their pursuers, and were now safe across the river and well ahead of all possibility
of successful pursuit. But if anything were needed to prove the real temper of the Sioux the
authorities had it. Now was the time to grapple that Ogallalla tribe and bring it to terms
before it could be reinforced by half the young men in the villages of the northern plains.
The Platte, of course, would be patrolled by a strong force of cavalry for some weeks to come,
and no new foray need be dreaded yet awhile. Red Cloud's people would "lay low" and watch the
effect of this exploit before attempting another. If the White Father "got mad" and ordered
"heap soldiers" there to punish them, then they must disavow all participation in the affair,
even though one of their best young braves was prominent in the outrage, and had paid for the
luxury with his life--even though Burning Star was trying to hide the fresh scar of a rifle
bullet along his upper arm. Together Dean and Folsom rode back to the ranch, and another night
was spent there before the troop was sufficiently rested to push on to Emory.

"Remember this, lieutenant," said Folsom again, as he pressed his hand at parting, "there's
nothing too good for you and "C" Troop at my home. If ever you need a friend you'll find one here."

And the time was coming when Marshall Dean would need all that he could muster.

Two days later--still a march away from Emory--a courier overtook him with a letter from his
late post commander: "Your vigorous pursuit and prompt, soldierly action have added to the
fine record already made and merit hearty commendation." The cordial words brought sunshine
to his heart. How proud Jess would be, and mother! He had not had a word from either for over
a week. The latter, though far from strong, was content at home in the loving care of her sister,
and in the hope that he would soon obtain the leave of absence so long anticipated, and, after
Jess's brief visit to Pappoose's new home, would come to gladden the eyes of kith and kin,
but mother's most of all, bringing Jessie with him. Little hope of leave of absence was there
now, and less was he the man to ask it with such troubles looming up all along the line of
frontier posts to the north. But at least there would be the joy of seeing Jess in a few days
and showing her his troop--her and Pappoose. How wonderfully that little schoolgirl must have
grown and developed! How beautiful a girl she must now be if that photograph was no flatterer!
By the way, where was that photo? What had he done with it? For the first time in four days
he remembered his picking it up when Mrs. Hal Folsom collapsed at sight of Jake's swooning.
Down in the depths of the side pocket of his heavy blue flannel hunting shirt he found it,
crumpled a bit, and all its lower left-hand corner bent and blackened and crushed, Chaska's
last shot that tore its way so close below the young soldier's bounding heart, just nipping
and searing the skin, had left its worst mark on that dainty carte de visite. In that same
pocket, too, was another packet--a letter which had been picked up on the floor of the hut
at Reno after Burleigh left--one for which the major had searched in vain, for it was underneath
a lot of newspapers. "You take that after him," said the cantonment commander, as Dean followed
with the troop next day, and little dreamed what it contained.

That very day, in the heavy, old-fashioned sleeping-cars of the Union Pacific, two young girls
were seated in their section on the northward side. One, a dark-eyed, radiant beauty, gazed
out over the desolate slopes and far-reaching stretches of prairie and distant lines of bald
bluff, with delight in her dancing eyes. The other, a winsome maid of nineteen, looked on with
mild wonderment, not unmixed with disappointment she would gladly have hidden. To Elinor the
scenes of her childhood were dear and welcome; to Jessie there was too much that was somber,
too little that was inviting. But presently, as the long train rolled slowly to the platform
of a rude wooden station building, there came a sight at which the eyes of both girls danced
in eager interest--a row of "A" tents on the open prairie, a long line of horses tethered to
the picket ropes, groups of stalwart, sunburned men in rough blue garb, a silken guidon flapping
by the tents of the officers. It was one of half a dozen such camps of detached troops they
had been passing ever since breakfast time--the camps of isolated little commands guarding
the new railway on the climb to Cheyenne. Papa, with one or two cronies, was playing "old sledge"
in the smoking compartment. At a big station a few miles back two men in the uniform of officers
boarded the car, one of them burly, rotund, and sallow. He was shown to the section just in
front of the girls, and at Pappoose he stared--stared long and hard, so that she bit her lip
and turned nervously away. The porter dusted the seat and disposed of the hand luggage and
hung about the new arrivals in adulation. The burly man was evidently a personage of importance,
and his shoulder straps indicated that he was a major of the general staff. The other, who
followed somewhat diffidently, was a young lieutenant of infantry, whose trim frock-coat snugly
fitted his slender figure.

"Ah, sit down here, Mr.--Mr. Loomis," said the major patronizingly. "So you are going up to
the Big Horn. Well, sir, I hope we shall hear good accounts of you. There's a splendid field
for officers of the right sort--there--and opportunities for distinction--every day."

At sound of the staff officer's voice there roused up from the opposite section, where he had
been dozing over a paper, a man of middle age, slim, athletic, with heavy mustache and imperial,
just beginning to turn gray, with deep-set eyes under bushy brows, and a keen, shrewd face,
rather deeply lined. There was a look of dissipation there, a shade of shabbiness about his
clothes, a rakish cut to the entire personality that had caused Folsom to glance distrustfully
at him more than once the previous afternoon, and to meet with coldness the tentatives permissible
in fellow travelers. The stranger's morning had been lonesome. Now he held his newspaper where
it would partly shield his face, yet permit his watching the officers across the aisle. And
something in his stealthy scrutiny attracted Pappoose.

"Yes," continued the major, "I have seen a great deal of that country, and Mr. Dean, of whom
you spoke, was attached to the troop escorting our commission. He is hardly--I regret to have
to say it--er--what you imagine. We were, to put it mildly, much disappointed in his conduct
the day of our meeting with the Sioux."

A swift, surprised glance passed between the girls, a pained look shot into the lieutenant's
face, but before the major could go on the man across the aisle arose and bent over him with
extended hand.

"Ah, Burleigh, I thought I knew the voice." But the hand was not grasped. The major was drawing
back, his face growing yellow-white with some strange dismay.

"You don't seem sure of my identity. Let me refresh your memory, Burleigh. I am Captain Newhall.
I see you need a drink, major--I'll take one with you."

CHAPTER IX.

For nearly a week after the home-coming of his beloved daughter John Folsom was too happy in
her presence to give much thought to other matters. By the end of that week, however, the honest
old Westerner found anxieties thickening about him. There were forty-eight hours of undimmed
rejoicing. Elinor was so radiant, so fond, and had grown, so said the proud father to himself,
and so said others, so wondrously lovely. His eyes followed her every movement. He found himself
negligent of her gentle little friend and guest, Jessie Dean, to whom he had vowed to be a
second father, and such a friend as she had been to his Pappoose when, a homesick, sad-eyed
child, she entered upon her schooldays. Elinor herself had to chide him, and with contrition
and dismay he admitted his fault, and then for hours nothing could exceed his hospitable attentions
to Jessie, who, sorely disappointed because Marshall was not there to meet her, was growing
anxious as no tidings came from him. Two whole days the damsels spent in going over the new
house, exclaiming over papa's lavish preparations, but wishing presently that Mrs. Fletcher
were not quite so much in evidence, here, there, and everywhere. Only when bedtime came and
they could nestle in one or other of their connecting rooms were they secure from interruption,
and even then it presently appeared they could not talk confidentially as of old. Folsom had
taken them driving each afternoon, he himself handling the reins over his handsome bays, Elinor
at his side the first time, and Jessie, with Mrs. Fletcher, occupying the rear seat. But this,
Elinor whispered to him, was not as it should be. Her guest should have the seat of honor.
So, next day, Jessie was handed to the front and Mrs. Fletcher and Pappoose were placed in
rear, and in this order they bowled round the fort and listened to the band and talked with
several of the women and one or two officers, but these latter could tell nothing about Lieutenant
Dean except that they had been expecting him for two days--he having taken the long way home,
which both Jessie and Pappoose considered odd under the circumstances, though neither said
so and nobody thought to explain. But the morning of the third day "Miss Folsom"--as the veteran
was amazed to hear his daughter addressed, yet on reflection concluded that he'd be tempted
to kick any man who addressed her otherwise--seized a favorable opportunity and whisked her
fond father into a corner of his library, and there gave him to understand that in Eastern
circles the housekeeper might sometimes, perhaps, accompany the young ladies when they were
going shopping, or the like, alone, but that when escorted by papa it was quite unnecessary.
It was in fact not at all conventional.

"Bless my soul!" said Folsom. "I supposed that was what she was for. What did these women mean
by telling me I must have a, companion--a guide--etc.?"

"They meant, you blessed Daddy, that they wished to provide you with--one of their number,
and me--with something I do not want. If Mrs. Fletcher is to be housekeeper I have nothing
to say, but--don't you think your big daughter old enough and wise enough to select her own
companions? Daddy dear," she continued, after a little pause, and nestling close to him with
a pathetic look in the big brown eyes, her lips twitching a bit, "I know how loving and thoughtful
you have been in all this, and I wouldn't have you think me ungrateful, but--did you believe
I was always going to be a little girl? What do you suppose I studied housekeeping for at school?
Mrs. Fletcher is engaged, I presume, and I can't ask you to undo that now, but I wish you had
written to me first. However, if you don't mind, there's somebody I'd rather you would invite
to take the fourth seat to-day, and then you can have Pappoose beside you, if you wish."

"Why, of course, sweetheart, any one you like."

"Lieutenant Loomis, then, Daddy--the officer we met on the train. Jessie likes him and he's
such a friend of her brother--the only one we have yet seen who seems to know him at all. Then
you could ask him to dinner, too."

Folsom's face was a study. Doubt and perplexity both were twitching in the little muscles about
his lips.

"We met three officers, did we not, Elinor, and I had thought--somewhat of--asking the major
and his guest. He said he wished to call. He was here while we were driving yesterday. I met
him later."

"Yes, I saw his card," was the hurried, indifferent answer. "But they are not like Mr. Loomis.
Daddy, I did not at all like that Captain Newhall, or--for that matter----"

"They both seemed prodigiously struck with you," said Folsom, in misguided confidence yet pardonable
pride. "They've done, nothing but talk to me about you ever since."

"They did nothing but talk to me all the way over the mountains, except when they were out
taking what I have reason to believe was an occasional drink, Daddy mine. Jess had Mr. Loomis
to herself. They have found your weak spot, Daddy. They know you love to talk of your daughter.
You have only known Major Burleigh a little while, is it not so?"

"Only within the year, perhaps, though of course I've heard of him a great deal."

"And this Captain Newhall, whose regiment is in Louisiana while he's out here on leave--I thought
officers went East when they got leave."

"Newhall says he's out here looking over some mining schemes. He has money to invest, I believe."

"He should invest some money in a traveling suit, Daddy dear. That coat and his linen seemed
woefully out of condition. Gentlemen are not careless about such matters."

"Oh, he explained that his trunks were delayed in Omaha or somewhere, and were coming along
next train. I own I was prejudiced against him, too, but of course if he's a friend and guest
of Burleigh's he--he must be all right. He's staying with him at the depot."

"And you've got to invite them to dinner?" asked Miss Folsom, after another pause, during which
she had been thinking deeply.

"Not if you don't want it, pet. Of course they'll expect it. Army officers are hospitable,
you know, Burleigh has asked me to dine with him a dozen times, though I've only been there once."

"Then you'll have to invite him, Daddy," was the answer, with quick decision. "Only, just wait
for a day or two. Captain Newhall was going right out to the mines, he said, and there may
be others we'd be glad to have. Jessie's brother ought to be here any hour."

"Yes," said Folsom dubiously. "I've been thinking about him--I've been wishing----"

But he hesitated and faltered and could not meet the deep brown eyes, so full of searching
inquiry and keen intelligence.

"You've been thinking--what, Daddy?" she asked, and now her slender hands were on his shoulders
and she was turning him so that she could study his face. "You have been hearing something
you do not wish us to know, Daddy dear. I heard Major Burleigh say something to Mr. Loomis
about--about Lieutenant Dean, and I know Mr. Loomis did not like it, and Jessie and I can't
believe it. Father, where is he? Why doesn't he come? Why do these--these people at the fort
hem and haw and hesitate when they speak about him? Jessie is getting so troubled."

"I'm getting troubled, daughter," answered Folsom impulsively. "I never met a likelier young
fellow or one that promised to make a better officer. He may be all right, too, only it isn't
so much what they do say as what they don't say that troubles me. Burleigh here and old Stevens
out at the fort and one or two others I've asked about him. Burleigh says he 'lost his nerve'
when they met Red Cloud's big band. A boy might be excused for that so long as he didn't misbehave.
It was big responsibility for a young lieutenant. But these people, as you speak of them out
at the fort, really know very little about Dean. Burleigh says he's in a position that enables
him to know so much more about the character and habits of the young officers."

"Surely he can say nothing against Mr. Dean!" exclaimed Pappoose, looking up with quick indignation
in her brown eyes. "No one knows how good and generous he has been to Jessie and his mother."

They were standing at the moment in the corner of the library farthest from the doorway. The
front windows opened to the north, giving a fine view of the rolling hills rising higher and
higher and looking down upon the grass-grown slopes spread out at their feet, criss-crossed
and traversed by hard-beaten roads and trails. Immediately in front of the house Folsom had
seeded and watered and coaxed into semblance of a lawn the best turf to be had in that section
of Wyoming, and inclosed it in a spick and span white picket fence. The main road between the
fort and the railway station passed directly in front of his gate. The side window of the cozy
room looked out to the west over the valley of a rushing stream, once rich in trout, but now
much infested by the mules from Burleigh's corral, which lay half a mile away to the southeast,
out of sight of Folsom's house except from the upper windows. Eager to stock the library with
standard works against his daughter's coming, the old trader had consulted a friend among the
officers and had sent a lavish order to a house in Chicago. Books, therefore, were there in
plenty on the handsome shelves, and they were not ill-chosen either, but it was Mrs. Fletcher
who pointed out how stiff and angular everything looked, who introduced the easy lounge, the
soft rugs, the heavy hanging portières of costly Navajo blankets. It was her deft touch that
draped the curtains at the windows and softened and beautified the lines the hand of man would
have left crude and repellent. And that library had been her favorite haunt; but since the
coming of the girls Mrs. Fletcher had seemed to retire to her own room aloft, and to spend
no time below stairs that was not demanded by her household duties. Now as the father and daughter
were talking earnestly together, they heard Mrs. Fletcher moving about overhead as though looking
over the work of the housemaid. Jessie had gone to her own room to write a short letter to
her mother. Major Burleigh was to come at 10.30 to drive them out to Pinnacle Butte, a sharp,
rocky height far across the valley, from the summit of which a wonderful view was to be obtained.
It lacked but five minutes of the time and suddenly Mrs. Fletcher's voice was heard on the
floor above. It was a well-modulated voice, gentle and controlled, with a clear, vibrant ring
in it that made the words distinctly audible to the hearers below.

"The major's carriage is coming up the street, Miss Dean. There are two officers."

"Two!" exclaimed Jess, starting to her feet, thinking only of her brother. "Oh! I wonder if--"
And then they heard her go pit-a-pat through the hall to the front of the house, heard Mrs.
Fletcher more deliberately follow, heard presently the beat of horses' hoofs on the hard roadway,
and the whir of coining wheels. "I'll go out to meet them, Elinor--I'll--I'll talk to you more
about this some other time. You don't care to go on this ride this morning one bit, do you
dear?" he added uneasily.

"No, father; frankly, I don't--but he has been polite to you and attentive to us. There's no
help for it."

And so Folsom went alone to the door to meet his visitors on the porch without, and did not
hear, did not see Mrs. Fletcher, who came hastily down the stairs, her face singularly pale,
a glitter of excitement in her eyes. On tiptoe she hastened along the broad hall, reaching
the library door just as Folsom stepped out on the porch. On tiptoe she darted in, closed the
door behind her, almost rushed to the north window, and there grasping the curtain she crouched,
heedless of the possibility of observation, and for half a minute clung and crouched and stared.
Then, as Folsom's genial, powerful voice was heard in welcoming accents, and heavy footsteps
came along the broad board walk, the woman straightened suddenly and, noiseless as before,
hurried back across the room and came face to face with the daughter of the house.

"Oh, Miss Folsom!" she faltered, her bosom heaving in violent agitation. "I did not know you
were here. I--excuse me--" and hastened out of the room and up the winding stairs.

"Pappoose" never hesitated. Coolly, quickly, she stepped to the window. Major Burleigh had
just reached the top step and was exchanging greeting with his host. The stylish team and glistening
wagon were just spinning away.

"It'll be back in five minutes," she, heard the quartermaster explain to her father. "Newhall
has to meet come people coming in by stage from Green River. I thought I'd rather spend the
time here."

And on the back seat, affably waving his hand in adieu, and jauntily lifting his rakish forage
cap in salutation general to any of the young ladies who might be watching, sat the gentleman
whose regiment was in Louisiana while he was up here on leave looking after mining investments.

CHAPTER X.

"Three mortal hours," said Miss Folsom to her fond little school friend and chum that afternoon,
"have I had to sit or stroll with or listen to Major Burleigh. I never once was able to enjoy
the view. What made him hurry us away from the northeast point, do you suppose?"

"Did you notice that, Nell? I did, too, and I was so interested in the view. Away up toward
Laramie Peak I could see something through the glasses that looked like a lot of little ants
crawling along together. It was just after that--just after we looked through the glass, that
he marched us round to the other side. The view toward Green River isn't half as pretty."

"And now he's telling some interminable story to father over their cigars. What shall we do
if he hangs on? Father will have to ask him to drive with us to the fort, and there won't be room."

"Unless Mrs. Fletcher gives up her seat," said Jessie demurely.

"Mrs. Fletcher isn't going. A very different person takes her seat to-day, Jess. Father left
a note for Mr. Loomis at the hotel and he accepted. Now you see why I don't want Major Burleigh."

It was then long after three o'clock. At five they were to start and Jessie could hardly curb
her impatience. The mail from Frayne, so said Folsom, would arrive that evening, and then surely
there would be news of Marshall. They had slipped away to their rooms after the bountiful luncheon
served on their return, in order, as "Pappoose" expressed it, that the gentlemen might have
t­heir cigars in peace. Mrs. Fletcher, after seeing that everything was prepared, had directed
the servant to say to Mr. Folsom, on the return of the party, that she would prefer not to
appear, and would be glad to keep her room, as she did not feel it at all necessary for the
housekeeper to meet strangers, and Folsom felt a sense of relief. It was so much sweeter not
to have any presiding genius other than Pappoose, not that he was forgetful of Mrs. Fletcher's
merits and services--which were great--but it was plain to see that his daughter would have
been happier had no such office existed as that created for this deserving and destitute widow.
At three Miss Folsom had gone and tapped at the lady's door--her room was in the third story
overlooking the street--and was very civilly assured that Mrs. Fletcher stood in need of nothing,
but, being wearied, she would like a little sleep. No, she did not even care for a cup of tea.
Yet Elinor felt confident that the voice that replied to her inquiries came neither from the
bed nor the lounge, but from the direction of the front window.

At three the cigars were smoked out and the host and his guest were in the library. It was
Folsom's custom, when a possible thing, to take a brief nap after the midday meal, and Elinor
felt sure he would be glad of the opportunity now, if Burleigh would only go, but Burleigh
wouldn't. In monotonous monologue his voice came floating up to the second floor, drowsy, unbroken
in its soporific flow, and the girls themselves, after the morning's drive in the clear, bracing
air, felt as though forty winks would be a blessing. Could it be that Burleigh lingered on
in hopes of their reappearance below? Might it not be that if relief came not speedily Papa
Folsom would yield to the spell and fall asleep in his easy-chair? Was it not Miss Folsom's
duty to descend and take the burden of entertainment off those elder shoulders? These thoughts
oppressed the girl, and starting up, she cried:

"It's simply wicked of me staying here and letting poor papa be bored to death. Do come down,
Jess, dear, unless you're dreadfully sleepy. He acts just as though he intended never to go."

And Jess promised reluctantly to come down in ten minutes, if he didn't leave; but she hated
him, and had hated him ever since he spoke so of Marshall in the car three days before.

The upper hall had been quite dark when Miss Folsom went up to inquire how Mrs. Fletcher was
just after luncheon. The door to her little room was tightly closed. The blinds in all the
other rooms aloft were drawn against the glare of the sunshine in the cloudless atmosphere;
yet now, as Pappoose stepped suddenly out upon the landing, she was surprised to see that the
upper floor was much lighter than when she went up half an hour earlier. The maid had not gone
thither from the kitchen, and Mrs. Fletcher wished to doze. Who, then, could have opened both
blind and door and let in that flood of light? Impulsively the active girl flew up the winding
stairs to the third story, and some one suddenly withdrew from the balcony rail, and an instant
later, as Miss Folsom reached the top, all became dark again. Mrs. Fletcher's door had unquestionably
been open, and was now shut to. She must have been out there listening, and gravely the young
girl asked herself what it meant--Mrs. Fletcher's agitation in the library that morning as
she peered out at the major's wagon; her absence from luncheon on account, as she pleaded,
of not desiring to appear when company was present; and now, despite her desire to sleep, her
vigil at the third-floor landing, where she was surely listening to the sounds from below.

Pondering over the facts, Elinor Folsom slowly retraced her steps and went downstairs. She
reached the library none too soon. Old John's eyes were closed, and he was slowly toppling,
over come with sleep. The sound of her cheery voice aroused him, and he started, guilty and
crestfallen.

Burleigh's heavy face brightened visibly at her coming. He cared no more for music than does
a cat, but eagerly followed her across the broad hall into the parlor when she suggested showing
him the beautiful piano papa had given her; and old John, blessing her, lurched for the sofa,
buried his hot head in a pillow, and was asleep in ten seconds. Major Burleigh was alone with
the lovely daughter of the veteran trader. He was a man of the world; she an unsophisticated
girl just out of school--so said Burleigh, albeit a most charming one; and he, who had monopolized
her time the entire morning, bore down once more upon his prize.

She had seated herself at the piano, and her long, taper fingers were rippling over the keys.
She knew full well he did not care what she played, and as for herself she did not care just
then to play at all. She was thinking of his insinuation at Marshall Dean's expense. She was
still pondering over Mrs. Fletcher's stealthy scrutiny of the quartermaster's team. On these
two accounts, and no other, he was possessed of certain interest in Elinor's dark-brown eyes,
and they were studying him coolly, searchingly, as he drew a chair near the piano stool, and
seated himself and met her look with a broad, encouraging smile.

Trill and ripple, ripple and trill her white fingers raced over the keyboard.

"I'm sure you know this waltz, major," she was saying. "They played it beautifully at the Point
two summers ago."

"I--ah, yes, it's a charming composition--charming, though I don't recall it's name just now."

"This? why it's one of Godfrey's--'The Hilda,' don't you know? I'm sure you waltz, major."

"I--ah, used to, yes. I was very fond of a waltz," answered Burleigh, whose best efforts in
that line could result in nothing better than a waddle. "But of late years I--I--since my bereavement--have
practically withdrawn from society." Then, with a languishing smile, he added, "I shall be
tempted to re-enter the list now," and the major drew his chair nearer by full an inch, and
prepared to be further "killing."

"Jessie dances divinely," said Miss Folsom. "She simply floats round a room. You should see
her waltz with her brother, Major Burleigh. They might be waltzing here this very minute if
he were only home. What can have detained him, do you think?"

"I wish I knew," said the quartermaster slowly. "It makes those who are--ah--his friends, you
know, anxious in more ways than one, because there is--er--nothing to warrant delay--nothing
to--excuse it. He should, in fact, have been at his post, where his troop is sorely needed,
full four days ago," and Burleigh looked heavy with portent.

"Is it not possible that he has found something along the lower Laramie--something where his
troop is needed much more than here doing stable guard?"

"How can it be possible?" said Burleigh. "The only thing to warrant his delay would be Indians,
and there are none south of the Platte; or horse thieves, and they hung the last of the gang
three months ago. Mr. Dean, I--ah--regret to say, is fonder of fishing and hunting than of
his legitimate duties, and this, I fear, is why he is not here to welcome his sister."

The piano went rippling on, but the brown eyes kept up their steady gaze. In the deep bass
chords now her slender fingers were entangled. Slowly and thoughtfully the rich melody swung
in the proud waltz rhythm through the airy room and floated out upon the summer breeze. A little
line was setting deep between the dark, arching eyebrows, a symptom Pappoose's schoolmates
had learned to note as a signal for danger, but Burleigh knew her not, as yet.

"It is odd," said she dreamily, "that at the Point the officers spoke so highly of Mr. Dean,
and here you seem to think so differently of him. It is a deep disappointment to his sister
that he is not here; but, do you know, major, we were saying only this morning before you came
that there was some excellent reason for his delay, and we'd know it within another day."

"Oh, ah--er--of course I hope so. I think, pardon me, that that must be a messenger from my
office now," for spurred boot-heels were coming briskly up the wooden walk. There was a bounding
step on the piazza, a ring at the bell. The servant bustled through the hall and threw open
the door. It was not a messenger from the depot, but a stalwart, sunburnt man in rough ranch
garb, who whipped off his broad-brimmed hat and stood abashed within the hall as he asked for
Mr. Folsom.

And all of a sudden over went the piano-stool with a crash, and out into the hall, joyous,
bounding, light as a fairy, a vision of dark, girlish beauty, went Pappoose.

"Why, Ned Lannion!" she cried, as she seized the swarthy young fellow's hands and shook them
up and down "Don't you know me--Winona that used to be? Why, how well you look! When did you
leave the ranch? How did you leave them? Is Hal here--or coming?"

And at sound of her voice old Folsom had started up from his sofa and came trotting out into
the hall, just roused from his sleep, and blinking a bit as he, too, held forth cordial, welcoming
hands. It was a moment before they could let Ned tell his story, and then it came by jerks.

"We left there early yesterday morning, mum. They're all well now, 'cept Jake, and he'll come
out all right, but we had a close call. A war party of Sioux jumped as Wednesday afternoon,
and they'd a got away with us but for Lieutenant Dean and his troop. They come along just in
time----"

"Ned!" gasped Elinor, "you don't mean they attacked the ranch?"

"No'me. We was down the Lar'mie--rounding up horses. There was a dozen bucks in the party.
It's the first time they've come across in a year that I know of, and they won't be apt to
try it again. We shot two of 'em and the cavalry drove 'em a running fight, so hard that they
had to leave one of their wounded behind them. He died in a minute. It was--" and then Ned
Lannion gulped and stumbled and choked in embarrassment.

"Who was it?" demanded Mr. Folsom, his rugged face pale and twitching, his eyes full of anxiety.

"Chaska, sir. You know."

Folsom gripped him by the shoulder. "And Burning Star--did you see him? Was he there?"

"Yes, sir; but those boys of Lieutenant Dean's gave them a lickin' they'll never forget. The
ranch is safe as if it was here in Gate City, only Hal he couldn't come himself, and he knowed
you'd be anxious for full particulars, so he sent me in with the cavalry. They're out at the
fort now."

"Jessie!" cried Elinor, in delight that overmastered the emotion with which she had listened
to the tale of her brother's recent peril. Marshall's here--almost home. It's just as we said,
Jess. Do come down. He was there just in time to save my brother's life--to drive the Indians
back to the river. Come quick--I want to hug you!" And her dark eyes, flashing with joy and
excitement, danced full upon the bulky form of the major, slowly issuing from the parlor door,
then beyond as she went bounding by him, all eagerness to clasp her bonny friend in her arms,
and shower her with congratulations. And so it happened that both the girls were at the rear
of the hall entwined in each other's arms at the foot of the stairs when the ranchman answered
Folsom's next question, and then broke out with the abrupt announcement, "I never see a young
officer handle his men better. We'd all been in hell by this time if it wasn't for him, yet,
by God, sir, the moment he got into the post they clapped him in arrest."

CHAPTER XI.

That evening, when John Folsom, half an hour earlier than the stipulated time, drove the girls
and their friend, Lieutenant Loomis, out to the fort, Major Burleigh was left to his own devices,
and his face plainly showed that he was far from pleased with the way things were going. The
news that Marshall Dean had been placed in arrest by order of the commanding officer of Fort
Emory, following as it did close on the heels of the tidings of that young officer's prompt
and soldierly handling of the crisis at the ranch, made Folsom boil over with wrath. His first
word was one of caution, however. "Hush!" he said, "Speak low. Yonder stands his sister. The
girls must not know yet." Then, leading the way into the library and closing the door behind
them, he demanded all particulars Lannion could give him, which were few enough.

"The lieutenant halted the troop outside the post," said the indignant ranchman, "had it dismount
there while he rode on in to report to the commanding officer for instructions. The colonel
was taking his nap after lunch, and the adjutant was at the office, and what does he do but
get up from his desk solemn-like, and when the lieutenant says 'I report the arrival of Troop
"C" at the post, sir,' the adjutant didn't answer a word, but reached out and got his sabre
and began buckling it around him, and then he put on his cap and gloves, and says he, 'Lieutenant
Dean, I'm sorry, but my instructions are to place you in close arrest, by order of Colonel
Stevens.' Why, you could have knocked me down with the kick of a gopher I was so dumfounded!
The lieutenant he didn't say anything for a minute, but turned white and looked like he could
have knocked the top of the adjutant's head off. 'An officer will be sent to take charge of
the troop,' said the adjutant, 'an' I suppose you'd better confine yourself to your tent, as
the colonel means to have them camp there a day or two, until he hears from Captain Brooks
as to quarters.' 'Well, will you have the goodness to say what charges have been laid against
me?' said Mr. Dean, and the adjutant hemmed, and hawed, and 'lowed that the colonel hadn't
formerly drawn 'em up yet, but that a copy would be served on him as soon as they were ready."

"Then I said I'd go right in and find you, and that's all I know."

And then it was that Folsom turned on Burleigh, with gloom in his eye, and said: "By the Eternal,
Major Burleigh, I hope you've had nothing to do with this!"

"Nothing in the world, I assure you, Mr. Folsom, I--I deeply regret it. Though, as I have told
you, I can hardly be surprised, after what has been said, and--d what I have seen." But the
major could not squarely meet the gaze in the keen eyes of the old trader, nor could the latter
conceal his suspicions. "I know you wish to hear all the particulars of the affair at the ranch
from this gentleman," said the major uneasily, "so I will leave you with him for the present,"
and backing out into the hall he turned to the foot of the winding staircase where Elinor had
met her friend. The girls were still there, their faces clouded with surprise and anxiety.
It was an opportunity not to be lost.

"Pray do not be troubled, Miss Folsom," said Burleigh, advancing upon them with outstretched
hand, "er, Mr. Folsom merely wants to hear further details from Lannion. I wish to extend my
congratulations to you and, ah, this young lady, first upon the fortunate escape of your brother,"
and he bowed over his distended stomach to Elinor, "and second upon the part played by yours,"
and he repeated the bow to Jess, who, however, shrank away from the extended hand. "It will
go far to counteract the stories that I--ah, er--believe you know about--that were in circulation,
and most unjustly, doubtless, at--er--his expense."

"Who put them in circulation, Major Burleigh?" asked Pappoose, her brown eyes studying his
face as unflinchingly as had her father's gaze a moment before.

"That, my dear young lady I--er--cannot surmise. They are mostly imaginative, I dare say."

But Miss Folsom looked unmollified, Miss Dean agitated, and Burleigh himself had many a reason
for feeling ill at ease. Just at the time of all others when he most desired to stand on good
terms with the well-to-do old trader and his charming daughter he found himself the object
of distrust. He was thinking hard and far from hopefully as a moment later he hastened down
the street.

"Tell them to send up my buggy, quick," were his orders as he stepped within his office doorway.
Then lowering his voice, "Has Captain Newhall returned?" he asked the chief clerk.

"The captain was here, sir. Left word he needed to take the first train--freight or construction,
it made no difference--to Cheyenne and expected to find a letter or package from you, and there's
two telegrams in from Department Headquarters on your desk, sir."

The major turned thither with solemn face, and read them both, his back to his subordinate,
his face to the light, and growing grayer every moment. One was a curt notification that ten
thousand dollars would be needed at once at Warrior Gap to pay contractors and workmen, and
directing him to send the amount from the funds in his keeping. The other read as follows:

"Have all transportation put in readiness for immediate field service. Every wheel may be needed."

This he tossed carelessly aside. Over the first he pondered deeply, his yellow-white face growing
dark and haggard.

Ten thousand dollars to be sent at once to Warrior Gap! Workmen's pay! Who could have predicted
that? Who could have given such an order? Who would have imagined payment would have to be
made before July, when some reasonable amount of work had been done? What could laborers do
with their money up there, even if they had it? It was preposterous! It was risky to attempt
to send it. But what was infinitely worse--for him--it was impossible. The money was practically
already gone, but--not to Warrior Gap.

Those were days when inspectors' visits were like those of other angels, few and far between.
The railway was only just finished across the great divide of the Black Hills of Wyoming. Only
as far as Cheyenne was there a time schedule for trains, and that--far more honored in the
breach than the observance. Passengers bound west of that sinfully thriving town were luckier,
as a rule, if they went by stage. Those were days, too, in which a depot quartermaster with
a drove of government mules and a corral full of public vehicles at his command was a monarch
in the eyes of the early settlers; and when, added to these high-priced luxuries, he had on
deposit in various banks from Chicago to Cheyenne, and even here at Gate City, thousands of
dollars in government greenbacks expendible on his check for all manner of purposes, from officers'
mileage accounts to the day laborer's wages, from bills for the roofing of barracks and quarters
to the setting of a single horseshoe, from the purchase of forage and fuel for the dozen military
posts within range of his supply trains down to a can of axle grease. Every one knew Burleigh's
horses and habits were far more costly than his pay would permit. Everybody supposed he had
big returns from mines and stocks and other investments. Nobody knew just what his investments
were, and only he knew how few they were and how unprofitable they had become. Those were days
when, as now, disbursing officers were forbidden to gamble, but when, not as now, the law was
a dead letter. Burleigh had gambled for years; had, with little remorse, ruined more than one
man, and yet stood now awe-stricken and dismayed and wronged by Fate, since luck had turned
at last against him. Large sums had been lost to players inexorable as he himself had been.
Large sums had been diverted from the government channels in his charge, some to pay his so-called
debts of honor, some to cover abstractions from other funds, "robbing Peter to pay Paul," some
to silence people who knew too much; some, ay, most of it, in fact, to cover margins, and once
money gets started on that grade it slips through one's fingers like quicksilver. At the very
moment when Anson Burleigh's envious cronies were telling each other he stood far ahead of
the world, the figures were telling him he stood some twenty thousand dollars behind it, and
that, too, when he was confronted by two imperative calls for spot cash, one for ten thousand
to go to Warrior Gap, another for a sum almost as big to "stake" a man who never yet had turned
an honest penny, yet held the quartermaster where he dare not say so--where indeed he dare
not say no.

"If you haven't it you know where you can get it--where you have often got it before, and where
you'd better get it before it's too late;" these were words said to him that very morning,
in tones so low that none but he could bear; yet they were ringing in his head now like the
boom of some tolling bell. Time was when he had taken government money and turned it into handsome
profit through the brokers of San Francisco and Chicago. But, as Mr. John Oakhurst remarked,
"There's only one thing certain about luck, and that is it's bound to change," and change it
had, and left him face to face with calamity and dishonor. Where was he to raise the ten thousand
dollars that must be sent to the post quartermaster at Warrior Gap? The end of the fiscal year
was close at hand. He dare not further divert funds from one appropriation to cover shortages
in another. He could borrow from the banks, with a good endorser, but what endorser was there
good enough but John Folsom?--the last man now whom he could bear to have suspect that he was
in straits. Folsom was reported to be worth two hundred thousand dollars, and that lovely girl
would inherit half his fortune. There lived within his circle no man, no woman in whose esteem
Burleigh so longed to stand high, and he had blundered at the start. Damn that young cub who
dared to lecture him on the evils of poker! Was a boy lieutenant to shame him before officers
of the general's staff and expect to go unwhipped? Was that butt-headed subaltern to be the
means of ruining his prospects right here and now when he stood so sorely in need of aid? Was
the devil himself in league against him, that that boy's sister should turn out to be the closest
friend old Folsom's daughter ever had--a girl to whom father and daughter both were devoted,
and through her were doubtless interested in the very man he had been plotting to pull down?
Burleigh savagely ground his teeth together.

"Go and hurry that buggy," he ordered, as he crushed the sheet of paper on which he had been
nervously figuring. Then, springing up, he began pacing his office with impatient stride. A
clerk glanced quickly up from his desk, watched him one moment with attentive eye, and looked
significantly at his neighbor. "Old man's getting worse rattled every day," was the comment,
as the crash of wheels through loose gravel announced the coming of the buggy, and Burleigh
hastened out, labored into his seat, and took the whip and reins. The blooded mare in the shafts
darted forward at the instant, but he gathered and drew her in, the nervous creature almost
settling on her haunches.

"Say to Captain Newhall when he gets back-that I'll see him this evening," called Burleigh
over his shoulder. "Now, damn you, go--if you want to!" and the lash fell on the glistening,
quivering flank, and with her head pointed for the hard, open prairie, the pretty creature
sped like mad over the smooth roadway and whirled the light buggy out past the scattered wooden
tenements of the exterior limits of the frontier town--the tall white staff, tipped by its
patch of color flapping in the mountain breeze, and the dingy wooden buildings on the distant
bluff whirling into view as he spun around the corner where the village lost itself in the
prairie; and there, long reaches ahead of him, just winding up the ascent to the post was a
stylish team and trap. John Folsom and the girls had taken an early start and got ahead of him.

Old Stevens was up and about as Folsom's carriage drove swiftly through the garrison and passed
straight out by the northeast gate. "I'll be back to see you in a moment," shouted the old
driver smilelessly, as he shot by the lonely colonel, going, papers in hand to his office,
and Stevens well knew he was in for trouble. Already the story was blazing about the post that
nothing but the timely arrival of Dean and his men had saved Folsom's ranch, and Folsom's people.
Already the men, wondering and indignant at their young leader's arrest, were shouting over
the sutler's bar their pæans in his praise, and their denunciation of his treatment. Over the
meeting of sister and brother at the latter's little tent let us draw a veil. He stepped forth
in a moment and bade his other visitors welcome, shook hands eagerly with Loomis and urged
their coming in, but he never passed from under the awning or "fly," and Folsom well knew the
reason.

"Jump out, daughter," he said to Pappoose, and Loomis assisted her to alight and led her straight
up to Dean, and for the first time in those two years the ex-cadet captain and the whilom little
schoolgirl with the heavy braids of hair looked into each other's eyes, and in Dean's there
was amaze and at least momentary delight. He still wore his field rig, and the rent in the
dark-blue flannel shirt was still apparent. He was clasping Miss Folsom's hand and looking
straight into the big dark eyes that were so unusually soft and humid, when Jessie's voice
was heard as she came springing forth from the tent:

"Look, Nell, look! Your picture!" she cried, as with the bullet-marked carte de visite in her
hand she flitted straight to her friend.

"Why, where did this come from?" asked Miss Folsom in surprise, "and what's happened to it?--all
creased and black there!" Then both the girls and Loomis looked to him for explanation, while
Folsom drove away, and even through the bronze and tan the boy was blushing.

"I--borrowed it for a minute--at the ranch just as Jake came in wounded, and there was no time
to return it, you know. We had to gallop right out."

"Then--you had it with you in the Indian fight?" cried Jess, in thrilling excitement. "Really?
Oh, Nell! How I wish it were mine. But how'd it get so blackened there--and crushed? You haven't
told us."

"Tell you some other time, Jess. Don't crowd a fellow," he laughed. But when his eyes stole
their one quick glance at Elinor, standing there in silence, he saw the color creeping up like
sunset glow all over her beautiful face as she turned quickly away. Lannion had told them of
the close shave the lieutenant had had and the havoc played by that bullet in the breast pocket
of his hunting shirt.

CHAPTER XII.

Meantime "Old Peeksniff," as commentators of the day among the graceless subs were won't to
call Colonel Stevens, was having his bad quarter of an hour. Leaving his team with the orderly,
John Folsom had stamped into his presence unannounced, and after his own vigorous fashion opened
the ball as follows:

"Stevens, what in the devil has that young fellow done to deserve arrest?"

"Oh, ah, shut the door, Mr. Adjutant," said the commanding officer, apprehensively, to his
staff officer, "and--d I desire to confer with Mr. Folsom a moment," whereat the adjutant took
the hint and then hied himself out of the room.

"Now, ah, in the first place, Mr. Folsom this is rather a long and--d painful story. I'm--m--ah,
ah--in a peculiar position."

"For God's sake talk like a man and not like Burleigh," broke in the old trader impulsively.
"I've known you off and on over twenty years, and you never used to talk in this asinine way
until you got to running with him. Come right to the point--What crime is young Dean charged
with? Those girls of mine will have to know it. They will know he's in arrest. What can I tell
them?"

"Crime--ah--is hardly the word, Folsom. There has been a misunderstanding of orders, in short,
and he was placed under arrest before--ah--before I had been furnished with a mass of information
that should have been sent to me before."

"Well, what fault is that of his? See here, man, you don't mean to say it is because he didn't
get here three days ago? That's no crime, and I haven't knocked around with the army the last
forty years not to know the regulations in such matters. Do you mean without ever hearing what
kept him and what splendid, spirited service he rendered there along the Laramie, that you've
humiliated that fine young fellow and put him in arrest?"

Pecksniff whirled around in his chair. "Really now, Mr. Folsom, I can't permit you to instruct
me in my military duties. You have no conception of the way in which I've been ignored and
misled in this matter. There are collateral circumstances brought about, er--forced on me in
fact, by injudicious friends of this young man, and he--he must blame them--he must blame them,
not me. Now if you'll permit me to glance over this mass of matter, I can the sooner do justice
in the premises." And over his goggles the colonel looked pleadingly up into his visitor's
irate features.

"Read all you like, but be quick about it," was the angry rejoinder. "I want to take that boy
back with me to town and confront him with one of his accusers this very day--the man I believe,
by the ghost of Jim Bridger, is at the bottom of the whole business!" and Folsom flopped heavily
and disgustedly into a chair, at sound of a rap at the door, which opened an inch and the adjutant's
nose became visible at the crack.

"Major Burleigh, sir, would like to see you."

"And I'd like to see Major Burleigh!" stormed Folsom, springing to his feet. Commanding officers
of the Stevens stamp had no terrors for him. He had known his man too long.

"Gentlemen, gentlemen!" cried Pecksniff, "I can have no disturbance now over this unfortunate
matter. Really, Mr. Folsom, I cannot permit my office to be the scene of any--of any----"

But his words wandered aimlessly away into space as he discovered he had no listener. Folsom,
finding that the major had apparently changed his mind and was not coming in, had changed his
plan and was going out. He overtook Burleigh on the boardwalk in front and went straight to
the point.

"Major Burleigh, you told me a short time ago that you had nothing to do with the allegations
against this young gentleman who was placed in arrest here this afternoon, yet I learn from
my own daughter that you spoke of him to a brother officer of his in terms of disparagement
the day you got aboard the car at Sidney. Mr. Loomis corroborates it and so does Miss Dean.
I've heard of two other instances of your speaking sneeringly of him. Now I ask you as man
to man what it is you have to tell? He has saved the lives of my son, his wife and child, and
the people of the ranch, and by the Eternal I'm his friend and mean to see justice done him!"

Burleigh listened with solemn face and with no attempt to interrupt. He waited patiently until
Folsom came to a full stop before he spoke at all. Then his voice was eloquent of undeserved
rebuke--of infinite sympathy. "Mr. Folsom," he said, "it would be useless for me to deny that
before I knew your charming daughter or her--ah--very interesting friend I did speak in their
presence--ah--incautiously, perhaps, of Mr. Dean, but it was in continuance of a conversation
begun before we boarded the car, and what I said was more in sorrow than in criticism. The
young gentleman had attracted my attention--my favorable--ah--opinion on the up trip to the
Big Horn, and I was--ah--simply disappointed in his conduct on the way back. It was perhaps
due to--ah--inexperience only, and my whole object in coming here in haste this afternoon was
to bear testimony to his ability and zeal as a troop commander, and to urge--ah--Colonel Stevens
to reconsider his action and restore him at once to duty. I had hoped, sir, to be here--ah--ahead
of you and to have driven him in my buggy--ah--to meet you, but I am disappointed--I am disappointed
in more ways than one."

Folsom stood and wiped his streaming face, and looked the speaker square in the eye, and Burleigh
stood the scrutiny with unlooked-for nerve. Long years at the poker-table had given him command
of his features, and the faculty of appearing the personification of serene confidence in his
"hand," when the twitching of a nerve might cost a thousand dollars. Folsom was no match for
him in such a game. Little by little the anger and suspicion faded from his eyes, and a shame-faced
look crept into them. Had he really so misjudged, so wronged this gentleman? Certainly there
was every appearance of genuine sympathy and feeling in Burleigh's benevolent features. Certainly
he was here almost as soon as he himself had come, and very possibly for the same purpose.
It was all that old fool Pecksniff's doing after all. Folsom had known him for years and always
as more or less of an ass--a man of so little judgment that, though a major in the line at
the outbreak of the war, he had never been trusted with a command in the field, and here he
was now a full colonel with only three companies left him. Burleigh saw his bluff was telling,
and he took courage.

"Come with me," he said, "and let me reassure you," and the doors of the commanding officer's
sanctum opened at once to the omnipotent disburser of government good things, Folsom following
at his heels. "Colonel Stevens," he began, the moment he was inside, and before the colonel
could speak at all, "in a moment of exasperation and extreme nervous--ah--depression the night
I--er--started East so hurriedly after a most exhausting journey from the Big Horn, I spoke
disparagingly of the action of Lieutenant Dean in face of the Indians the day we met Red Cloud's
band, but on mature reflection I am convinced I misjudged him. I have been thinking it all
over. I recall how vigilant and dutiful he was at all times, and my object in hurrying out
here to-day, at--ah--almost the instant I heard of his arrest, was to put in the best words
I could think of in his behalf--to--ah--urge you to reconsider your action, especially in view
of all the--e--ah--encomiums passed upon his conduct in this recent raid on the Laramie."

The colonel whirled around upon him as he had on Folsom. "Major Burleigh," he began, "I call
you to witness that I am the most abused man in the army. Here am I, sir, thirty-five years
in service, a full colonel, with a war record with the regulars that should command respect,
absolutely ignored by these mushroom generals at Omaha and elsewhere--stripped of my command
and kept in ignorance of the movements of my subordinates. Why, sir," he continued, lashing
himself on, as he rose from his chair, "here's my junior at Frayne giving orders to my troop,
sir; presumes to send them scouting the Laramie bottoms, when every man is needed here, and
then, when, as it happens, my officer and his men get into a fight and drive the Indians, to
whom does he report, sir? Not to me, sir--not to his legitimate commander, but he sends couriers
to Laramie and to Frayne, and ignores me entirely."

A light dawned on Burleigh in an instant. Well he knew that Dean's reasons for sending couriers
to those guard posts of the Platte were to warn them that a war party had crossed into their
territory, and was now in flight. There was nothing to be gained by sending a man galloping
back to the line of the railway seventy-five miles to the rear--no earthly reason for his doing
so. But the fact that he had sent runners to officers junior in rank to Stevens, and had not
sent one to him, fairly "stuck in the crop" of the captious old commander, and he had determined
to give the youngster a lesson. But now the mail was in, and dispatches from various quarters,
and a telegram from Omaha directing him to convey to Lieutenant Dean the thanks and congratulations
of the general commanding the department, who had just received full particulars by wire from
Cheyenne, and Stevens was glad enough to drop the game, and Burleigh equally glad of this chance
to impress Folsom with the sense of his influence, as well as of his justice.

"I admit all you say, colonel. I have long--ah--considered you most unfairly treated, but really--ah--in
this case of Lieutenant Dean's, it is, as I said before, inexperience and--ah--the result of-ah--er--not
unnatural loss of--er--balance at a most exciting time. A word of--ah--admonition, if you will
pardon my suggestion, all he probably needs, for he has really behaved very well--ah--surprisingly
well in conducting this--ah--pursuit."

And so was it settled that later the colonel was to see Mr. Dean, and admonish accordingly,
but that meantime the adjutant should go and whisper in his ear that his arrest was ended,
and all would be explained later, thereby releasing him before the girls discovered the fact
that he was confined to his tent.

But the adjutant came too late. The tearful eyes of one, the flushed and anxious faces of both
damsels, and the set look in the eyes of both the young officers at Dean's tent, as the adjutant
approached, told him the cat was out of the bag. "The explanation cannot be made too promptly
for me, sir," said Dean, as he received the colonel's message and permitted the adjutant to
depart without presenting him to the two prettiest girls he had seen in a year. "Now, Loomis,
just as quick as possible I want you to go with me to that man Burleigh. I'll cram his words
down his throat."

"Hush, Dean, of course, I'll stand by you! But--both girls are looking. Wait until to-morrow."

How many a project for the morrow is dwarfed or drowned by events unlooked for--unsuspected
at the time! Not ten minutes later Folsom and Burleigh came strolling together to the little
tent. Ashamed of his apparently unjust accusation, Folsom had begged the quartermaster's pardon
and insisted on his coming with him and seeing the young people before driving back to town.
The horses were being groomed at the picket line. The western sun was low. Long shadows were
thrown out over the sward and the air was full of life and exhilaration. The somber fears that
had oppressed the quartermaster an hour earlier were retiring before a hope that then he dare
not entertain.

"You--you stood by me like a trump, Burleigh," old Folsom was saying, "even after I'd abused
you like a thief. If I can ever do you a good turn don't you fail to let me know."

And Burleigh was thinking then and there how desperately in need of a good turn he stood that
minute. What if Folsom would back him? What if----

But as they came in full view of the picket line beyond the row of tents, the major's eagerly
searching gaze was rewarded by a sight that gave him sudden pause. Halted and examining with
almost professional interest the good points of a handsome little bay, Lieutenant Loomis and
Jessie Dean were in animated chat. Halted and facing each other, he with glowing admiration
in his frank blue eyes, she with shy pleasure in her joyous face, Dean and Elinor Folsom stood
absorbed in some reminiscence of which he was talking eagerly. Neither saw the coming pair.
Neither heard the rapid beat of bounding hoofs nearing them in eager haste. Neither noted that
a horseman reined in, threw himself from saddle and handed Burleigh a telegraphic message which,
with trembling hands, he opened and then read with starting eyes.

"My heaven, Folsom!" he cried. "I ought to have known something was coming when I got orders
to have every mule and wheel ready. Everything's to be rushed to the Big Horn at once. Just
as you predicted, Red Cloud's band has broken loose. There's been a devil of a fight not eighty
miles from Frayne!"

CHAPTER XIII.

And now indeed came for Marshall Dean a time in which he could see a divided duty. A camp of
woodchoppers in one of the deep, sequestered valleys of the mountains had been suddenly set
upon by a host of mounted Indians that seemed, like the warriors born of the dragon's teeth,
to spring up from the earth, and yelling like fiends bore down upon the little guard. Happily
for the woodchoppers, but unluckily for Lo, the commander was a cool-headed veteran of the
late war who had listened time and again to yells as frantic and had withstood charge after
charge ten times as determined. Most unluckily for Lo the infantry company was armed with the
new Springfield breech-loader, and when the band came exultantly on, having, as they supposed,
drawn the fire when full four hundred yards away, they were confounded by the lively crackle
and sputter of rifles along the timber in front of them, toppling many a dashing warrior to
earth and strewing the ground with slaughtered ponies. That charge failed, but they rallied
in furious force. There were only forty soldiers: they had five hundred braves, so on they
came again from three different points, and again did Powell's sheltered blue coats scatter
them like red autumn leaves before the storm. Thrice and four times did they essay to stampede
the soldiers and sweep off their own dead and wounded, and each time were they soundly thrashed,
thanks to cool courage and the new breech-loaders. And Red Cloud, cursing his medicine men,
drew off his baffled braves and the hills that night resounded to their vengeful war-whoops
and echoed back the wailing of the Indian women mourning over the slain. "All well enough so
far, lads," cried Folsom, when he heard the news. "Machpealota is unmasked. It's war to the
knife now, so for God's sake send all the troops you can muster to the aid of those already
up there in the Big Horn. Next time he hits he'll have all the Northern Sioux at his back,
you mark my words!"

But, who the devil is John Folsom? said the Bureau again. Arrest Red Cloud. Bring his band
in prisoners, were the orders to the agents, and the agents called for troops to go and do
their bidding. It's one thing, as I've had occasion to say before, to stand off with breech-loaders
a thousand Indians armed only with old percussion cap muskets, squirrel rifles, bows, clubs
and lances; it's another thing for soldiers armed even with the best the market affords, to
march into an Indian position and arrest an Indian chief. There were not soldiers enough north
of the Platte to do it, and the War Department knew it if the Bureau didn't. Hence the mustering
in force along the river, and the mounting in hot haste of perhaps ten more troops and companies,
nowhere near enough for the work in hand, but all the nation had within a month's march that
could possibly be spared from other work and work more important.

And there was wrath at Emory, where the colonel found himself ordered to send all his transportation
to Frayne forthwith, and all his remaining troops except one of foot. "Damnation! I've only
got two companies of foot," he screamed, in the shrill treble of piping senility. "And they
mean to rob me of my cavalry, too! 'C' troop is ordered to be held in readiness for special
service."

The transportation, consisting of three wagons and two ambulances, with the somber company
of infantry, started next day, however, and Dean, with eager expectancy kept his men in camp,
cooked rations ready, ammunition pouches filled, arms and equipments overhauled and in perfect
order, horses examined and reshod, ready for the word that might come any minute and carry
him--he knew not whither. Folsom and the girls had to drive back to dinner without him. Despite
the permission sent by the colonel, he would not leave his troop and go in town. So back they
came in the soft moonlight and spent a long, lovely summer evening with him, while the band
played melodiously in the fort inclosure, and the stars twinkled over the peaks of the Rockies
in the southern skies. Folsom spent the hours wiring to Omaha and conferring with such officers
as he could reach. They thought the lesson given Red Cloud would end the business. He knew
it would only begin it. Burleigh, saying that he must give personal attention to the selection
of the teams and wagons, spent the early evening in his corral, but sent word to Folsom that
he hoped to see him in the morning on business of great importance. He had other hopes, too,
one of them being that now the order to send that big sum in currency to the new stockade would
be revoked. He had lost no time in suggesting to the chief quartermaster of the department
the extreme hazard. He quoted Folsom as saying that before we could send one hundred men to
Warrior Gap Red Cloud could call five thousand, and the chief quartermaster, being a man of
method and a stranger to the frontier said, as said the Bureau "Who the devil is John Folsom?
Do as you are told." But that answer only came the following day. Meantime there was respite
and hope.

Long lived that beautiful evening in the memory of four young hearts. A sweet south wind had
been gently playing all day and left the night warm and fragrant of the pines and cedars in
the mountain parks. All Fort Emory seemed made up of women and children now, for such few soldiers
as were left, barring the bandsmen, were packing or helping pack and store about the barracks.
From soon after eight until nearly ten the musicians occupied their sheltered wooden kiosk
on the parade, and filled the air with sweet strains of waltz or song or stirring martial melody.

For an hour, with Elinor Folsom on his arm, young Dean was strolling up and down the moonlit
walk, marveling over the beauty of her dark, yet winsome face, and Loomis and Jessie, stanch
friends already, sauntered after them. For a time the merry chat went on unbroken. They were
talking of that never-to-be-forgotten visit to the Point--Pappoose's first--and of the hop
to which the tall cadet captain took the timid schoolgirl, and of her hop card and the distinguished
names it bore, as names ran in the old days of the battalion; of Ray, who danced so beautifully
and rode so well--he was with the --th cavalry now somewhere along the U. P., said Dean--and
of Billings the cadet adjutant; he was with a light battery in Louisiana. "Where this Captain
Newhall is stationed," interrupted Pappoose, with quick, upward look. "I wonder if he knows
him, Mr. Dean."

"He doesn't like him, I'll venture to say," said Dean, "if Newhall doesn't suit you and Jessie,
and I'm sure I shan't." And then they went on to talk of the lovely dance music they had at
the Point that summer, and how bewitchingly Elsen used to play that pretty galop--"Puckwudjies"--the
very thing for a moonlit night. One could almost see the Indian fairies dancing about their
tiny fires.

"It was that galop--my first at West Point--that I danced with Cadet Captain Dean," said Pappoose,
looking blithely up into his steadfast eyes. "You've no idea what a proud girl I was!" They
were at the upper end of the parade at the moment. The kiosk was only fifty yards away, its
band lights sparkling under the canopy, the moonlight glinting on the smooth surface of the
dancing floor that an indulgent post commander had had placed there. Half a dozen young garrison
girls, arm in arm and by twos, were strolling about its waxen face awaiting the next piece;
and some of them had been importuning the leader, for at the moment, soft and rippling, sweet
and thrilling, quick and witching, the exquisite opening strains of "Puckwudjies" floated out
upon the night.

"Oh, Jess! Listen!" cried Elinor in ecstasy and surprise, as she turned back with quickly beating
heart.

"No, no, indeed!" replied her soldier escort, with a throb in his breast that echoed and overmastered
that in her own. "No time to listen--come! It was your first galop at the Point--let it be
our first in Wyoming." And in a moment more the tall, lithe, supple, slender forms were gliding
about the dancing-floor in perfect time to the lovely music, but now her dark eyes could not
meet the fire in the blue. Following their lead, Loomis and Jessie joined the dance. Other
couples from along the row hastened to the scene. In five minutes a lively hop was on at Emory,
and when at last, breathing a little hurriedly and with heightened color, Elinor Folsom glanced
up into his joyous and beaming face--"You had forgotten that galop, Mr. Dean," she archly said,
but down went the dark eyes again at his fervent reply.

"Yes, I admit it; but so long as I live I'll never forget this."

Small wonder was it that when Burleigh came driving out at tattoo for a brief conference with
the colonel, his sallow face took on a darker shade as he suddenly caught sight of that couple
standing at the moment apart from the dancers, seeing neither them nor him, hearing for the
moment no music but that which trembled in the tones of his deep voice, for Elinor was strangely
silent.

"Marshall Dean," whispered Jessie that night, as she hugged him before being lifted to her
seat, "tell me true, wasn't Pappoose's picture in your heart pocket? Didn't that bullet crease it?"

"Promise on your honor not to tell, Jess," he whispered.

She nodded delightedly.

"Yes, and what's more, it's there now!"

Early on the morrow came further news. Troops from Steele and Bridger were on the move, but
no word came for the cavalry at Emory, and Marshall Dean, hitherto most eager for field service,
learned with joy he felt ashamed to own that he had still another day to spend in the society
of Jessie and her friend. But how much of that elation Jessie could have claimed as due to
her every sister whose brother is in love can better tell than I. At eight they came driving
out to hear the band at guard-mounting, though to old Pecksniff's pathetic sorrow he could
mount only twelve men all told. That ceremony over, they watched with kindling eyes the sharp
drill of Marshall's troop; that soldierly young commander, one may feel well assured, showing
his men, his horses, and himself off to the best of his ability, as who would not have done
under such scrutiny as that. Loomis was with them, but Elinor drove, for her father had urgent
business, he said, and must remain at his office. Major Burleigh, he added, was to meet him,
whereat the girls were silent.

"If you could have beard the major pleading with that cantankerous old fool at the fort in
Marshall's behalf you would get over your wrath at Burleigh just as I did," said Folsom, to
both, apparently, and still neither answered. Burleigh was evidently persona non grata in the
eyes of both. "He tells me Captain Newhall is still here, waiting for a train to be made up
to run back to Cheyenne. I'm afraid I'll have to ask him to bring the captain to dinner to-day.
Do you think Mr. Dean will care to come?" he asked.

"I think he would rather not leave camp," said Jessie slowly. "Orders may come any minute,
he says."

"Yes, I suppose so," answered Folsom, vaguely relieved. Something told him there was antagonism
between the young fellow and Burleigh that would be apt to involve Newhall, too. "I'll ask
them both, if you don't very much mind," he went on, whispering to Elinor. "And will you tell
Mrs. Fletcher? How is she this morning?"

"Just as usual, papa. She says she has rather violent headaches once in a while, and she thinks
it prudent to keep her room to-day. But I can attend to everything." Indeed, thought the daughter,
she wished she had it all to do.

And so Folsom had gone to meet Burleigh, and the girls had planned, at least Jessie had, that
Marshall after drill should ride beside them into town and have a chat in the parlor while
she wrote to mother in the library. But a thing happened that no one could have foreseen. Just
before drill was over and while they were still watching it from their seats in the covered
wagon, a buggy drove up alongside and Major Burleigh jumped out, gave the reins to his companion
and bade him come to him as soon as he had finished what he wished to do at the sutler's. The
major's face was perturbed, that of his companion looked black and ugly. It was Captain Newhall,
and something was amiss. The latter barely tipped his hat in driving away, the former heaved
a sigh of relief, then turned to greet the girls.

Ten minutes passed in constraint and awkwardness. Burleigh felt that he was unwelcome, but
his eyes were fixed in fascination on Elinor Folsom, and he could not go. Presently drill was
dismissed, and Dean, all aglow, came galloping up, his orderly trumpeter following. Not until
he had joyously greeted both the girls did he see who was standing by the forward wheel on
the opposite side.

"Good-morning, Mr. Dean," said Burleigh affably. "I never saw that troop look so well."

"Good-morning, sir," said Dean coldly. Then turned to speak again to Miss Folsom when the buggy
came whirring back.

"He isn't here, Burleigh," said the occupant petulantly. "He's in town, and you've got to find
him right off. Come on!"

Burleigh turned livid. "Captain Newhall," he said, "you fail to notice I am with friends."

"They are friends who will be glad to get rid of you, then," replied the stranger thickly,
and it was easy to see that he had been drinking. All the same Burleigh went.

CHAPTER XIV.

Another day Dean and Troop "C" were held in camp awaiting orders for special service, and no
orders came. "Old Pecksniff" had an eye for pretty girls, a trait by no means rare in soldiers
old or young, and prettier girls than Pappoose and Jessie he had never met. Mrs. Stevens was
accordingly bidden to invite them to luncheon that very day, and Dean and Loomis were of the
party, as were other young people of the post, and, despite the rising war clouds in the north
and the recent unpleasantness at Emory and an odd manner indicative of suppressed excitement
on part of both Dean and Loomis, a very joyous time they had until the damsels Had to drive
home to dress for dinner. Folsom had named six as the hour. Burleigh, Newhall and the two boys
were mentioned as his guests. Burleigh accepted for self and partner, Loomis for himself, with
mental reservation. Dean at once had begged to be excused. After the morning's disappearance
of Burleigh and "Surly," as Miss Folsom promptly named the pair, Marshall had ridden into Gate
City at the side of the Folsom carriage, and was welcomed by the old trader himself, who looked
pained when told he could not attend the dinner. "Surely Colonel Stevens will let you off,"
said Folsom, but that obviously was not the reason.

"I'm the only officer with my troop," said Dean, "and so cannot ask."

But when Folsom took his daughter in his arms a little later and inquired whether there were
not some graver cause behind the one assigned, Elinor calmly answered that she thought there
was, and that the cause was Major Burleigh.

"But, daughter dear," said he, "that's just one reason I wish to bring them together. Then
Dean could see how pleasantly disposed the major is," and he was amazed when she replied:

"Major Burleigh may be pleasantly disposed, but Mr. Dean is not, by any means, nor would I
be were I in his place, papa."

"My child," said he, "what do you know about it?"

"Everything that Jessie knows, besides what we heard on the train. Mar--Mr. Dean told her of
several things Major Burleigh had said and done to his discredit, and no wonder he declines
to dine with a man who has deliberately maligned him."

"I wish I had thought of that," said Folsom, his knotty hands deep in the pockets of his loose-fitting
trousers. "I saw Burleigh this morning on some business, and he seemed to want to help Dean
along. What took him out to the fort, do you suppose?"

"I don't know," she answered gravely. "He had Captain Newhall with him, in quest of somebody
who wasn't there."

"Ah, yes, Griggs, the sutler. I heard of it," interposed Folsom, fingering his watchchain.

"Very possibly. The captain was ugly and rude in manner and Major Burleigh very much embarrassed.
Indeed, Daddy dear, I should not be greatly surprised if others of your party failed to come."

"Burleigh, do you mean, or his queer guest?"

But Pappoose did not reply. She seemed listening intently, and then with swift, sudden movement
darted across to the heavy Navajo blanket portière that hung at the doorway of a little room
back of the library. Her voice was far from cordial as she asked:

"Were you looking for any one, Mrs. Fletcher? I thought you were in your room."

"For Mr. Folsom, please, when he is at leisure," was the answer, in unruffled tones. "I believe
it easier to take active part in the preparations than to lie there thinking."

At one the girls were to lunch at the fort, as has been said, and it was time for them to dress.
There were other matters on which Elinor much wished to talk with her father and, with more
reluctance than she had yet experienced, she left him to hear what Mrs. Fletcher might have
to say. The conference was brief enough, whatever its nature, for presently his voice was heard
at the foot of the stairs.

"I'm going over to the depot a few minutes, Daught. I wish to see Burleigh. Don't wait for
me. Start whenever you are ready. Where do the boys meet you?"

"Here, Daddy, at half-past twelve."

It was high noon now, and the ruddy-faced old fellow grew redder as the summer sun beat down
on his gray head, but he strode sturdily down the broad avenue that led to the heart of the
bustling new town, turned to the right at the first cross street beyond his own big block,
and ten minutes' brisk tramp brought him to the gateway of Burleigh's stockaded inclosure.
Two or three employees lounging about the gate were gazing curiously within. Silently they
let him pass them by, but a sound of angry voices rose upon the heated air. Just within the
gate stood the orderly trumpeter holding two horses by the reins, one of them Marshall Dean's,
and a sudden idea occurred to Folsom as he glanced at the open windows of the office building.
There was no mistaking the speaker within. It was Burleigh.

"Leave my office instantly, sir, or I'll prefer charges that will stick----"

"Not till I've said what I came to say, Major Burleigh. I've abundant evidence of what you've
been saying at my expense. You asserted that I lost my nerve the day we met Red Cloud's band--you
who never dared get out of the ambulance until the danger was over. It's common talk in the
troop. At Frayne, at Reno, and here at Emory you have maligned me just as you did in the cars
to my friend here, Mr. Loomis, and in hearing of my sister. I will not accept your denial nor
will I leave your office till you swallow your words."

"Then, by God, I'll have you thrown out, you young whipsnapper!"

And then Folsom, with fear at his heart, ran around to the doorway to interpose. He came too
late. There was a sound of a furious scuffle within, a rattling of chairs, a crunching of feet
on sanded floor, and as he sprang up the steps he saw Dean easily squirming out from the grasp
of some member of the clerical force, who, at his master's bidding, had thrown himself upon
the young officer, who then deftly tripped his heels from under him and dropped him on the
floor, while Loomis confronted the others who would have made some show of obeying orders.
And then there was the whirr of a whip-lash, a crack and snap and swish, and a red welt shot
across Burleigh's livid face as he himself staggered back to his desk. With raging tongue and
frantic oath he leaped out again, a leveled pistol in his hand, but even before he could pull
trigger, or Folsom interpose, Loomis's stick came down like a flash on the outstretched wrist,
and the pistol clattered to the floor.

"Good God, boys! what are you doing?" cried the trader, as he hurled himself between them.
"Stop this instantly. Sit down, Burleigh. Come out, Dean--come out at once! And you, too, Loomis."

"I'm entirely ready--now," said the cavalry lieutenant, though his eyes were flaming and his
lips were rigid. "But whenever Major Burleigh wants to finish this he can find me," and with
these words he backed slowly to the door, face to the panting and disordered foe.

"Finish this! you young hound, I'll finish you!" screamed Burleigh, as he shook his clinched
fist at the retiring pair.

"Go, boys, go!" implored Folsom. "I'll see you by and by. No--no--sit still, Burleigh. Don't
you speak. This must stop right here."

And so the old man's counsels prevailed, and the two friends, with grave, pallid, but determined
faces, came out into the sunshine, and with much deliberation and somewhat ostentatious calm
proceeded to where the orderly waited with the horses.

"You will see--the ladies out to camp, Loomis?" asked Dean. "I must gallop on ahead."

"Ay, ay, go on, I reckon----"

But on this scene there suddenly appeared a third party, in the partial guise of an officer
and the grip of Bacchus. Lurching down the office steps, with flushed face and bloodshot eyes,
came Captain Newhall.

"Gen'l'm'n," said he thickly, "le'm 'ntroduce m'self. Haven't th' honor y'r 'quain's. I'm Ca'm
New(hic)'ll. Cap'n N-n-(hic)oohaul (this cost prodigious effort and much balancing), an'--an'
you sherv'd that f'ler per-per-flicky ri'. He's dam scoun'rl--gen'lemen--an' ole frien' mine."

For an instant he stood swaying unsteadily, with half-extended hand. For an instant the two
young officers gazed at him in contempt, then turned abruptly away.

"Good Lord, Marshall," said Loomis, as they cleared the gate, "if that's the only approbation
this day's work will bring us what will the results be? You served him right, no doubt, but--"
and an ominous shake of the head wound up the sentence.

"But or no but," said Dean, "it's done now, and I'd do it again."

There was no dinner party at Folsom's that evening. At two a messenger trotted out to the post
with a note for Miss Folsom to apprise her of the fact, and without a word or change of color
she put it into her pocket. The garrison girls were bent on having them spend the afternoon,
but presently Miss Folsom found a moment in which to signal to Jess, and at three they were
driving home.

"You will surely come out this evening and hear the music and have a dance," were the parting
salutations, as with skillful hands the young girl took up the reins.

"We hope to," was her smiling answer. Jess was clinging to her brother's hand as he stood by
the wheel, and Loomis had already clambered in beside her.

"Please come, Marshall," pleaded Jessie; but he shook his head.

"I must be at camp this evening, sister mine. We go to stables in an hour. You will come back,
Loomis?"

"As soon as I've seen--" and a significant nod supplied the ellipsis.

Something ominous was in the wind and both girls knew it. Loomis, usually gay and chatty, was
oddly silent, as the light, covered wagon sped swiftly homeward. Beside the fair charioteer
sat a young officer of the infantry who, vastly rejoicing that Dean could not go, had laughingly
possessed himself of the vacant place, and to him Miss Folsom had to talk. But they parted
from their escorts at the gate and hastened within doors. Just as Elinor expected, papa had
not come home. It was nearly six when she saw him striding slowly and thoughtfully up the road,
and she met him at the gate.

"Tell me what has happened, Daddy," was her quiet greeting, as she linked her hands over his
burly arm, and looking into her uplifted, thoughtful eyes, so full of intelligence and deep
affection, he bent and kissed her cheek.

"By Jove, daughter, I believe it's the best thing I can do. Come into the library."

That night the moon beamed brightly down on the wide-spreading valley, glinting on the peaks,
still snow-tipped, far in the southern sky, and softening the rugged faces of the nearer range,
black with their clustering beard of spruce and pine. The band played sweetly on the broad
parade until after the tattoo drums had echoed over the plains and the garrison belles strolled
aimlessly in the elfin light--all nature so lavishly inviting, yet so little valued now that
nearly every man was gone. Out in the camp of "C" Troop men were flitting swiftly to and fro,
horses were starting and stamping at the picket ropes, eager eyes and tilted ears inquiring
the cause of all this stir and bustle among the tents. In front of the canvas home of the young
commander a grave-faced group had gathered, two gentle girls among them, one with tear-dimmed
eyes. Old Folsom stood apart in murmured conference with Griggs, the sutler. The regimental
quartermaster was deep in consultation with Dean, the two officers pacing slowly up and down.
One or two young people from the garrison had spent a few minutes earlier in the evening striving
to be interesting to the girls; but Jessie's tearful eyes and Miss Folsom's grave manner proved
hint sufficient to induce them to withdraw, each bidding Dean good night, safe journey and
speedy return, and the hand-clasps were kind and cordial. The colonel himself had paid a brief
visit to camp, his adjutant in attendance, and had given Mr. Dean ten minutes of talk concerning
a country Dean knew all about, but that "Pecksniff" had never seen. "It is a responsibility
I own I should have expected to see placed on older shoulders," said he, "but prudence and--and,
let me suggest, cool-headedness--will probably carry you through. You will be ready to start----"

"Ready now, sir, so far as that's concerned; but we start at three."

"Oh, ah--yes, of course--well--ah--it leaves me practically with no command, but I'll hope
to have you back, Mr. Dean. Good-by." Then as he passed Folsom the colonel whispered: "That's
ten thousand dollars as good as thrown away."

"Ten thousand dollars!" answered the trader in reply. "What do you mean?"

"That's what those boys are to run the gauntlet with. My--ah--protests are entirely unavailing."

For a moment Folsom stood there dumb. "Do you mean," he finally cried, "that--that it's beyond
Frayne that they're going--that it's money they're to take?"

"Hush! Certainly, but it mustn't be known. Every road agent in Wyoming would be out, and every
Indian from the Platte to Hudson's Bay would be on the watch. He's to take ten men and slip
through. The money comes out from Burleigh to-night."

The colonel turned away, and, beckoning to his staff officer to join us, stumped onward to
the garrison. The prolonged wail of the bugle, aided by the rising night wind, sent the solemn
strains of taps sailing down the dimly-lighted valley, and with staring eyes old Folsom stood
gazing after the departing officers, then whirled about toward the tents. There in front of
Dean stood Pappoose, her hands clasped lightly over the hilt of the saber the "striker" had
leaned against the lid of the mess chest but a moment before, her lovely face smiling up into
the owner's.

"You'll come back by way of Hal's, won't you?" she was blithely saying. "Perhaps I can coax
father to take us there to meet you."

"By heaven, Burleigh," muttered the old trader to himself, "are you the deepest man I ever
met, or only the most infernal scoundrel?"

CHAPTER XV.

A sleepless night had old John Folsom, and with the sun he was up again and hurriedly dressing.
Noiseless as he strove to be he was discovered, for as he issued from his room into the dim
light of the upper hall there stood Pappoose.

"Poor Jess has been awake an hour," said she. "We've been trying to see the troop through the
glass. They must have started before daybreak, for there's nothing on the road to Frayne."

"It disappears over the divide three miles out," he answered vaguely, and conscious that her
clear eyes were studying his face. "I didn't sleep well either. We shall be having news from
Hal to-day, and the mail rider comes down from Frayne."

She had thrown about her a long, loose wrapper, and her lustrous hair tumbled like a brown-black
torrent down over her shoulders and back. Steadfastly the brown eyes followed his every move.

"It is hours to breakfast time, Daddy dear; let me make you some coffee before you go out."

"What? Who said I was going out?" he asked, forcing a smile; then, more gravely: "I'll be back
in thirty minutes, dear, but wait a moment I cannot. I want to catch a man before he can possibly
ride away."

He bent and kissed her hurriedly, and went briskly down the stairs. In the lower hall he suddenly
struck a parlor match that flared up and illumined the winding staircase to the third story.
Some thought as sudden prompted her to glance aloft just in time to catch a glimpse of a woman's
face withdrawing swiftly over the balcony rail. In her hatred of anything that savored of spying
the girl could have called aloud a demand to know what Mrs. Fletcher wanted, but strange things
were in the wind, as she was learning, and something whispered silence. Slowly she returned
to Jessie's side, and together once more they searched with the glasses the distant trail that,
distinctly visible now in the slant of the morning sun, twisted up the northward slopes on
the winding way to Frayne. Not a whiff of dust could they see.

Meantime John Folsom strode swiftly down the well-known path to the quartermaster's depot,
a tumult of suspicion and conjecture whirling in his brain. As he walked he recalled the many
hints and stories that had come to his ears of Burleigh's antecedents elsewhere and his associations
here. With all his reputation for enterprise and wealth, there were "shady" tales of gambling
transactions and salted mines and watered stocks that attached perhaps more directly to the
men with whom he foregathered than to him. "A man is known by the company he keeps," said Folsom,
and Burleigh's cronies, until Folsom came to settle in Gate City, had been almost exclusively
among the "sharps," gamblers, and their kindred, the projectors and prospectors ever preying
on the unwary on the outer wave of progress. Within the past six months he had seen much of
him, for Burleigh was full of business enterprises, had large investments everywhere, was lavish
in invitation and suggestion, was profuse in offers of aid of any kind if aid were wanted.
He had gone so far as to say that he knew from experience how with his wealth tied up in real
estate and mines a man often found himself in need of a few thousands in spot cash, and as
Folsom was buying and building, if at any time he found himself a little short and needed ten
or twenty thousand say, why, Burleigh's bank account was at his service, etc. It all sounded
large and liberal, and Folsom, whose lot for years had been cast with a somewhat threadbare
array of army people, content with little, impecunious but honest, he wondered what manner
of martial man this was. Burleigh did not loudly boast of his wealth and influence, but impressed
in some ponderous way his hearers with a sense of both. Yet, ever since that run to Warrior
Gap, a change had come over Burleigh. He talked more of mines and money and showed less, and
now, only yesterday, when the old man's heart had mellowed to him because he had first held
him wholly to blame for Dean's arrest and later found him pleading for the young fellow's release,
a strange thing had happened. Burleigh confided to him that he had a simply fabulous opportunity--a
chance to buy out a mine that experts secretly told him was what years later he would have
called a "bonanza," but that in the late sixties was locally known as a "Shanghai." Twenty-five
thousand dollars would do the trick, but his money was tied up. Would Folsom go in with him,
put up twelve thousand five hundred, and Burleigh would do the rest? Folsom had been bitten
by too many mines that yielded only rattlesnakes, and he couldn't be lured. Then, said Burleigh,
wouldn't Folsom go on his note, so that he could borrow at the bank? Folsom seldom went on
anybody's note. It was as bad as mining. He begged off, and left Burleigh disappointed, but
not disconcerted. "I can raise it without trouble," said he, "but it may take forty-eight hours
to get the cash here, and I thought you would be glad to be let in on the ground floor."

"I've been let in to too many floors, major," said he. "You'll have to excuse me." And so Burleigh,
with his Louisiana captain, had driven off to the fort, where Newhall asked for Griggs and
was importunate, nor did Griggs's whisky, freely tendered to all comers of the commissioned
class, tend to assuage his desire. Back had they gone to town, and then came the cataclysm of noon.

In broad daylight, at his official desk, in the presence and hearing of officers, civilians
and enlisted men, as the soldier lawyers would have it, a staff official of high rank had been
cowhided by a cavalry subaltern, and that subaltern, of all others, the only brother of Folsom's
fair guest, Jessie Dean--the boy who had saved the lives of Folsom's son and his son's imperiled
household, and had thereby endeared himself to him as had no other young soldier in the service.
And now, what fate was staring him in the face? Released from arrest but a day or so before
upon the appeal of the officer whom he had so soon thereafter violently assaulted, Marshall
Dean had committed one of the gravest crimes against the provisions of the Mutiny Act. Without
warrant or excuse he had struck, threatened, assaulted, etc., a superior officer, who was in
the discharge of his duty at the time. No matter what the provocation--and in this case it
would be held grossly inadequate--there could be only one sentence--summary dismissal from
the army. Just as sure as shooting, if Burleigh preferred charges that boy was ruined.

And for mortal hours that afternoon it looked as though nothing could hold Burleigh's hand.
The man was livid with wrath. First he would have the youngster's blood, and then he'd dismiss
him. Folsom pointed out that he couldn't well do both, and by two o'clock it simmered down
to a demand for instant court-martial. Burleigh wrote a furious telegram to Omaha. He had been
murderously assaulted in his office by Lieutenant Dean. He demanded his immediate arrest and
trial. Folsom pleaded with him to withhold it. Every possible amende would be made, but no!
Indeed, not until nearly four o'clock could Folsom succeed in the last resort at his disposal.
At that hour he had lent the quartermaster fifteen thousand dollars on his unindorsed note
of hand, on condition that no proceedings whatever should be taken against Mr. Dean, Folsom
guaranteeing that every amende should be made that fair arbitration could possibly dictate.
He had even gone alone to the bank and brought the cash on Burleigh's representation that it
might hurt his credit to appear as a borrower. He had even pledged his word that the transaction
should be kept between themselves.

And then there had been a scene with that drunken wretch Newhall. What possible hold had he
on Burleigh that he should be allowed to come reeling and storming into the office and demanding
money and lots of money--this, too, in the presence of total strangers? And Burleigh had actually
paid him then and there some hundreds of dollars, to the stupefaction of the fellow--who had
come for a row. They got him away somehow, glad to go, possibly, with his unexpected wealth,
and Burleigh had explained that that poor devil, when he could be persuaded to swear off, was
one of the bravest and most efficient officers in the service, that he was well to do, only
his money, too, was tied up in mines; but what was of more account than anything else, he had
devotedly and at risk of his own life from infection nursed his brother officer Burleigh through
the awful epidemic of yellow fever in New Orleans in '67. He had saved Burleigh's life, "so
how can I go back on him now," said he.

All this was the old trader revolving in mind as he hastened to the depot, all this and more.
For two days Marshall Dean and "C" troop had stood ready for special service. Rumor had it
that the old general himself had determined to take the field and was on his way to Gate City.
It was possibly to escort him and his staff the troop was ordered kept prepared to move at
a moment's notice. On Burleigh's desk was a batch of telegrams from Department Headquarters.
Two came in during their long conference in the afternoon, and the quartermaster had lowered
his hand long enough from that lurid welt on his sallow cheek to hurriedly write two or three
in reply. One Folsom felt sure was sent in cipher. Two days before, Burleigh had urged him
to protest as vehemently as he could against the sending of any money or any small detachment
up to the Big Horn, and protested he had strenuously. Two days before, Burleigh said it was
as bad as murder to order a paymaster or disbursing officer to the Hills with anything less
than a battalion to escort him, and yet within four hours after he was put in possession of
nearly all the paper currency in the local bank a secret order was issued sending Lieutenant
Dean with ten picked men to slip through the passes to the Platte, away from the beaten road,
and up to ten P.M. Dean himself was kept in ignorance of his further destination or the purpose
of his going. Not until half-past ten was a sealed package placed in his hands by the post
quartermaster, who had himself received it from Major Burleigh and then and there the young
officer was bidden by Colonel Stevens, as the medium of the department commander, to ride with
all haste commensurate with caution, to ford the Sweetwater above its junction with the Platte,
to travel by night if need be and hide by day if he could, to let no man or woman know the
purpose of his going or the destination of his journey, but to land that package safe at Warrior
Gap before the moon should wane.

And all this Burleigh must have known when he, John Folsom, shook his hand at parting after
tea that evening, and had then gone hopefully to drive his girls to Emory to see his soldier
boy, and found him busy with the sudden orders, received not ten minutes before their coming.
Something in Burleigh's almost tremulous anxiety to get that money in the morning, his ill-disguised
chagrin at Folsom's refusal, something in the eagerness with which, despite the furious denunciation
of the moment before, he jumped at Folsom's offer to put up the needed money if he would withhold
the threatened charges--all came back to the veteran now and had continued to keep him thinking
during the night. Could it be that Burleigh stood in need of all this money to cover other
sums that he had misapplied? Could it be that he had planned this sudden sending of young Dean
on a desperate mission in revenge that he could not take officially? There were troops at Frayne
going forward in strong force within the week. There were other officers within call, a dozen
of them, who had done nowhere near the amount of field service performed by Dean. He, a troop
commander just in from long and toilsome marches and from perilous duty, had practically been
relieved from the command of his troop, told to take ten men and run the gauntlet through the
swarming Sioux. The more Folsom thought the more he believed that he had grave reason for his
suspicion, and reason equally grave for calling on the quartermaster for explanation. He reached
the corral gate. It was locked, but a little postern in the stockade let him through. One or
two sleepy hands appeared about the stables, but the office was deserted. Straight to Burleigh's
quarters he went and banged at the door. It took three bangs to bring a servant.

"I wish to see your master at once. Tell him I am here," and as the servant slowly shambled
up the stairs, Folsom entered the sitting-room. A desk near the window was open and its contents
littered about. The drawers in a heavy bookcase were open and papers were strewn upon the floor.
The folding doors to the dining-room were open. Decanters, goblets, cigar stumps and heel taps
were scattered over the table. Guest or host, or both, had left things in riotous shape. Then
down came the servant, a scared look in his eyes.

"The major isn't in, sir. His bed hasn't been occupied, an' the captain's gone, too. Their
uniforms are there, though."

Five minutes later, on a borrowed horse, John Folsom was galloping like mad for home. A door
in the high board fence at the rear of his house shot open just as he was darting through the
lane that led to the stable. A woman's form appeared in the gap--the last thing that he saw
for a dozen hours, for the horse shied violently, hurling the rider headlong to the ground.

CHAPTER XVI.

At three o'clock in the morning, while the stars were still bright in the eastern sky, the
little party of troopers, Dean at the irhead, had ridden away from the twinkling lights of
camp, and long before sunrise had crossed the first divide to the north, and alternating trot,
lope and walk had put miles between them and Fort Emory before the drums of the infantry beat
the call for guard mounting.

At ten o'clock the party halted under some spreading willows, deep in a cleft of the bold,
high hills that rolled away toward the Sweetwater valley. Horses were unsaddled and picketed
out to graze. A little cook fire was started close to the spring that fed the tiny brook, trickling
away down the narrow ravine, and in a few moments the aroma of coffee and of appetizing slices
of bacon greeted the welcoming nostrils of the hungry men. The sun that had risen clear and
dazzling was now obscured by heavy masses of clouds, and time and again Dean cast anxious eyes
aloft, for a storm seemed sweeping eastward from the distant Wahsatch range, and long before
the little command had dived downward from the heights into the depths of this wild, romantic
and contracted valley, all the rolling upland toward Green River, far to the west, lay under
the pall of heavy and forbidding banks of hurrying vapor. Coffee and breakfast finished, Dean
climbed the steep bluff overhanging the spring, a faithful sergeant following, and what he
saw was sufficient to determine immediate action.

"Saddle up. We'll push ahead at once."

For an instant the veteran trooper looked dissent, but discipline prevailed.

"The lieutenant knows that Carey's not in yet," he ventured to say, as he started back down
the narrow game trail which they had climbed.

"Yes; but yonder he comes and so does the storm. We can't be caught in this cañon in case of
a hard rain. Let Carey have some coffee and a bite, if he feels well enough. Then we'll push on."

Ordinarily when making summer marches over the range, the first "water camp" on the Sweetwater
trail was here at Cañon Springs. On the road to Frayne, which crossed the brook ten miles to
the east, all wagon trains and troops not on forced march made similar camp. In the case of
scouting detachments or little parties sent out from Emory, it was always customary to spend
the first night and make the first camp on the Box Elder at furthermost, then to push on, ready
and refreshed, the following day. Dean well knew that to get the best work out of his horses
he should start easily, and up to nine o'clock he had fully intended to make the usual camp
at the Springs. But once before, within a few years, a big scouting party camping in the gorge
of the Box Elder had been surprised by one of those sudden, sweeping storms, and before they
could strike tents, pack up and move to higher ground, the stream took matters into its own
hands and spared them all further trouble on that score, distributing camp and garrison equipage
for long leagues away to the east. Two miles back, trooper Carey, who had been complaining
of severe cramp and pain in the stomach, begged to be allowed to fall out and rest awhile.
He was a reliable old soldier when whisky was not winning the upper hand, and this time whisky
was not at fault. A dose of Jamaica ginger was the only thing their field pharmacopoeia provided,
and Carey rolled out of his saddle and doubled up among the rocks with his hands on the pit
of his stomach, grimacing.

"Go back if you think best, or come ahead and catch us at the Springs if well enough," were
the orders left him, while the men pushed on, and now, as the lieutenant said, Carey was coming
himself. Some of the party were already dozing when the sergeant's sharp order "Saddle up"
was given, but a glance at the lowering sky explained it all, and every man was standing to
horse and ready when the missing trooper came jogging in among them, white, peaked, but determined.
A look of mingled disappointment and relief appeared on his face as he saw the preparations
for the start, but his only comment was, "I can make it, sir," as he saluted his young commander.
Less than two hours from the time they unsaddled, therefore, the troopers once more mounted,
and, following their leader, filed away down the winding gorge. Presently there came the low
rumble of thunder, and a sweep of the rising wind. "Trot," said Dean, and without other word
the little column quickened the pace.

The ravine grew wider soon and far less tortuous, but was still a narrow and dangerous spot.
For a mile or two from the Springs its course was nearly east of north, then it bore away to
the northeast, and the Sweetwater trail abruptly left it and went winding up a cleft in the
hills to the west. Just as they reached this point the heavens opened and the clouds descended
in a deluge of rain. Out came the ponchos, unstrapped from the saddle, and every man's head
popped through the slit as the shiny black "shedwater" settled down on his shoulders.

"That outfit behind us will get a soaking if it has been fool enough to follow down to the
Springs," said Carey to the sergeant, as they began the pull up the slippery trail.

"What outfit?" asked Dean, turning in the saddle and looking back in surprise.

A blinding flash of lightning, followed almost on the instant by the crack and roar of thunder,
put summary stop to talk of any kind. Men and horses bowed their heads before the deluge and
the rain ran in streams from the manes and tails. The ascending path turned quickly into a
running brook and the black forms of steeds and riders struggled sidewise up the grass-grown
slopes in search of higher ground. The heavens had turned inky black. The gloomy ravine grew
dark as night. Flash after flash the lightning split the gloom. Every second or two trooper
faces gleamed ghastly in the dazzling glare, then as suddenly vanished. Horses slipped or stumbled
painfully and, man after man, the riders followed the example of the young soldier in the lead
and, dismounting, led their dripping beasts farther up the steep incline. Halfway to the summit,
peering through the wind-swept sheets of rain, a palisaded clump of rocks jutted out from the
heights and, after a hard climb, the little band found partial shelter from the driving storm,
and huddled, awe-stricken, at their base. Still the lightning played and the thunder cannonaded
with awful resonance from crag to crag down the deep gorge from which they had clambered, evidently
none too soon, for presently, far down the black depths, they could see the Box Elder, under
a white wreath of foam, tearing in fury down its narrow bed.

"Beg pardon, lieutenant," shouted the veteran sergeant in the young commander's ear, even in
that moment never forgetting the habitual salute, "but if I didn't see the reason for that
sudden order to saddle I more than see it now. We would have been drowned like rats down there
in the gulch."

"I'm wondering if anybody has drowned like rats," shouted Dean, in reply. "Carey says another
party was just behind us. Who could they be?"

But for answer came another vivid, dazzling flash that for an instant blinded all eyes. "By
God! but that's a stunner!" gasped a big trooper, and then followed the deafening bang and
crash of the thunder, and its echoes went booming and reverberating from earth to heaven and
rolling away, peal after peal, down the bluff-bound cañon. For a moment no other sound could
be heard; then, as it died away and the rain came swashing down in fresh deluge, Carey's voice
overmastered the storm.

"That's struck something, sir, right around yonder by the Springs. God help that outfit that
came a-gallopin' after me!"

"What was it? Which way were they coming?" Dean managed to ask.

"Right along the bluff, sir, to the east. Seemed like they was ridin' over from the old camp
on the Frayne road. There was twenty-five or thirty of 'em, I should say, coming at a lope."

"Cavalry?" asked Dean, a queer look in his face.

"No, sir. They rode dispersed like. They was a mile away when I sighted them, and it was gittin'
so black then I don't think they saw me at all. They were 'bout off yonder, half a mile east
of the Springs when I dipped down into the ravine, and what seemed queer was that two of them
galloped to the edge, dismounted, and were peering down into the gorge like so many Indians,
just as though they didn't want to be seen. I was goin' to tell the lieutenant 'bout it first
thing if I had found our fellows off their guard, but you were all mounted and just starting."

Instinctively Dean put forth his hand under the dripping poncho and tugged at the straps of
his off saddle-bag. No need for dread on that score. The bulky package, wrapped, sealed and
corded, was bulging out of the side of his field pouch till it looked as though he had crammed
a cavalry boot into its maw.

"Thirty men--mounted?--no wagons or--anything?" he anxiously asked.

"Full thirty, sir, and every man armed with rifle as far as I could see," said Carey, "and
if it was us they was after, they'd have had us at their mercy down in that pocket at the Springs."

A shout from one of the men attracted the attention of the leaders. The storm had spent its
force and gone rolling away eastward. The thunder was rumbling far over toward the now invisible
crest of the Black Hills of Wyoming. The rain sheets had given place to trickling downpour.
A dim light was stealing into the blackness of the gorge. Louder and fiercer roared the Box
Elder, lashing its banks with foam. And then came the cry again.

"I tell you it is, by God! for there goes another!"

All eyes followed the direction of the pointing finger. All eyes saw, even though dimly, the
saddled form of a horse plunging and struggling in the flood, making vain effort to clamber
out, then whirling helplessly away--swept out of sight around the shoulder of bluff, and borne
on down the tossing waves of the torrent. Men mean no irreverence when they call upon their
Maker at such times, even in soldier oath. It is awe, not blasphemy.

"By God, lieutenant, that's what we'd a been doing but for your order." It was the sergeant
who spoke.

And at that very hour there was excitement at Fort Emory. At eight o'clock the colonel was
on his piazza looking with gloomy eyes over the distant rows of empty barracks. The drum-major
with the band at his heels came stalking out over the grassy parade, and the post adjutant,
girt with sash and sword-belt, stood in front of his office awaiting the sergeant-major, who
was unaccountably delayed. Reduced to a shadow, the garrison at Fort Emory might reasonably
have been excused, by this time, from the ceremony of mounting a guard, consisting practically
of ten privates, three of whom wore the cavalry jacket; but old "Pecksniff" was determined
to keep up some show of state. He could have no parade or review, but at least he could require
his guard to be mounted with all the pomp and ceremony possible. He would have ordered his
officers out in epaulets and the full dress "Kossuth" hat of the period, but epaulets had been
discarded during the war and not yet resumed on the far frontier. So the rank and file alone
were called upon to appear in the black-feathered oddity a misguided staff had designed as
the headgear of the array. "Pecksniff's" half-dozen doughboys, therefore, with their attendant
sergeants and corporals in the old fashioned frock and felt, and a still smaller squad of troopers
in yellow-trimmed jackets and brass-mounted forage caps, were drawn up at the edge of the parade
awaiting the further signal of adjutant's call, while the adjutant himself swore savagely and
sent the orderly on the run for the sergeant-major. When that clock-governed functionary was
missing something indeed must be going wrong.

Presently the orderly came running back.

"Sergeant Dineen isn't home, sir, and his wife says he hasn't been back since the lieutenant
sent him in town with the last dispatch."

"Tell the first sergeant of "B" Company, then, to act as sergeant-major at once," said the
adjutant, and hurried over to his colonel. "Dineen's not back, sir," he reported at the gate.
"Can anything be wrong?"

"I ordered him to bring with him the answer to my dispatch to the general, who wired to me
from the railway depot at Cheyenne. Probably he's been waiting for that, and the general's
away somewhere. We ought to have an operator here day and night," said Pecksniff petulantly.
But the irritation in his eyes gave way to anxiety when at that moment the sutler's buggy was
seen dashing into the garrison at headlong speed, his smart trotter urged almost to a run.
Griggs reined up with no little hard pulling at the colonel's gate, and they could see a dozen
yards off that his face was pale.

"Have you any idea, colonel," he began the moment the officers reached him, "where Major Burleigh
can be? He left the depot somewhere about three o'clock this morning with that Captain Newhall.
He hasn't returned and can't be found. Your sergeant-major was waylaid and robbed some time
after midnight, and John Folsom was picked up senseless in the alley back of his house two
hours ago. What does it all mean?"

CHAPTER XVII.

That storm-burst along the range had turned for twenty-four hours every mountain stream into
a foaming torrent for a hundred miles. Not a bridge remained along the Platte. Not a ford was
fordable within two days' march of either Emory or Frayne. Not a courier crossed the Box Elder,
going either way, until the flood went down, and then it transpired that a tide in the affairs
of men had also turned, and that there was trouble ahead for some who had thought to find plain
sailing. For two days watchers along the lower Box Elder dragged out upon the shallows the
bodies of horses that once upon a time might have borne the "U. S." brand, but were not girthed
with cavalry saddles now. Nor were there lacking other bodies to prove that the victims of
the sudden storm were not Uncle Sam's men, much as two, at least, of the drowned had been wanted
by Federal authorities but a week before. What the denizens of Gate City and Fort Emory dreaded
and expected to bear was that Dean and his little party had been caught in the trap. But, living
or dead, not a sign of them remained along the storm-swept ravine. What most people of Gate
City and Fort Emory could not understand was the evidence that a big gang of horse thieves,
desperadoes and renegades had suddenly appeared about the new town, had spurred away northward
in the night, had kept the Frayne road till they reached the Box Elder, riding hard long after
sun-up, and there, reinforced, they had gone westward to the Sweetwater trail, and, old frontiersmen
though they were, had been caught in the whirl of water at Cañon Springs, losing two of their
number and at least a dozen of their horses. What could have lured them into that gloomy rift
at such a time? What inspiration had led Dean out of it?

Singly or in little squads, many of them afoot, bedraggled, silent, chagrined, the "outfit,"
described by Trooper Carey had slunk away from the neighborhood of the Box Elder as soon as
the storm subsided. Solemnly, as befitted soldiers, silent and and alert despite their dripping
accoutrements, the little detachment of cavalry had pushed ahead, riding by compass over the
drenched uplands, steering for the Sweetwater. Late in the afternoon the skies had cleared,
the sun came out, and they camped in a bunch of cottonwoods on the old Casper trail and slept
the sleep of the just and the weary. Early next day they hastened on, reaching the usually
shallow stream, with Devil's Gate only a few miles away, before the setting of a second sun.
Here they feasted and rested well, and before the dawn was fairly red on the third day out
from Emory they were breasting the turbid waters and by noon had left the valley far to the
south and were well out toward the Big Horn country, where it behooved them to look warily
ahead, for from every ridge, though far to the west of their probable raiding ground, Dean
and his men could expect to encounter scouting parties of the Indians at any moment, and one
false step meant death.

The third night passed without alarm, though every eye and ear was strained. The morning of
the fourth day dawned and the sun soon tinged the misty mountain tops to the far north, and
Dean saw before him an open rolling country, over which it would be impossible to march without
attracting Indian eyes, if Indian eyes there were within twenty miles. And with proper caution
he ordered his men to keep in concealment, horses grazing under guard in a deep depression
near a stream, men dozing soundly by turns until the twilight came, and then the stars--their
night lights for a long, long march. Dawn of the fifth day found them huddled in a deep ravine
of the southern foothills, with Warrior Gap not thirty miles away, and now, indeed, was prudence
necessary, for the faint light showed the fresh prints of innumerable pony hoofs on every side.
They were close on Machpealota's lurking braves. Which would see the other first?

It must have been somewhere toward five o'clock in the afternoon that Dean, searching with
his field glass the sunlit slopes far out to the east, heard the voice of his sergeant close
at hand and turned to answer. Up to this moment, beyond the pony tracks, not a sign had they
seen of hostile Indians, but the buffalo that had appeared in scattered herds along their line
of march were shy and scary, and old hands said that that meant they had recently been hunted
hard. Moreover, this was not a section favored of the buffalo. There was much alkali and sage
brush along their trail, and only here and there in scanty patches any of the rich, nutritious
bunch grass which the roving animals so eagerly sought. The day had been hot and almost cloudless.
The shimmer of heat along the lazy roll of the land to the south had often baffled their blinking
eyes. But now the sun was well to the west, and the refraction seemed diminishing, and away
over to the northeast a dull-colored cloud seemed slowly rising beyond the ridges. It was this
that Sergeant Bruce was studying when he murmured to his young commander:

"I think that means a big herd on the run, sir, and if so Indians started them."

One or two troopers, dozing close at hand, sprawled full length upon the ground, with their
faces buried in, or hidden by, their blue-sleeved arms, slowly rolled over and came crouching
up alongside. Dean dropped his glasses and peered in the direction indicated by his comrade
of humbler rank. Dust cloud it was beyond a doubt, and a long peep through the binocular proved
that it was slowly sailing across the horizon in a northerly direction. Did that mean that
the red hunters were driving the great quarry toward the village of the Sioux, or that the
young men were out in force, and with the full complement of squaws and ponies, were slaughtering
on the run. If the former, then Dean and his party would be wise to turn eastward and cross
the trail of the chase. If the latter they would stand better chance of slipping through to
the Gap by pushing northward, deeper in among the pine-crested heights.

Behind the watchers, well down in the ravine, the horses were placidly nibbling at the scant
herbage, or lazily sprawling in the sun, each animal securely hoppled, and all carefully guarded
by the single trooper, whose own mount, ready saddled, circled within the limits of the stout
lariat, looped about his master's wrist. All spoke of caution, of lively sense of danger and
responsibility, for they of the little detachment were picked men, who had ridden the warpath
too long not to realize that there was no such thing as trusting to luck in the heart of the
Indian country, especially when Machpealota with his Ogallalla braves was out for business.
The cautious movements of the group along the bank had quickly been noted by the wakeful ones
among the troopers, and presently the entire party, excepting only the herd guard, had crouched
up alongside, and with the comradeship born of such perilous service, were now discussing the
situation in low, confidential tones.

For half an hour they lay there, studying the signs to the northeast. The dun colored cloud
hung low over the earth for a distance of several miles. The herd was evidently one of unusual
size even for those days when the buffalo swarmed in countless thousands, and finally the sergeant
spoke again.

"It's a big hunt, lieutenant. Whatever may be going on about the Gap they've found time to
send out young men enough to round up most of the buffalo north of the Platte and drive them
in toward the mountains. It's combining pleasure with business. They don't feel strong enough
in number, perhaps, to make another attempt on troops armed with breech-loaders, so while they're
waiting until their reinforcements come, or their own breech-loaders, they are herding the
buffalo where they can get them when they want them later on. We are in big luck that no stragglers
are anywhere around us; if they were it wouldn't take such fellows long to spy us out."

Dean swept the ridge line with his glass. No sign of life nearer than that far-away, betraying
dust cloud. No symptom of danger anywhere within their ken. He was thinking at the moment of
that precious package in his saddle-bags and the colonel's words impressing him with the sense
of responsibility the night they parted at Fort Emory. To-morrow, by sunrise, if fortune favored
him, he could turn it over to the commanding officer at the new stockade, and then if the Indians
were not gathered in force about the post and actually hostile, he could slip out again at
night and make swift dash for the Platte and the homeward way, and then within the week rejoin
his sister at Fort Emory--his sister and "Pappoose." Never before had the Indian pet name carried
such significance as now. Night and day those soft, dark eyes--that beautiful face--haunted
his thoughts and filled his young heart with new and passionate longing. It was hard to have
to leave the spot her presence made enchanted ground. Nothing but the spur of duty, the thrill
of soldier achievement and stirring venture could have reconciled him to that unwelcome order.

In one week now, if fortune favored and heaven spared, he could hope to look again into the
eyes that had so enchained him, but if there should interpose the sterner lot of the frontier,
if the Sioux should learn of his presence, he who had thwarted Burning Star and the brothers
of poor Lizette in their schemes of vengeance, he at whose door the Ogallallas must by this
time have laid the death of one of their foremost braves, then indeed would there be no hope
of getting back without a battle royal. There was only one chance of safety--that the Indians
should not discover their presence. If they did and realized who the intruders were, Jessie
Dean might look in vain for her brother's return. Pappoose would never hear the love words
that, trembling on his lips the night he left her, had been poured out only to that unresponsive
picture. Two ways there were in which the Indians could know of his presence. One by being
informed through some half-breed spy, lurking about Frayne; but then who would be dastard enough
to send such word? The other by being seen and recognized by some of the Ogallalla band, and
thus far he believed they had come undetected, and it was now after five o'clock--after five
o'clock and all was well. In a few hours they could again be on their starlit way. With the
morrow they should be safely within the gates of the new stockade at Warrior Gap.

Turning with hope and relief in his face to speak to Sergeant Bruce, who lay there at his elbow,
he saw the blue-sleeved arm stretching forth in warning to lie low, and with grave eyes the
veteran was gazing straight at a little butte that rose from the rolling surface not more than
half a mile away to the southeast.

"Lieutenant," he whispered, "there are Indians back of that hill at this minute, and it isn't
buffalo they're laying for."

Dean was brave. He had been tried and his mettle was assured, and yet he felt the sudden chill
that coursed his veins. "How can they have seen us," he murmured.

"May have struck our trail out to the southwest," said Bruce slowly, "or they may have been
told of our coming and are stalking us. They've got a heavy score to settle with this troop,
you know."

For a moment only the breathing of the little party could be heard. All eyes were fixed upon
the distant mound. At last Dean spoke again.

"When did you see them first and how many are there?"

"Near ten minutes ago. I saw something fluttering swift along the sky line just beyond that
divide to the south. It skimmed like a bird, all but the quick bobbing up and down that made
me sure there was a galloping pony under it. Then another skimmed along. It was the bunch of
feathers and red flannel on their lances, and my belief is that they struck our trail back
here somewhere, and that there's only a small party, and they don't know just who we are and
they want to find out."

"You're right. Look!" was Dean's sudden answer, for at the very instant there rode boldly,
calmly into full view two young Indians, who with cool deliberation came jogging on at gentle
speed, straight toward the concealed bivouac of the troopers. Instantly Bruce reached for his
carbine, and two or three of the men went sliding or crouching backward down the slope as though
in quest of their arms. Full eight hundred yards away were the riders at the moment, coming
side by side in apparent unconcern.

"Don't," muttered Dean, with hand outstretched. "They look anything but hostile."

"That's when they're most likely to be full of hell, sir," was the prompt answer. "See! others
are watching behind that knoll," and indeed as Bruce declared, a feather-decked head or two
could be detected through the glass, peering over the summit.

"Warn them to halt, then," cried Dean. "But we cannot fire unless they provoke it."

Bruce was on his feet in a second. Standing erect and facing straight toward the coming pair,
he raised his right hand, palm to the front, to the full length of his arm, and slowly motioned
"stand." Every plainsman knows the signal. In well-acted surprise, the Indians reined their
ponies flat back, and, shading their eyes with their hands a moment, remained motionless. Then,
as with one accord, each tossed aside his rifle, and one of them further lifted high and displayed
a revolver. This, too, he tossed out on the turf, and now with both arms bare and extended
on high, with empty hands outspread, they slowly advanced as though saying "See, we are without
arms. We come as brothers."

But the sergeant never hesitated. Almost on tiptoe he repeated the signal "halt," and half-turned
imploringly to his officer.

"It's all a bluff, sir. They want to crawl upon us, see who and how many we are. Let some of
us fire warning shots or come they will, and the moment they find out who we are, away they'll
ride to bring Red Cloud and all his bucks about our ears."

"I cannot fire," was the answer. "That's their flag of truce and we must not ignore it. Let
them come, sergeant; I'll meet them."

CHAPTER XVIII.

Remonstrance on part of his men would have been a violation of their rules of order. Obedient
to the lieutenant's instructions, Sergeant Bruce, with evident reluctance, lowered his hand.
Whoever these Indians were they well understood the principles that governed civilized warfare.
They well knew that the white soldiers would respect a flag of truce, though in their own vernacular
they referred to the sacred emblem only as a "fool flag," and sometimes used it, as did the
Modocs five years later, to lure officers into ambush and deliberately murder them. They knew
the white soldiers would take no advantage of foemen gathered for a conference or parley, and
thus far the Sioux themselves had observed the custom which the Modocs basely violated when
in cold blood they slaughtered General Canby and the peace commissioners sent to treat with
them. Confidently, therefore, came the two young warriors, but as Dean raised himself from
the ground and was about to step forward, the sergeant spoke:

"Beg pardon, sir, but these fellows know all our officers. They would recognize you at once.
The word would go to Red Cloud faster than any pony could gallop. Let me meet them, or let
one of the men."

The ponies were coming at the lope now, and not an instant was to be lost. The safety of his
command might possibly depend on their not being recognized as of the troop before whose carbines
Chaska, brother to Lizette, had met his death.

"Perhaps you're right," said Dean. "Halt them again. Conroy, you go with Sergeant Bruce."

Eagerly a young trooper, carbine in hand, sprang up and stood by the sergeant's side as the
latter repeated his warning signal. Obediently, yet not too promptly, showing evident desire
to get where they could peer over into the ravine and count the number of the white men and
horses, the Indians again drew rein, this time barely one hundred yards away. Then Bruce and
Conroy, holding up their emptied hands, strode forward along the grassy slope, making the further
sign, "Dismount."

In those days few of our cavalry wore, when on Indian campaign, the forage-cap with its crossed
sabres and distinguishing letters. Nothing in the dress or accoutrements of the two men thus
advancing to meet the Indian emissaries would give to the latter any clew as to the troop or
regiment to which they belonged. Could they see the horses, however, the matter would be settled
at once. The U. S. brand, with that of the number of the regiment and letter of the troop showed
on every cavalry mount in the service, and the Ogallallas knew the earmarks of two, at least,
of our cavalry regiments in '68 as well as they did the cut of their own hair. But in the modesty
of the non-commissioned officer Bruce had underrated his own prominence in Indian eyes. Not
only did these keen observers know every officer by sight, and have for him some distinguishing
name of their own, but many a trooper, easily singled out from his fellows because of his stature,
or the color of his hair, or some other physical peculiarity, was as well known as his captain
or lieutenant, and Bruce, ex-trooper of the Scots Greys, and now a model sergeant of Yankee
cavalry, was already a marked man in the eyes of the southern Sioux. Brulé, Minneconjou and
Ogallalla knew him well--his aquiline beak, to which the men would sometimes slyly allude,
having won him the Indian appellative of Posh Kopee or Big Nose.

Before the two parties came within fifty yards of each other, therefore, watchers along the
ravine saw the quick exchange of significant glances between the young braves. "Twig that?"
whispered Trooper Blaine, in low, emphatic tone. "Those fellows know 'Scotty' just as well
as we do."

All the same, leaving their trained ponies to nibble at the scanty bunch grass, the two came
straight forward with extended hands and cordial "How, colah!" on their lips, one of them adding,
in agency English, "Want talk chief. Indian poor. Heap sick." (And here he clasped his stomach
with both hands.) "Want coffee, sugar, bread."

"All right," said Bruce promptly, noting the while how the roving black eyes searched the edge
of the ravine. "Stay here. Don't come nearer. You got buffalo meat?"

A grunt was the reply of one, a guttural "Buffalo, yes," the answer of the other.

"Bring tongues, then," and Bruce touched his own. "Five," and he threw forward the outspread
right hand, rapidly touching in succession the thumb and four fingers. "We give both hands
full--coffee, sugar, hardtack," and Bruce illustrated as he spoke. "That's all!" he finished
abruptly, with the well-known Indian sign that plainly tells "I have spoken--there is nothing
more to say," then calmly turned his back and, bidding Conroy follow, started to return to
his comrades at the ravine.

But Indian diplomacy was unsatisfied. The Sioux had found "Big Nose" to be one of the soldiers
in the field. He, at least, was of the hated troop that fought and chased Burning Star and
killed Chaska. The trail told them there were nearly a dozen in the party, all on shod horses,
with two in lead-spare mounts or pack-horses, doubtless--so they had extra rations and had
come far; but why were they going this way, so far west of the usual road to the Big Horn posts?
Why were they so few in number? Where were the rest? Why were they hiding here in the ravine,
instead of marching? Answer to this last question was easy enough. It was to keep out of sight
of Indian eyes and needed no excuse. There was something behind this mysterious presence of
ten or twelve soldiers in the southern foothills, and Machpealota would expect of his scouts
full information, hence the instant movement on the part of one of the two braves to follow.

Impressively, Bruce turned again and waved him back. "Go, get buffalo tongue," said he, "or
no trade. Keep away from our tepees," and he drew with his spurred boot-heel a jagged line
across the turf. "Your side," said he, indicating the slope to the southeast of the line. "This--ours.
That's all!" And this time the Indian knew he must come no nearer.

"I've got 'em talking trade, lieutenant," reported Bruce, the instant he reached Dean's side.
"We don't need the tongues, but we've got more coffee and sugar than we are apt to want, and
at least we can keep them interested until dark, then we can slip away. Of course, they've
sent word to their main body that we're over here, but I believe they can't come in force before
night."

"They knew you, sergeant, and they know it is probably our troop," said he. "There must be
only a small party near us. Make your trade, but while you're doing it we'll saddle. I mean
to get out of this and into the thick of the timber before they can surround us. Stand 'em
off, now, while we get ready."

Promises must be kept when made to an Indian, even if they are otherwise sometimes broken.
In ten minutes, with coffee, sugar and hardtack in their hands, the sergeant and his comrades
were back at the front. One brave was still there, the other had vanished. Five minutes, neither
party saying a word, the troopers waited; then Bruce turned to Conroy. "I knew they had nothing
to trade. Take this sack with you and fall back. Tell our fellows to keep me well covered till
I follow." The instant the soldier started with the sack swung over his shoulder, the Indian,
who had been squatted on the turf, sprang up and began rapid expostulation in fluent Ogallalla.
"It's no use, young man," interposed Bruce. "Your chum there has no buffalo tongues, and he
knew it. Here's some hardtack for you," and he spread one liberally with sugar and handed it
to the ever-receptive paw, outstretched to grasp it. A glance over the shoulder showed that
Conroy was nearly at the edge. Then, quietly, Bruce, too, began to retire. He had not got ten
paces, still facing his unwelcome visitor, when the Indian gave a shrill, sudden cry and tossed
up his hands. Not a second too soon Bruce turned and darted for cover. The Indian flung himself
flat on the turf and rolled away into a depression where he could find partial shelter from
bullets from the ravine, whence he evidently looked for them, and out from behind the knoll,
bridles held high, "quirts" lashing at their ponies' flanks, darted half a dozen painted savages,
tearing down upon the spot at the top speed of their agile mounts. Only two men remained on
watch at the moment, Dean and one trooper. Most of the others, already in saddle, were filing
away up the game trail that threaded the windings of the ravine, the two lead horses with them,
while a few yards behind the young officer and his comrade, halfway down the reverse slope,
two others, afoot, handled the reins of their own horses and those of the lieutenant and men
still held at the edge. It was an exciting moment. Bruce had only a hundred yards to run before
he could get under cover, and there was no chance of their hitting him at that range, yet a
puff of smoke rose from the knoll, and a bullet, nearly spent, came tumbling and singing up
the turf, and the dashing warriors, yelling wildly, applauded the shot. Bruce took matters
coolly. Leaping behind the shelter of the ledge, he reached for his carbine, and in a moment
more, as the pursuing Indians came lashing within long range, four seasoned cavalry carbines,
each with a keen eye at the sight and a steady finger at the trip, were leveled on the coming
foe. Dean's young heart beat hard, it must be owned, for hitherto the Indians had been fighting
in retreat or on the defensive, while now they came as though confident of success; but there
was soldier exultation and something like savage joy mingling with the thrill of excitement.

"There's more behind those beggars, sir," growled Conroy, a veteran at Indian work, "but they'll
sheer off when they get within three hundred yards." On they came, shields and lances dangling,
ponies on the keen jump, feathers and pennons streaming on the wind. But, just as Conroy said,
no sooner was Bruce safely under cover and they felt themselves drawing within dangerous range
than, fan-like, they opened out to right and left, and, yelling still like fiends, veered in
wide circle from their line of attack, and ducking over their ponies' shoulders, clinging with
one leg to the upright part of the cantle, they seemed to invite the fire of their white foe--and
got it. A daring fellow in the lead came streaking slantwise across the front, as though aiming
to pick up the comrade lurking in the dip of the prairie-like slope, and Conroy's carbine was
the first to bark, followed almost instantly by Dean's. The scurrying pony threw up his wall-eyed
head and lashed with his feathered tail, evidently hit, but not checked, for under the whip
he rushed gamely on until another bullet, whistling within a foot of his neck, warned the red
rider that he was far too close for safety, for with halting gait the pony turned and labored
off the field, and presently was seen to be staggering. "Score one for our side," laughed the
Irishman, in glee. "Now's your time, sergeant."

But Bruce, reloading, was gazing sternly at the distant knoll. The other warriors, riding right
and left, were now chasing crosswise over the billowy slopes, keeping up a fire of taunt and
chaff and shrill war-cries, but never again venturing within three hundred yards--never wasting
a shot.

"I thought so," suddenly cried the sergeant. "They're signaling from the knoll. They never
would have attacked with so few, unless there were dozens more within sight. Now's our time,
lieutenant. We can mount and ride like hell to the timber--I beg your pardon, sir," he broke
off suddenly. "I didn't mean to say what the lieutenant should do."

"No apologies," laughed Dean, his eyes snapping with the vim of the fight. "Glad you see the
truth of what I said. Come on. Mount quickly, men."

Two minutes more and the entire party of blue-coats were spurring swiftly northward up the
winding gorge, the pack-horses lumbering alongside. Eagerly Dean and Bruce in the lead looked
right and left for a game trail leading up the slope, for well they knew that the moment their
reinforcements came the warriors would dash into the ravine and, finding their antagonists
fled, would pursue along the banks. It would never do to be caught in such a trap. A gallop
of a quarter of a mile and, off to the right, a branch ravine opened out to higher ground,
and into this the leaders dove and, checking speed, rode at the trot until the ascent grew
steep. Five minutes more and they were well up toward the head of the gulch and presently found
themselves nearly on a level with the hillsides about them. Here, too, were scattered pine-trees
and a few scrub-oak. The timber, then, was close at hand. Signaling halt to the climbing column,
Dean and Bruce, springing from saddle, scrambled up the bank to their right and peered cautiously
back down over the tumbling waves of the foothills, and what they saw was enough to blanch
the cheek of even veteran Indian fighters.

Far over to the east, beyond an intervening ridge and under the dun cloud of dust, the earth
was black for miles with herds of running buffalo. Far down to the southeast, here, there and
everywhere over the land, the slopes were dotted with little knots of Indian braves--they could
be nothing else--all riding like mad, coming straight toward them. Machpealota probably had
launched his whole force on the trail of the luckless troopers.

CHAPTER XIX.

That night there was rejoicing at the new stockade. For over a week not a courier had managed
to slip through in either direction. Alarmed for the safety of the little garrison, the commanding
officer of the post away up at the gorge of the Big Horn River had sent two troops of cavalry
to scout the slopes of the mountains and look into the state of affairs at Warrior Gap. They
found countless fresh pony tracks all along the foothills east of the Greasy Grass and in the
valleys of the many forks of the Deje Agie--the Crow name for Tongue River--but not an Indian
did they see. They marched in among the welcoming officers and men at the bustling post to
find themselves hailed as heroes. "We've been cut off from the world for at least ten days,"
said the commandant. "Our couriers have been killed, captured or driven back. Even our half-breed
scouts refuse to make further trial. They say Red Cloud's people cover the land in every direction.
Our woodchoppers only work under heavy guard. The contractors, freighters and workmen threaten
to strike unless they get their money. The sutler refuses them further credit. The quartermaster
has paid out every cent and says his requisition for ten thousand dollars was ordered filled,
and the money ought to have been here a week ago. All will have to stop if the money doesn't
come. We're safe enough. The Sioux don't dare come within range of our breech-loaders. But
we can't finish the barracks in time for winter at this rate."

A stout-hearted soldier was the commanding officer at Warrior Gap. He had with him now four
strong companies of infantry and a troop of horse. He had, he said, but one anxiety, so far
as holding the fort was concerned--some few of the officers and quite a number of the soldiers,
as has been told, were burdened with their wives and children. If these could only be moved
under strong guard to Frayne on the Platte, he could snap his fingers in the face of Red Cloud
and his whole gang until they too got breech-loaders. "It's only a question of time!" said
he. "Sooner or later the Interior Department will be fool enough to arm the redskins all over
the land with magazine rifles, and then there will be lively work for the war office. Any day,"
said he, further, "we may expect the coming of a whole regiment from the Platte posts, and
then Mr. Lo will have to light out. Meantime, if we hadn't this trouble about the workmen,
and could get rid of the women and children, we'd be all right."

So back to the Big Horn rode the squadron to report all safe at Warrior Gap, barring the blockade,
and almost on the same date out there started from Laramie, on the long march up the Platte
and over across the sage-covered deserts, a strong force of foot and dragoons; and up from
the Sweetwater, far to the southwest, came this venturesome little party of ten, bringing the
much-demanded money, and all the while, with his far-riding, far-seeing scouts in every direction,
Machpealota, perched in the mountains back of the building post, warily watched the dispositions
and daily work, and laid his plans accordingly. Not a warrior was permitted to show himself
near the stockade, but in a sleepless cordon, five miles out, they surrounded the Gap. Not
a messenger had managed to elude their vigilance by day, not one had succeeded in slipping
into the little camp by night. Yet, with every succeeding morn the choppers and fatigue parties
pushed farther out from the stockade, in growing sense of security, and the Indians let them come.

Full a week before the Laramie column could possibly reach the mountains, however, Red Cloud
was warned of their coming, their numbers, and composition--so many horse soldiers, so many
"heap walks." Unmolested, the squadron from Fort C. F. Smith, the Big Horn River post, was
permitted to retrace its steps. In fancied safety, born of confidence in that wonderful new
breech-loader, the little command at the Gap was lulled to indifference to their surroundings.
Then, sending large numbers of his young men to round up the buffalo toward the Platte, but
keeping still his stern and vengeful eye upon the prey almost at his feet, the red chief made
his final and fatal plans.

       *       *       *       *       *

There came a cloudless morning when the cavalry troop escorted a young officer up the rocky
heights to the west, finding everywhere indications of recent Indian occupancy, but not a redskin
barred their way. Without opposition of any kind, without so much as a glimpse of the foe,
were they permitted to climb to Signal Rock, and from that point, with powerful glasses, the
officers swept the glorious range of foothills, the deep valley of the Tongue, the banks of
the Piney and the Crazy Woman, the far-spreading upland prairie rolling away like some heaving
ocean suddenly turned to earth, east and southeast to the dim horizon, and there they saw,
or thought they saw, full explanation of their recent freedom from alarm of any kind. There
to the south, full thirty miles away, the land was overlaid by a dull, heavy, dun-colored cloud,
and traversed by black streaks or blotches that were recognized at once as running buffalo.
Red Cloud and his braves then were drawn away in search of other game, and, light of heart
and foot, the troopers trotted back to the waiting stockade, to meet there late that evening,
as the weird tattoo of the drums and fifes was echoing back from the rocky heights, the first
messenger through in nearly fifteen days-a half-breed Sioux from the distant posts along the
Platte, bearing a written message from the commanding officer at Frayne, which the veteran
commandant at Warrior Gap read with infinite comfort:

"Seven companies of infantry and three more troops of cavalry are on the way and should reach
you by Saturday week. The General seems thoroughly alive to the situation, and we, too, are
hoping for orders to move out and help you give that infernal old scoundrel the thrashing he
deserves. All has been quiet hereabouts since that one party made its dash on Hal Folsom's
ranch. Of course you know the story of Lizette, and of course Red Cloud must have known that
Burning Star was head devil in that enterprise, though Chaska was the victim. I take much comfort
in the fact that it was I who sent young Dean and his troop round by way of the Laramie. Folsom
and his people would have been murdered to a man if I hadn't, and yet I hear that absurd old
ass at Emory put Dean in arrest for not coming directly home. Pecksniff should have been retired
ten years ago--for imbecility.

"We had a tremendous storm in the mountains to the south two days ago, and a courier has just
galloped out from Emory, inquiring for news of Dean. It seems he was sent with a big sum in
currency for your quartermaster, and ordered to slip through by way of the Sweetwater, as Red
Cloud was known to be covering the direct road. Somehow it leaked out before he started, and
a gang of desperadoes gathered to jump him at Cañon Springs. The storm jumped them, for two
of their dead and a dozen horses were rolled out on the flats. Dean must have got through all
right, for Bat saw their trail fifteen miles above us. Of course, he'll have to make night
marches; but, unless Red Cloud gets wind of his coming and corrals him, he should reach you
almost as soon as this. Michel, the bearer, has your dispatches and orders. Retained copies
are here. Good luck, old man, and may we meet within the fortnight and wind up Red Cloud once
and for all time."

This was all, but more than enough. Riding night and day in wide détour, Michel had made his
way to the lately beleaguered spot, and what he brought was joyous news, indeed. Within the
coming week the post would have no more to fear. Within a day or two the contractors, then,
would have their money, and that would tap the sutler's stores and joy would reign supreme.
Enviously the soldiers eyed the artisans. Not for weeks could their paymaster be looked for,
while the funds for the civilians might reach them on the morrow, provided Red Cloud did not
interfere. He couldn't and wouldn't, said the commander, because he and his braves were all
off to the southeast, hunting buffalo. He could and might, said Michel that night at ten o'clock,
after taps had sent the garrison to bed, for by the time he left Frayne there were other riders
up from Gate City and all that garrison had learned that Lieutenant Dean was taking something
like fifty thousand dollars in greenbacks up to the Gap, with only ten men to guard it, and
Major Burleigh was wild with anxiety lest he shouldn't get through, and had been nearly crazy
since he heard of Dean's narrow escape at Cañon Springs. The officer of the day who heard this
story took it, with the teller, to the post commander, and that veteran sat up late and cross-questioned
long. Michel's English might be broken, but not his statement. The last arrival at Frayne before
he left was one of Major Burleigh's own men from Gate City. He said the General and his staff
were expected at Emory the next day, investigating matters, for old Stevens had got stampeded
because his sergeant-major was assaulted and old Mr. Folsom knocked out and a drunken captain
by the name of Newhall had been making trouble, and it had all told on Major Burleigh, who
had taken to his bed with nervous prostration.

So, while the garrison went to rest happy, the commanding officer waked long, and finally slept
soundly and might have slept late, but that just at dawn, full half an hour before the time
for reveille, there came a sharp knocking at the door of his log-hut, and the imperative voice
of the officer of the day.

"Colonel! colonel, I say! There's sharp firing out here in the hills to the south!"

The peaks to the west were just tinging with purple and red, reflected from the eastward sky,
and a faint light was beginning to steal down into the deep valley in which the cantonment
lay sleeping, when the veteran commander came hurrying out, half-dressed, and hied him, with
his attendant officer, to the southern angle of the stockade. There on the narrow ledge or
platform built under the sharp tops of the upright logs, were grouped the silent, grave-faced
guard, a dozen men intently listening. Thither presently came running others of the officers
or men, suddenly awakened by sense of something unusual going on. Far away among the wooded
heights to the south, echoing from the rocky palisades to the west, could be heard the pop,
pop of distant musketry, punctuated sometimes with louder bang as of large caliber rifles closer
at hand. Little time was there in which to hazard opinion as to the cause. One or two men,
faint-hearted at the thought of the peril of Indian battle and hopeful of influencing the judgment
of their superiors, began the murmur of "Big hunt," "Buffalo drive," etc., glancing furtively
at the colonel the while as though to observe the effect. But an imperative "Silence, you idiots!"
from the officer of the day put sudden end to their conjectures. Only a moment did the commander
listen. Then, quick and startling, came the order, "Sound to arms!" and within the minute the
stirring peal of the cavalry trumpet was answered by the hoarse thunder of the snare-drum,
beating the long roll. Out from their "dog tents" and half-finished log huts came the bewildered
men. Often as the alarm had sounded on the frontier there was a thrill and ring about it this
time that told of action close at hand. Out from the little huts, hurrying into their frock
coats and belting on their swords as they glared about them for the cause of the uproar, came
the officers, old and young, most of them veterans of many hard-fought fields of the war days--one
or two, only, youngsters fresh from the Point. At many a doorway and unglazed window appeared
the pallid faces of women and children, some of them weeping in mingled fright and distress.
In front of the log guardhouse the sergeant quickly formed the two reliefs not on post. On
their designated parades the companies rapidly fell in, while stern-voiced non-commissioned
officers rebuked the laggards and aided them into their belts, and each first sergeant took
rapid note of his men. No need to call the roll, a skulker would have been detected and kicked
into the ranks at the instant. Over under the rough board shelter of the quartermaster's employees
the workmen came tumbling out in shirt sleeves, many of them running to the nearest officer
and begging for a gun and a place in the fight, for now the firing was loud and lively. Down
by the swift-flowing stream the tethered horses of the cavalry plunged and neighed in excitement,
and the mules in the quartermaster's corral set up their irrepressible bray. For five minutes
there was clamor, but no confusion. Then disciplined silence reigned again, all but the nearing
volleying at the south. Presently, at rapid trot the cavalry, some fifty strong, came clattering
up the stony trail from the stream, and with carbines advanced disappeared through the main
gateway in a cloud of dust. Two companies were told off to man the loopholes of the stockade.
Two others under the command of a senior captain faced by the right flank, and in double-quick
time danced away in the wake of the cavalry. Eagerly the watchers climbed the wooden walls
or to the tower of the half-finished guardhouse, and, as the red light strengthened in the
east and the mountain sides became revealed, studied with their glasses or with straining eyes
the southward vista through the hills. They saw the troop form line to the front at the gallop
as it swept out over the open ground four hundred yards away, saw its flankers scurry to the
nearest shoulder of bluff, saw their excited signals and gesticulations, and presently a sheaf
of skirmishers shot forward from the advancing line and breasted the low ridge eight hundred
yards out from the fort, and then there came floating back the sound of ringing, tumultuous
cheer as the skirmishers reached the crest and darted headlong at some unseen object beyond,
and after them went the reserve, cheering too. And now the sound of firing became fierce and
incessant, and messengers came galloping back to the commander of the steadily advancing infantry,
and they, too, were seen to throw forward heavy skirmish lines and then resume the march. And
then, down over the ridge came a little knot of horsemen, made up of three men riding close
together, the outer ones supporting between them the comrade in the center. Before they were
within four hundred yards the young adjutant, gazing through his glasses at the colonel's side,
exclaimed: "It's Dean--dead or wounded!" and one of the surgeons rushed forward to meet the
party. "He's weak, sir, almost gone from loss of blood," exclaimed Trooper Conroy, himself
bleeding from a gash along the cheek. A faint smile drifted over the young fellow's pallid
face, as the adjutant, too, galloped up. A feeble hand indicated the bulging saddle pocket.
A faint voice faltered, "There's ten thousand dollars in that packet. We had to fight our way
through," and then the brave blue eyes closed and strong arms lifted the almost lifeless form
from the saddle as Marshall swooned away.

CHAPTER XX.

A day had dawned on the Big Horn never to be forgotten by those who watched the conflict from
the stockade, never to be recalled by those who went forth to fight. Broad daylight had come
and the sun was peeping over the far horizon as strong arms bore the unconscious officer within
the post, and the commander eagerly questioned the men who came with him. Their story was quickly
told. They had fled before overpowering numbers of the Sioux the night before, had made their
way through the timber in the darkness and come ahead all night, groping their way from ridge
to ridge until at the peep of day they found themselves in sight of familiar landmarks, and
could see the gleam of the waters of the Fork dancing away under the dawn. And then, as they
essayed to ride on they found the Indians all around them. Whichever way they turned the foe
appeared, but only in scattered parties and small numbers. Not once did more than half a dozen
appear in sight, and then confident of speedy succor from the fort, they had decided to make
a dash for it, and so rode boldly out into the open. But now a score of warriors popped up
and barred the way, while others far out at flank or rear kept up long range fire. One man
was shot through the body and fainted and had to be borne along. Then the lieutenant was shot
in the leg, but no one knew it until they saw his boot was running over with blood, and he
was growing ghastly white, even though he kept encouraging and directing. But when at last
the cavalry met them and brushed the Indians away from the front, Captain Drum, who rode at
their head, ordered Mr. Dean taken right into the post while he dashed on to punish the Sioux,
"and he is giving them hell, too," said the excited trooper, "for there couldn't have been
more than a hundred Indians all told."

Ah, not in sight, perhaps, poor lads!--not in sight of horse, foot or fort; for if there were
only a hundred, how came it that the fire grew fiercer still, and that presently every musket
in the infantry skirmish line, too, was blazing on the foe. By this time cavalry and infantry
both had disappeared over the curtaining ridge, and the colonel's face grew grave and haggard
as he listened. Three-fifths of his little garrison were out there battling against unknown
numbers. They had gone to rescue the detachment and bring it safely in. That rescue was accomplished.
The precious package for which so much had been risked was here--but what detained the command?
Why did they not return? Beyond doubt far more Indians were out there now than when first the
firing began. "Gallop out, Mr. Adjutant, and tell the major to withdraw his line and fall back
on the stockade," was the order--and with a lump in his throat the young officer mounted again
and started. He was a pet in the garrison, only in his second year of commission. They saw
him gallop through the gate, saw him ride gallantly straight for the curtaining ridge beyond
which the smoke was rising heavily now, saw him breasting the slope, his orderly following,
saw him almost reach it, and then suddenly the prairie seemed to jet fire. The foremost horse
reared, plunged, and went rolling over and over. They saw--plainly saw through their glasses,
and a shriek of agony and horror went up from among the women at the sight--half a dozen painted
savages spring out from behind the ledge, some on pony back, some afoot, and bear down on the
stricken form of the slender young rider now feebly striving to rise from the turf; saw the
empty hand outstretched, imploring mercy; saw jabbing lances and brandished war-clubs pinning
the helpless boy to earth and beating in the bared, defenseless head; saw the orderly dragged
from under his struggling horse and butchered by his leader's side; saw the bloody knives at
work tearing away the hot red scalps, then ripping off the blood-soaked clothing, and, to the
music of savage shouts of glee and triumph, hacking, hewing, mutilating the poor remains, reckless
of the bullets that came buzzing along the turf from the score of Springfields turned loose
at the instant among the loopholes of the stockade. It was eight hundred yards away in the
dazzling light of the rising sun. Old Springfields did not carry as do the modern arms. Soldiers
of those days were not taught accurate shooting as they are now. It was too far for anything
but chance, and all within a minute or two the direful tragedy was over, and the red warriors
had darted back behind the ridge from which they came.

"My God! sir," gasped the officer who stood at the side of the awe-stricken post commander,
"I believe it's Red Cloud's entire band, and they've got our poor boys surrounded! Can't we
send help?"

"Send help! Merciful heaven, man, who's to help us? Who's to protect these poor women and children
if we go? I have but two companies left. It's what those fiends are hoping--have been planning--that
I'll send out my last man to the aid of those already gone, and then they'll dart in on the
fort, and what will become of these?"

Great drops of sweat were pouring down the colonel's face as he turned and pointed to the huts
where now, clinging to one another in terror, many poor wives and children were gathered, and
the air was filled with the sobbing of the little ones. Up from the stockade came two young
officers, their faces set and rigid, their eyes blazing. "In God's name, colonel," cried the
foremost, "let me take my men and clear that ridge so that our people can get back. One charge
will do it, sir."

But solemnly the commander uplifted his hand. "Listen," said he, "the battle is receding. They
are driving our poor fellows southward, away from us. They are massed between them and us.
It would only be playing into their hands, my boy. It's too late to help. Our duty now is here."

"But good God, sir! I can't stay without raising a hand to help. I beg--I implore!"

"Go back to your post at once, sir. You may be needed any minute. Look there! Now!"

And as he spoke the colonel pointed to the southeast. Over the scene beyond the divide to the
south hung the bank of pale-blue smoke. Out on the slope lay the ghastly remains of the young
adjutant and his faithful comrade who, not ten minutes before, had galloped forth in obedience
to their orders and met their soldier fate. Out to the southeast the ridge fell gradually away
into the general level of the rolling prairie, and there, full a thousand yards distant, there
suddenly darted into view three horsemen, troopers evidently, spurring madly for home.

"They've cut their way through! Thank God!" almost screamed the spectators at the parapet.
But their exultation died an instant later. Over the ridge, in swift pursuit came a dozen painted,
feathered braves, their ponies racing at lightning speed, their arrows and bullets whizzing
along the line of flight. The horse of the foremost trooper was staggering, and suddenly went
plunging headlong, sending his rider sprawling far out on the turf. He was up in a second,
dire peril nerving him to desperate effort. His comrades veered at his cry for help and glanced
back over their shoulders. One, unnerved at sight of the dashing foemen in pursuit, clapped
spurs again, and bending low, rode madly on. The other, gallant fellow! reined about in wide,
sweeping circle, and turned back to meet his running comrade. This would draw a quick intake of the breath
from the hurt man and an "aahh"--but not once a word of blame. I should want to curse the careless
hand that wrenched my wound, but these soldiers of France and Belgium whom I carried had passed
beyond littleness.

Once we had a French Zouave officer on the stretcher.

He was wounded in the right arm and the stomach. Every careen of the
ambulance over cobble and into shell-hole was a thrust into his hurt.

We had to carry him all the way from the Nieuport cellar to Zuydcoote Hospital, ten miles. The driver
was one more of the American young men who have gone over into France to pay back a little of
what we owe her. I want to give his name, Robert Cardell Toms, because it is good for us to know
that we have brave and tender gentlemen. On this long haul, as always, he drove with extreme care, changing
his speed without the staccato jerk, avoiding bumps and holes of the
trying road.

When we reached the hospital, he ran ahead into the ward to prepare the
bed. The officer beckoned me to him.

He spoke with some difficulty, as the effort caught him in the wound of his stomach.

"Please be good enough," he said, "to give my thanks to the chauffeur.

He has driven me down with much consideration. He cares for wounded men."

Where other races are grateful and inarticulate, the French are able to put into speech the last fine touch
of feeling.

My friend kept a supply of cigarettes for his ambulance cases, and
as soon as the hour-long drive began we dealt them out to the bandaged
men.

How often we have started with a groaning man for the ride to Zuydcoote, and
how well the trip went, when we had lighted his cigarette for him. It
brought back a little of the conversation and the merriment which it
had called out in better days. It is such a relief to be wounded.
You have done your duty, and now you are to have a little rest.

With a clear conscience, you can sink back into laziness, far away from noise
and filth.

Luck has come along and pulled the pack off your back, and the responsibility from your sick mind. No weary
city clerk ever went to his seashore holiday with more blitheness than some of our wounded showed
as they came riding in from the Nieuport trenches at full length on
the stretcher, and singing all the way. What is a splintered forehead or
a damaged leg compared to the happiness of an honorable discharge? Nothing
to do for a month but lie quietly, and watch the wholesome, clean-clad
nurse. I am not forgetting the sadness of many men, nor the men hurt to death,
who lay motionless and did not sing, and some of whom died while we were
on the road to help. I am only trying to tell of the one man in every
four who was glad of his enforced rest, and who didn't let a little
thing like agony conquer his gaiety.

Those men were the
Joyous Wounded. I have seldom seen men more light hearted.

Word came to my wife
one day that several hundred wounded were side-tracked at Furnes railway station.
With two nurses she hurried to them, carrying hot soup. The women went through
the train, feeding the soldiers, giving them a drink of cold water,
and bringing some of them hot water for washing. Then, being fed, they
were ready for a smoke, and my wife began walking down the foul-smelling
ambulance car with boxes of supplies, letting each man take out a
cigarette and a match. The car was slung with double layers of stretcher
bunks. Some men were freshly wounded, others were convalescent. A
few lay in a stupor. She provided ten or a dozen soldiers with their
pleasure, and they lighted up and were well under way. She had so
many patients that day that she was not watching the individual man
in her general distribution. One by one the dark dots among the bowlders ceased to stir and move about.
Little by little the fire slackened, and all but occasional scattered shots died utterly away.
Then other forms, feathered and bedizened, were seen rushing in numbers up the distant hillside,
and that meant all was over, and the brutal knives were busily at work. Little by little all
sound of conflict, all sight of combatants, disappeared entirely, and the unclouded sunshine
streamed down upon a scene on which the silence of death indeed had fallen. When at last, late
that afternoon, the watchers reported a vast body of Indians drifting away eastward toward
the distant Powder River, and venturesome scouts stole out to reconnoiter, backed by skirmish
lines from the stricken post, they found the grassy slopes beyond that curtaining ridge one
broad field of death, strewn with the stripped and hacked and mangled forms of those who had
so gallantly dashed forth to the aid of comrade soldiery at the break of day, so torn and mutilated
and disfigured that only a limited few were ever identified. Officers and men, one after another,
had died in their tracks, victims of Red Cloud and the Ogallalla Sioux.

And all for what? Late that night the quartermaster in wild agitation sought his colonel's
door, a package in his hands. "For God's sake, sir, look at this!" he cried.

The cords had just been cut, the seals just broken, the stout paper carefully opened and the
contents of the precious packet exposed to view. It held no money at all, nothing but layer
on layer of waste and worthless paper!

CHAPTER XXI.

A week went by at Fort Emory, and not a word came back from Dean. The furious storm that swept
the hills and swelled the rivers was the talk of every army post within two hundred miles,
while in the gambling halls and saloons of Laramie, Cheyenne and Gate City men spoke of it
in low tones and with bated breath. If ever the bolts of heaven were launched to defeat a foul
crime it was right there at Cañon Springs, for the story was all over Wyoming by this time
how the worst gang of cutthroats that ever infested the wide West had galloped in strong force
to that wild, sequestered nook to murder Dean and his whole party of the hated "blue bellies,"
if need be, but at all hazards to get the precious package in his charge. Fifty thousand dollars
in government greenbacks it contained, if Hank Birdsall, their chosen leader, could be believed,
and hitherto he had never led them astray. He swore that he had the "straight tip," and that
every man who took honest part in the fight, that was sure to ensue, should have his square
one thousand dollars. Thirty to ten, surrounding the soldiers along the bluffs on every side,
they counted on easy victory. But the warning thunder had been enough for the young troop leader,
and prompted him to break camp and get out of the gorge. They were starting when Birdsall's
scouts peered over the bank and the outlaw ordered instant pursuit, just in time to meet the
fury of the flood and to see some of his fellows drowned like rats in a sewer.

But who betrayed the secret? What officer or government employé revealed the fact that Dean
was going with so much treasure?--and what could have been his object? Birdsall had taken to
the mountains and was beyond pursuit. "Shorty," one of his men, rescued from drowning by the
mail carrier and escort coming down from Frayne, confessed the plot and the General was now
at Emory investigating. Major Burleigh had taken to his bed. Captain Newhall was reported gone
to Denver. Old John Folsom lay with bandaged head and blinded eyes in a darkened room, assiduously
nursed by Pappoose and Jessie, who in turn were devotedly attended by Mrs. Fletcher. Possessed
of some strange nervous excitement, this energetic woman was tireless in her effort to be of
use. Minus ten of their very best, "C" Troop still camped at Emory, the General holding it
for possible escort duty, and, to his huge delight, young Loomis was assigned to command it
until Dean should return. There came a day when the news arrived from Frayne that the Laramie
column had crossed the Platte and marched on for the Big Horn, and then John Folsom began to
mend and was allowed to sit up, and told the doctor he had need to see Major Burleigh without
delay, but Burleigh could not leave his bed, said the physician in attendance--a very different
practitioner from Folsom's--and the old man began to fret and fume, and asked for writing materials.
He wrote Burleigh a note, and the doctor forbade his patient's reading anything. Major Burleigh,
said he, was a very sick man, and in a wretchedly nervous condition. Serious consequences were
feared unless utter quiet could be assured.

Then Folsom was pronounced well enough to be taken out for a drive, and he and Pappoose had
the back seat together, while Jessie, with Harry Loomis to drive, sat in front, and Jess was
shy and happy, for Loomis had plainly lost his heart to his comrade's pretty sister. Marshall
had now been gone nine days and could soon be expected home, said everybody, for with a big
force going up there the Indians would scatter and "the boys" would have no trouble coming
back. And so this lovely summer afternoon every one seemed bright and joyous at the fort, listening
to the band and wondering, some of the party at least, how much longer it would be before they
could hope to hear from the absent, when there arose sudden sounds of suppressed commotion
in the camp of "C" Troop. A courier was coming like mad on the road from Frayne--a courier
whose panting horse reined up a minute, with heaving flanks, in the midst of the thronging
men, and all the troop turned white and still at the news the rider briefly told:--three companies
at Warrior Gap were massacred by the Sioux, one hundred and seventy men in all, including Sergeant
Bruce and all "C" Troop's men but Conroy and Garret, who had cut their way through with Lieutenant
Dean and were safe inside the stockade, though painfully wounded. This appalling story the
girls heard with faces blanched with horror. Passionate weeping came to Jessie's relief, but
Pappoose shed never a tear. The courier's dispatches were taken in to the colonel, and Folsom,
trembling with mingled weakness and excitement, followed.

It was an impressive scene as the old soldier read the sad details to the rapidly growing group
of weeping women, for that was Emory's garrison now, while the official reports were hurried
on to catch the General on his way to Cheyenne. Some one warned the band leader, and the musicians
marched away to quarters. Some one bore the news to town where the flags over the hotel and
the one newspaper office were at once lowered to half staff, although that at Emory, true to
official etiquette and tradition, remained until further orders at the peak, despite the fact
that two of the annihilated companies were from that very post. Some one bore the news to Burleigh's
quarters at the depot, and, despite assertions that the major could see no one and must not
be agitated or disturbed, disturbed and agitated he was beyond per-adventure. Excitedly the
sick man sprang from his bed at the tidings of the massacre and began penning a letter. Then
he summoned a young clerk from his office and told him he had determined to get up at once,
as now every energy of the government would doubtless be put forth to bring the Sioux to terms.
It was the young clerk who a few weeks back had remarked to a fellow employé how "rattled"
the old man was getting. The major's doctor was not about. The major began dictating letters
to various officials as he rapidly dressed, and what happened can best be told in the clerk's
own words: "For a man too sick to see any one two hours before," said he, "the major had wonderful
recuperative powers, but they didn't last. He was in the midst of a letter to the chief quartermaster
and had got as far as to say, 'The deplorable and tragic fate of Lieutenant Dean points, of
course, to the loss of the large sum intrusted to him,' when I looked up and said, 'Why, Lieutenant
Dean ain't dead, major; he got in all right,' and he stared at me a minute as if I had stabbed
him. His face turned yellow-white and down he went like a log--had a fit I s'pose. Then I ran
for help, and then the doctor came and hustled everybody out."

But not till late that night did these details reach "Old Pecksniff" at the post. A solemn
time was that veteran having, for many of the women were almost in hysterics and all were in
deep distress. Two of their number, wives of officers, were widowed by the catastrophe, and
one lay senseless for hours. It was almost dark when Mr. Folsom and the girls drove homeward,
and his face was lined and haggard. Pappoose nestled fondly, silently at his side, holding
his hand and closely scanning his features, as though striving to read his thoughts. Jessie,
comforted now by the knowledge that Marshall was rapidly recovering, and the words of praise
bestowed upon him in the colonel's letters, was nevertheless in deep anxiety as to the future.
The assurance that the Sioux, even in their overwhelming numbers, would not attack a stockade,
was not sufficient. Marshall would be on duty again within a very few days, the colonel said.
His wounds would heal within the week, and it was only loss of so much blood that had prostrated
him. Within a few days, then, her loved brother would be in saddle and in the field against
the Indians. Who could assure her they would not have another pitched battle? Who could say
that the fate that befell the garrison at Warrior Gap might not await the troop when next it
rode away? And poor Jess had other anxieties, too, by this time. Loomis was burning with eagerness
for orders to lead it instantly to join the field column, and importuned Colonel Stevens, even
in the midst of all the grief and shock of the early evening. Almost angrily the veteran colonel
bade him attend to his assigned duties and not demand others. "C" Troop should not with his
advice and consent be sent north of the Platte. "First thing you know, sir, after they've got
all the troops up along the Big Horn you'll see the Sioux in force this side of the river,
murdering right and left, and not a company to oppose them. No, sir, more than enough of that
troop have already been sacrificed! The rest shall stay here."

And well was it, for one and all, that "Old Pecksniff" held firm to his decision. It was one
of his lucid intervals.

Late that evening, after ten o'clock, there came the sound of hoof-beats on the hard road and
the crack of the long-lashed mule-whip, and the fort ambulance clattered up to Folsom's gate,
and the colonel himself, his adjutant by his side, came nervously up the gravel walk. Folsom
met them at his door. Instinctively he felt that something new and startling was added to the
catalogue of the day's disastrous tidings. Pecksniff's face was eloquent of gravest concern,
mingled with irrepressible excitement.

"Let me see you in private, quick," he said. "Mr.--Ah--Mr. Adjutant, will you kindly remain
in the parlor," and, taking Folsom by the elbow, Pecksniff led impetuously into the library.
The girls had gone aloft only a moment before, but, dreading news of further evil, Pappoose
came fluttering down.

"Go in and welcome the adjutant, dear," said Folsom hurriedly. "The colonel and I have some
matters to talk of." Obediently she turned at once, and, glancing up the stairs, noted that
Mrs. Fletcher's door must have been suddenly opened, for the light from her room was now streaming
on the third-floor balusters. Listening again! What could be the secret of that woman's intense
watchfulness? In the parlor the young staff officer was pacing up and down, but his face lighted
at sight of Elinor.

"Do you know--Is there anything new?--anything worse?" she quickly asked, as she gave her slim
young hand.

"Not concerning our people," was the significant answer. "But I fear there's more excitement
coming."

Barely waiting for Elinor to withdraw, "Pecksniff" had turned on Folsom. "You know I opposed
the sending of that party? You know it was all ordered on Burleigh's urging and representations,
do you not?"

"Yes, I heard so," said Folsom. "What then?"

"You know he planned the whole business--sent 'em around by Cañon Springs and the Sweetwater?"

"Yes, I heard that, too," said Folsom, still wondering.

"You know some one must have put that Birdsall gang on the scent, and that Burleigh has had
alleged nerve prostration ever since, and has been too ill to see any one or to leave his bed."

"Yes, so we were told."

"Well, he's well enough to be up and away--God knows where, and here is the reason--just in
from the north," and, trembling with excitement, Pecksniff pointed to the closing paragraph
of the letter in his hand:

     "Cords, seals and wrapping were intact when handed to the
     quartermaster, but the contents were nothing but worthless paper.
     It must have been so when given to Lieutenant Dean."

Folsom's eyes were popping from his head. He sank into a chair, gazing up in consternation.

"Don't you see, man!" said Pecksniff, "some one in the depot is short ten thousand dollars
or so. Some one hoped to cover this shortage in just this way--to send a little squad with
a bogus package, and then turn loose the biggest gang of ruffians in the country. They would
have got it but for the storm at Cañon Springs, and no one would have been the wiser. They
couldn't have got it without a murderous fight. No one would ever dare confess his complicity
in it. No statement of theirs that there wasn't a cent in the sack could ever be believed.
Some one's shortage would be covered and his reputation saved. The plot failed, and God's mercy
was over Dean's young head. He'd 'a been murdered or ruined if the plan worked--and now Burleigh's
gone!"

CHAPTER XXII.

Yes, Burleigh was gone, and there was confusion at the depot. At six the doctor had come forth
from his room, saying he was better, but must not be disturbed. At seven the major, carrying
a satchel, had appeared at his office, where two clerks were smoking their pipes, innocent
of all thought of their employer's coming. It was after hours. They had no business there at
the time. Smoking was prohibited in the office, yet it was the major who seemed most embarrassed
at the unexpected meeting. It was the major who hastily withdrew. He was traced to the railway,
and it was speedily found that he had sent word to the division superintendent that the General
had telegraphed for him to join him at once at Cheyenne, and a special engine and caboose would
be needed. At a quarter past seven this had started full speed. It was eleven when the discovery
was made. Meantime Folsom and Stevens had consulted together. Folsom had told of the large
sum he had loaned Burleigh and the conditions attached, and between them a dispatch, concisely
setting forth their suspicions, was sent the General at Cheyenne, with orders to "rush," as
they were determined if possible to head off the fugitive at that point. Back came the wire
ten minutes before midnight that the General had left Cheyenne for Laramie by stage that evening,
and must now be near the Chugwater and far from telegraphic communication. Then Stevens wired
the sheriff at Cheyenne and the commanding officer of the new post of Fort Russell to stop
Burleigh at all hazards, and at two in the morning the answer came that the major had reached
Cheyenne about midnight and they would search everywhere for him. That was the last until long
after the rising of another sun.

Events and excitements, alarms and rumors followed each other with startling rapidity during
the day. In glaring headlines the local paper published the details of the massacre at the
Gap, lauding the valor and devotion of the soldiers, but heaping abuse upon the commander of
the post, who, with other troops at his disposal, had looked on and lifted no hand to aid them.
Later, of course, it was proved that the veteran had foiled old Red Cloud's villainous plan
to lure the whole garrison into the open country and there surround and slowly annihilate it,
while then, or at their leisure later, his chosen ones should set fire to the unprotected stockade
and bear off those of the women or children whose years did not commend them to the mercy of
the hatchet. Soldiers and thinking men soon saw the colonel was right and that the only mistake
he had made was in allowing any of the garrison to go forth at all. The districts or townships which have
voted additional local taxes are usually those in which there are comparatively few negroes. The
average salary paid to negro teachers, although low, is as large
as can be earned in most of the occupations open to them, and any
sudden or large increase would neither immediately raise the standard
of competency nor insure a much larger proportion of the ability of
the race.

The percentage of school attendance of negro children is lower than in the case of white children. Very few
negro children, whether because of economic pressure, lack of ability, or lack of desire for
knowledge, complete even the fifth grade. Among negroes there is little real demand for high school
instruction, which is more expensive than elementary instruction. Therefore, the proportion of the total
funds spent for negro education might properly be less than their numbers would indicate. If
the proportionate amount spent today for the instruction of certain racial
groups of the foreign population could be separated from the total, it would
be found that less than the average is spent upon them for the same
reasons.

However, when all allowances have been made, it is obvious that the
negro is receiving less than a fair share of the appropriations made
by the Southern States for education.

The inadequate public schools for negroes have been excused or justified
upon the ground that private and church schools are supplying the
need. He,
together with two other men, had spent the late hours of the night at the lodgings of one of
the party in Cheyenne, and at dawn had driven away in a "rig" hired at a local stable, ostensibly
to follow the General to Laramie. They had kept the road northwestward on leaving town--were
seen passing along the prairie beyond Fort Russell, but deputies, sworn in at once and sent
in pursuit, came back to say the rig had never gone as far as Lodge Pole. At six P. M. came
further tidings. Lieutenant Loring, engineer officer of the department, had reached Cheyenne
and was in consultation with the commanding officer at Russell. The rig had been found at Sloan's
ranch, far up Crow Creek, where the party had taken horses and ridden westward into the Black
Hills. In anticipation of a big reward, the sheriff had deputies out in pursuit. From such
information as they could gather it was learned that the name of one of the parties gone with
Burleigh was Newhall, who claimed to be a captain in the army, "out there looking after investments"--a
captain who was too busy, however, to go and see the few fellows of his cloth at the new post
and who was not known to them by sight at all. The engineer, Mr. Loring, was making minute
inquiries about this fellow, for the description given him had excited not a little of his
interest.

And so the sun of the second day went down on Gate City and Emory, and everybody knew Burleigh
was gone. The wildest rumors were afloat, and while all Fort Emory was in mourning over the
tragedy at Warrior Gap, everybody in town seemed more vividly concerned in Burleigh and the
cause of his sudden flight. As yet only certain army officers and Mr. Folsom knew of the startling
discovery at the stockade--that the package was a bogus affair throughout. But all Gate City
knew Burleigh had drawn large sums from the local bank, many citizens had heard that John Folsom
was several thousand dollars the poorer for his sudden going, and all interest was centered
in the coming from Chicago of an expert, summoned by wire, to open the huge office safe at
the quartermaster's depot The keys had gone with Burleigh. At the last moment, after loading
up with all the cash his own private safe contained, for that was found open and practically
empty in its corner of his sitting-room, and when he had evidently gone to the office to get
the funds there stored, he was confounded by the sight of the two employés. He could have ordered
them to leave and then helped himself, but conscience had made a coward of him, even more than
nature. He saw accusers in every face, and fled. Burleigh had lost his nerve.

Two days went by and excitement was at its height. All manner of evil report of Burleigh was
now afloat. The story of the bogus package had been noised abroad through later messengers
and dispatches from the Gap. Lieutenant Loring had come to Fort Emory under the instructions
of the department commander, and what those instructions were no man could find out from the
reticent young officer. If ever a youth seemed capable of hearing everything and telling nothing
it was this scientist of a distinguished corps that frontiersmen knew too little of. What puzzled
Folsom and old Pecksniff was the persistence with which he followed up his inquiries about
Captain Newhall. He even sought an interview with Pappoose and asked her to describe the rakish
traveler who had so unfavorably impressed her. She was looking her loveliest that evening.
Jessie was radiant once more. A long letter had come from Marshall--sad because of the fate
that had befallen his companions, stern because of the evidence of the deep-laid plot that
so nearly made him a victim, but modestly glad of the official commendation he had received,
and rejoicing over the surgeon's promise that he would be well enough to make the march with
a command ordered back to Frayne. Red Cloud's people had scattered far and wide, said he. "God
grant they may not turn back to the south." He was coming home. He would soon be there. The
papers had told their readers this very morning that the General had plainly said his force
was too small to risk further assault upon the Sioux. Alarmed at the result of its policy,
the Bureau had recommended immediate abandonment of Warrior Gap and the withdrawal of the troops
from the Big Horn country. The War Department, therefore, had to hold its hand. The Indians
had had by long, long odds the best of the fight, and perhaps would be content to let well
enough alone. All this had tended to bring hope to the hearts of most of the girls, and Loring's
welcome was the more cordial because of this and because of his now known championship of Marshall's
cause. From being a fellow under the ban of suspicion and the cloud of official censure, Marshall
Dean was blossoming out as a hero. It was late in the evening when Folsom brought the young
engineer from the hotel and found Elinor and Jessie in the music-room, with Pecksniff's adjutant
and Loomis in devoted attendance. It was nearly eleven when the officers left--two returning
to the fort, Loring lingering for a word with Folsom at the gate. The night was still and breathless.
The stars gleamed brilliantly aloft, but the moon was young and had early gone to bed. A window
in the third story softly opened, as the two men stopped for their brief conference--the one
so young-looking, sturdy and alert, despite the frost of so many winters; the other so calm
and judicial, despite his youth.

"Up to this afternoon at five no trace of them has been found," said Loring. "Day after to-morrow
that safe-opener should reach us. If you have influence with Colonel Stevens you should urge
him to have a guard at the quartermaster's depot, even if he has to strip the fort. The General
cannot be reached by wire."

"Why?" asked Folsom, looking up in alarm. "You don't suppose he'd come back to rob his own office?"

"He is not the man to take a risk, but there are those with him not so careful, and the hand
that sent Birdsall's gang in chase of Dean could send them here, with the safe-key. Those few
clerks and employés would be no match for them."

"By heaven, I believe you're right!" cried Folsom. "Which way are you going now?"

"Back to the hotel by way of the depot," was the answer. "Will you go?"

"One moment. I do not travel about just now without a gun," said Folsom, stepping within doors,
and even the low sound of their voices died away and all was still as a desert. The old trader
did not return at once. Something detained him--Miss Folsom, probably, reasoned the engineer,
as he stood there leaning on the gate. Aloft a blind creaked audibly, and, gazing upward, Loring
saw a dark, shadowy shutter at the third-story window swing slowly in. There was no wind to
move it. Why should human hands be so stealthy? Then a dim light shone through the slats, and
the shade was raised, and, while calmly watching the performance, Loring became aware of a
dim, faint, far-away click of horse's hoofs at the gallop, coming from the north.

"If that were from the eastward, now," thought he, "it might bring stirring news." But the
sound died away after a moment, as though the rider had dived into sandy soil.

Just then Folsom reappeared, "I had to explain to my daughter. She is most reluctant to have
me go out at night just now."

"Naturally," said Loring calmly. "And have you been way up to the third story? I suppose Miss
Folsom has gone to her room."

"The girls have, both of them--but not to the third story. That's Mrs. Fletcher's room."

"Ah, yes. The woman, I believe, who accidentally scared your horse and threw you?"

"The very one!" he answered. "I'm blessed if I know what should have taken her out at that
hour. The paper Whitelocke laid up, and transcribed in a larger treatise.

[SN: Effect of the Prince's visit.]

Woolfeldt acquainted Whitelocke that the
public ministers in this Court discoursed much of the extraordinary respect
showed by the Prince to the English Ambassador, both in his reception
and the Prince's visit to him. And particularly the Danish Ambassador
was greatly discontented, and said that never any ambassador had
that honour done him before, and it was so far beyond what he had received
that he knew not how to bear it; that the entertainment of public
ministers of the same character ought to be with the same ceremony, and
not one to be preferred so much as the English Ambassador had been before
others of equal quality with him, and much matter of complaint of that
nature; which being reported to the Prince, he said that neither
the Danish Ambassador nor any other public minister had cause to complain
that he had not given them the respect due to their several qualities;
and if he, out of a particular affection to the English Protector
and Ambassador, had a mind to express more than ordinary particular
respects to them, it was no wrong or cause of complaint to any other
public minister, who had what was due to him, because another had
perhaps more than was due to him; and he said he understood not why
his condition should render him less capable than other gentlemen
to show particular respects where they did bear a particular affection.

General

Douglas, a Scottish gentleman in great favour and honour in this country, came late this year to the Court,
being hindered by a violent ague upon his coming hither. He made frequent
visits to Whitelocke, and expressed much of respect and civility to
him as his countryman.

[SN: Whitelocke dines with General Douglas.]

This day Whitelocke was to dine with Douglas by a solemn invitation; and during
the whole time of his residence in this Court he never was invited to any
of their tables, but now to Douglas, and before to Grave Eric, notwithstanding
the freedom of his table to most of them. With Whitelocke were invited
his two sons, Potley, Beake, and Croke. There they met Grave John
Oxenstiern, Wrangel, Wittenberg, Bundt, Horne, Vanderlin, Colonel
Bannier, and one of the Prince's servants. "Come on, quick!" murmured the engineer, and on tiptoe,
wondering, the two men followed. They saw her halt at the barred gate. Low, yet distinct she
spoke a single name: "George!" And without, in the alley, a voice answered: "I'm here! open,
quick!"

"Swear that you are alone!"

"Oh, stop that damned nonsense! Of course I'm alone!" was the sullen reply, and at the sound
of the voice Loring seemed fairly to quiver. The gate was unbarred. A man's form, slender and
shadowy, squeezed in and seemed peering cautiously about. "You got my note?" he began. "You
know what's happened?"

But a woman's muffled scream was the answer. With a spring like a cat Loring threw himself
on the intruder and bore him down. In an instant Folsom had barred the gate, and the woman,
moaning, fell upon her knees.

"Mercy! Mercy!" she cried. "It is all my fault. I sent for him."

"Take your hands off, damn you, or you'll pay for this!" cried the undermost man. "I'm Captain
Newhall, of the army!"

"You're a thief!" answered Loring, through his set teeth. "Hand over the key of that safe!"

The sound of hoof-beats at the front had suddenly ceased. There was a sputter and scurry in
the alley behind. Full half a dozen horses must have gone tearing away to the east. Other lights
were popping in the windows now. Folsom's household was alarmed. Attracted by the scream and
the sound of scuffle, a man came hurrying toward them from the front.

"Halt! Who are you?" challenged Folsom, covering him with his revolver.

"Don't shoot. I'm Ned Lannion--just in from the ranch. Have you heard anything of Hal, sir?"

"Of Hal?" gasped Folsom, dropping his pistol in dismay. "In God's name, what's wrong?"

"God only knows, sir. Mrs. Hal's nigh crazy. He's been gone two days."

CHAPTER XXIII.

Five days later the women and children from Warrior Gap, most of them bereaved, all of them
unnerved by the experiences of that awful day, arrived at old Fort Frayne, escorted by a strong
command of infantry and all that was left of the cavalry troop at the stockade. A sad procession
it was as it slowly forded the Platte and ascended the winding road to the post, where sorrowing,
sympathetic army women met and ministered to them. With them, too, came such of the wounded
as could be moved, and at the head of the little squad of horse rode Lieutenant Dean, whom
the post commander and several officers greeted almost effusively.

Yet almost the first question was, "Did you see any Indians?"

"Not one," answered Dean. "They seem to have drawn away from the Big Horn road entirely. Why
do you ask?" he added anxiously.

"There were signal fires out at Eagle Butte last night, and I've just had a letter from old
Folsom at the ranch on the Laramie. He begs us to send a guard at once, and I haven't a horseman.
There's been the devil to pay at young Folsom's place."

Dean's face went a shade paler. "What's happened?" he asked.

"A dozen of his best horses run off by Birdsall's gang, probably to replace those they lost
in the flood, and Hal himself was shot and left for dead in the hills. He'd have died but for
an Ogallalla girl and a couple of half-breeds who had a hunting lodge out near the Peak. There
are letters for you at the office."

There were two--one from Loomis, at Emory; one from Jessie, of all places in the world, at
Folsom's ranch. This he read first.

     "We got here late night before last, after such an exciting
     journey, Marshall dear," said she, "and I can't begin to tell you
     all the strange things that have happened, for Mr. Folsom says the
     messenger must start for Fort Frayne in twenty minutes. That
     villain, Major Burleigh, who dared to speak ill of you, turned out
     to be as bad as I ever said he was. They haven't caught him yet,
     but they've got Captain Newhall. Mr. Folsom and Mr. Loring did
     that--caught him in the backyard of our house, down by the gate,
     and in some way Mrs. Fletcher induced him to come there, for he had
     the key of the safe at the quartermaster's depot, and was going to
     get the money Major Burleigh dared not take when he fled. I can't
     understand it at all, and Pappoose doesn't like to talk about it.
     But Mr. Folsom was robbed of lots of money by Major Burleigh. Mrs.
     Fletcher is mixed up in it in such a queer way, I can't explain
     how. She was nearly crazy when we came away, and Mr. Folsom was so
     good and kind to her, left a nurse with her, and made her stay at
     the house, although she wanted to pack her things and go to the
     hotel or the jail, she didn't care which; but he wouldn't let her.

     "And right in the midst of it all Ned Lannion, who came with news
     before, galloped in to tell how Halbert Folsom had been missing two
     days and Mrs. Folsom was crazy with fear, so Mr. Folsom left
     Lieutenant Loring to attend to all the matters about the robbery
     and started at once for the ranch, and Pappoose, of course,
     insisted on going with him, and I would not be left behind. And
     here we are. Now I can see the hills where you had the fight and
     wore Elinor's picture, and it was right out there among them that
     Halbert was found. Horse thieves had run off his best horses--the
     same gang of murderers that, they say, planned to trap you and that
     you outwitted. Oh! Marshall, was ever a girl so proud of her
     brother!--and they shot Hal and he was found and taken care of by
     some Indian people, tame ones, and one was a girl, Lizette, who had
     fallen in love with him four years ago. Wasn't it romantic? And
     she's gone again, but Hal is safe here, although Mrs. Folsom is
     more than half-crazy, and now old Mr. Folsom is worried to death,
     and says we must start back for home to-morrow. It's seventy-five
     miles and we don't want to go at all--only I'm so eager to see you,
     and I heard--at least Mr. Loomis told me you'd be back any day, and
     he has your troop till you come, and he's so fond of you--Oh,
     here's Pappoose to say this must go at once."

The colonel sat watching the young fellow as he read. "Bad news, Dean?" he queried.

"Every kind of news, sir. It's all a whirl. The devil seems to have broken loose in Wyoming.
Let me skim through Loomis' note.

     "DEAR DEAN: In case the letter sent yesterday passes you
     on the way, I add a line to say that if ever I said a mean thing
     about Loring when we were in the corps, I take it back. I thought
     him a prig when we wore the gray. He rather 'held us under' anyhow,
     being a class ahead, you know, but the way he has panned out here
     and wiped up Wyoming with the only men I ever knew that tried to
     wrong you is simply wonderful. He's nabbed three of the Birdsall
     gang and is away now after Burleigh. The news from Folsom's ranch
     is more reassuring. Hal was shot by horsethieves who were running
     off stock, and was found and taken care of by friendly Indians, but
     Mrs. Hal had an awful scare and sent for the old man, who went, of
     course--both young ladies going with him. They were miles away
     before we knew it at the fort. I tried to pursuade old Pecksniff
     that he ought to let me go with twenty troopers to guard the ranch
     and scout the Laramie, and he threatened to put me in arrest. Of
     all the double-dashed, pig-headed old idiots he's the worst. I
     don't want people at the ranch to be scared, but if the Sioux only
     would make some demonstration this way that would give me a chance.
     I'd try to earn a little of the reputation that you're winning, old
     boy, and no man knows better how much you deserve it than

     "Your friend and classmate, HANK L."

     "P. S.--Loring took ten of the troop into the Black Hills to beat
     up Burleigh, but he said if they struck Indian sign he meant to
     make for Folsom's ranch. Now, if we could only meet there!"

The sun was well down at the west. The day's march had been long and tedious, as only cavalry
marches are when long wagon trains have to be escorted. Dean had not yet fully recovered strength,
but anxiety lent him energy.

"If Mr. Folsom says there is need of cavalry guard at the Laramie, it is because he dreads
an other Indian visit, colonel. I have nine men in good shape. Our horses are fresh, or will
be after a few hours' rest. May I push on to-night?"

And to the young soldier's surprise the elder placed a trembling hand upon his shoulder and
looked him earnestly in the eyes. "Dean, my boy, it's my belief you cannot start too soon.
Do you know who Lizette is?"

"I've heard the story," said Marshall briefly. "She must have been hovering about there for
some time."

"Yes, and now her people know it, and it will rekindle their hatred. The moment I heard of
this I sent old Bat to watch the crossing at La Bonté. Not an hour ago this came in by the
hand of his boy," and the colonel held out a scrap of paper. It a rude pictograph, a rough
sketch, map-like, of a winding river--another and smaller one separated from the first by a
chain of mountains. The larger one was decorated by a flag-pole with stars and stripes at the
top and a figure with musket and bayonet at the bottom. The smaller one by a little house,
with smoke issuing from the chimney, and a woman beside it. Above all, its head over the mountains
pointing toward the house, its tail extending north of the bigger stream, was a comet--the
"totem" or sign of the Ogallalla lover of Lizette. The story was told at a glance. Burning
Star was already south of the Platte and lurking in the mountains near Folsom's ranch.

That night, toward ten o'clock, an anxious council was held. Halbert Folsom, fevered by his
severe wound, was lying half-unconscious on his bed, his unhappy wife wandering aimlessly about
at times, wringing her hands and weeping, evidently unbalanced by the terrors that had beset
her of late and the tidings of that awful Indian revenge along the Big Horn. Silent, helpful,
almost commanding, Elinor spent the hours sometimes at her brother's bedside, then at that
of her sister-in-law when the poor creature could be induced to lie still a moment. The burly
little son and heir, long since sound asleep in his cradle, was watched over by Jessie, whose
heart fluttered in dread she dare not say of what. Twice that afternoon she had seen whispered
conferences between old Folsom and Lannion. She knew that for some better reason than that
he was overpersuaded by Pappoose, Mr. Folsom had not carried out his project of sending them
back to Gate City. She saw that he made frequent visits to the cellar and had changed the arrangement
of the air ports. She noted that the few ranch hands hung about the premises all day, their
rifles ever within reach, and that often Mr. Folsom took the glasses and searched the road
to Frayne. She saw that earth was being heaped up in places against the ranch where the walls
were thin or made of boarding. She saw that water and provisions were being stored in the cellar,
and she knew that it could all mean only one thing--that the Indians were again in force in
the neighborhood, and that an Indian siege was imminent.

And all this time Pappoose, though very brave, was so still and so intent upon her duties.
Even when supper was served for the ranch people in the kitchen that evening, as the sun went
down, Jess noted that two of the men kept constantly in saddle, riding round the buildings
and anxiously scanning the open prairie on every side. There were only six men, all told now,
including Folsom (of course not counting Hal, who was defenseless), altogether too small a
number to successfully protect so large a knot of buildings against an insidious and powerful
foe, and even of these six there were two who seemed so unstrung by tidings of the massacre
as to be nearly nerveless.

Darkness settled down upon the valley, and, though calm and collected, Folsom seemed oppressed
by the deepest anxiety. Every now and then he would step forth into the night and make a circuit
of the buildings, exchange a word in low tone with some invisible guardian, for, heavily armed,
the employés were gathered at the main building, and the wife and children of the chief herdsman
were assigned to a room under its roof. Particularly did Folsom pet and encourage the dogs,
two of them splendid mastiffs in whom Hal took unusual pride. Then he would return to his son's
bedside, bend anxiously over him and lay a loving hand on Pappoose's lustrous hair. It must
have been ten o'clock and a night wind was rising, making the occasional cry of the coyotes
even more weird and querulous, when they heard the sudden, fierce challenge of Trooper, the
keenest, finest of the mastiffs, and instantly his bark was echoed by the rush and scurry of
every canine on the place. The men on the porch sprang to their feet and Folsom hastened out
to join them. The dogs had charged in the darkness toward the northeast, and somewhere out
in that direction were now all furiously barking. Aloft the skies were heavily clouded. The
moon was banked and not a glimmer of light shone on earth or heaven. Suddenly, afar out over
the prairie, beyond where the dogs were challenging, there was heard the sound of a pony's
neigh, an eager appeal for welcome and shelter, and Folsom sprang confidently forward, his
powerful tones calling off the dogs. They came back, growling, sniffing, only half-satisfied,
still bristling at the unseen visitor. "War ponies never neigh," said Folsom. "Who are you,
brothers--friends?" he called, in the Sioux tongue, and a faint voice answered from the darkness,
a pony came loping dimly into view, almost running over him, and in another minute an Indian
girl, trembling with fear and exhaustion, had toppled from the saddle and clasped the old trader's
hand.

"Good God! Lizette," he cried, "you again? What is wrong?" for her head was drooping, her knees
giving way beneath her, as the poor child whispered her answer:

"Sioux coming--plenty braves! Hide--quick!"

And Folsom bore her in his arms within.

CHAPTER XXIV.

Never unless sure of its ground and the weakness of the adversary does the modern Indian band
attack at night. Folsom and his people well knew that. Yet not five minutes after the Indian
girl, faint with exhaustion and dread, was carried within doors, the big mastiff challenged
again. The dogs charged furiously out to the northeast and would not be recalled. For nearly
half an hour they kept up their angry clamor. Time and again during the night, suspicious and
excited, they dashed out again and again, and once one of them, venturing further than his
fellows, broke suddenly into loud cries of mingled pain and rage, and when at last he came
whining piteously back to the ranch it was found that he was bleeding from a gash along the
flank, where an Indian arrow had seared him. Only by fits and starts did any man sleep. Hour
after hour Folsom's little garrison was on the alert. The women had all been moved to the deep,
dry cellar, Mrs. Hal moaning over her baby, utterly unnerved, Jessie silent, but white and
tremulous; the herdsman's wife, an Amazon, demanded the right to have a gun and fight by her
husband's side; Lizette, the Indian girl, faint and starved, asked nothing but to be allowed
to crouch at the door of the room where Halbert lay, fevered and unconscious, and Pappoose,
scorning danger, flitted from her brother's bedside to her father's log-barricade at the east
porch. In dread anxiety the hours dragged by, and at last Lannion reached forth his hand and
pulled the shirt sleeve of his comrade Jake, half-dozing at his side. In an instant the latter
was kneeling at his post. "What is it?" he queried, and Lannion, pointing to the first faint,
pallid gleam in the eastern sky, whispered: "Time to be up, man. It's coming."

For half an hour, except for the rushing of the Laramie, a silence almost unearthly had brooded
over the prairie, and even the dogs seemed lulled to sleep. But now, as the cold light crept
slowly over the distant range, and a soft flush began to overspread the pallor of the dawn,
far out over the valley the yelp of a coyote began again and all men strained their ears and
listened, while strong hands grabbed the growling dogs and pinned them to earth, for, beginning
at the east, the cry was taken up on every side. Folsom's ranch seemed beleaguered by the gaunt,
half-famished wolves of the upland prairies. "Look to your sights, now, men! Down into the
cellar, Pappoose!" exclaimed Folsom, kindling with fierce excitement. "I've been the friend
of all that tribe for thirty years, but when they break faith with me and mine that ends it!
Look to your sights and make every shot count!" he cautioned, as he made the rounds of the
little shelters thrown up during the past two days. "We can stand off a hundred of 'em if you
only keep your grit."

Again the clamor as of coyotes ceased. It was only the Indian signal "Ready," and every ranchman
knew that with the rising sun, if not before, the swoop would come. Again as the light broadened
the dogs were loosed and presently were challenging all four points of the compass. The unseen
foe was on every hand.

Perched as it was on a little rise, the ranch stood forth conspicuous over the valley. At the
foot of the slope to the south lay the corral and some of the buildings, about one hundred
yards away, where the shallow Laramie curled and lapped beneath their walls, and now the dogs
seemed to concentrate their attention on that side. Folsom, rifle in hand, was kneeling on
the porch, listening intently. Two of the hands were with him. Jake and Lannion, experienced
and reliable, had been given independent posts on the other front, and just as objects could
be dimly recognized along the flats, there burst upon the ears of the little garrison a sudden
chorus of exultant yells. A tongue of flame leaped upward from beyond the huts lately occupied
by the ranchmen. The half-used haystacks caught and held one moment the fiery messenger, and
then in a broad glare that reddened the flood of the Laramie for miles and lighted up the ranch
like a sunburst, gave forth a huge column of blaze and smoke that could be seen far over the
Black Hills of Wyoming, and all the valley seemed to spring to instant life. On every side
arose the stirring war-cry of the Sioux, the swift beat of pony hoofs, the ring of rifle, and
brave John Folsom's heart sank within him as he realized that here was no mere marauding party,
but a powerful band organized for deliberate vengeance. The Laramie plains were alive with
darting, yelling, painted horsemen, circling about the ranch, hemming it in, cutting it off
from the world.

The bullets came whistling through the morning air, biting fiercely into the solid logs, spattering
the chinking, smashing pane after pane. Some of the dogs came howling and whining back for
shelter, though the mastiffs held their ground, fiercely barking and bounding about, despite
the whistles and calls from the besieged who sought to save them to the last, but not once
as yet had the ranch replied with a shot. Down in the cellar women clung together or clasped
their wailing children and listened fearfully to the clamor. In Hal's room the fevered sufferer
awoke from his stupor and, demanding his rifle, struggled to rise from the bed, and there John
Folsom found Pappoose, pale and determined, bending over her weakened brother and holding him
down almost as she could have overpowered a child. I know I was scared every time I'd hear the slave say, 'Pray,
Master.'

"Once, when I was milking a cow, I asked Master Ousley, 'Master Ousley, will
you do me a favor?'

"He said in his drawl, 'Of course I will.'

"'Take
me to McCracken County,' I said.

I didn't even know where McCracken County was, but my sister was
there.

I wanted to find my sister. When I reached the house where my sister stayed, I went through the gate.
I asked if this was the house where Mary Meriwether lived. Her mistress
said, 'Yes, she's in the back. Are you the girl Mr. Meriwether's looking
for?" My heart was in my mouth. It just seemed I couldn't go through
the gate. I never even saw my sister that time. I hid for a while and
then went back.

"We didn't have any churches. "It's all up! There's a
million Indians!" they cried. Two of the demoralized fellows plunged into the passage that
led to the cellar. One burst into childish wailing and clung to Folsom's knees.

"Let go, you coward!" yelled the old man in fury, as he kicked himself loose, then went bounding
out upon the porch. God, what a sight! Sweeping up the gentle slope, brandishing rifles and
lances and war-clubs, racing for their hapless prey, came fifty Ogallallas, Burning Star among
the leaders. Bullets could not stop them now. The two men who had stood to their posts knelt
grim and desperate, and Lannion's last shot took effect. Within fifty yards of the walls Burning
Star's rushing pony went down on his nose, and in the fury of his pace, turned sudden and complete
somersault, crushing his red rider under him, and stretching him senseless on the turf. An
inspiration, almost God given, seemed to flash upon the old trader at the instant. Bareheaded,
in his shirt sleeves, throwing upward and forward his empty hands, he sprang out as though
to meet and rebuke his assailants. "Hold!" he cried, in the tongue he knew so well "Are my
brothers crazed? Look! I am no enemy It is your friend! It is old John!" And even in the rage
of their charge, many Indians at sight of him veered to right and left; many reined up short
within ten paces of the unarmed man; two sprang from their ponies and threw themselves between
him and their brethren, shouting to be heard. And then in the midst of furious discussion,
some Indians crying out for the blood of all at the ranch in revenge for Chaska, some demanding
instant surrender of every woman there in expiation for Lizette, some urging that old John
be given respectful hearing, but held prisoner, there came lashing into their midst a young
brave, crying aloud and pointing down the now well-lighted valley where, darting about a mile
away, a few Indians were evidently striving to head off the coming of some hostile force. Leaving
two or three of their number trying to restore consciousness to the stricken chief, and a dozen,
Folsom's advocates among them, to hold possession of the ranch, away scurried most of the warriors
at top speed to the aid of their outlying scouts.

Meantime, under cover of the fierce argument, Jake and Lannion had managed to crawl back within
the building. Folsom himself, in such calm as he could command, stood silent while his captors
wrangled. The warriors who pleaded for him were Standing Elk, a sub chief of note, whose long
attachment to Folsom was based on kindnesses shown him when a young man, the other was Young-Shows-the-Road,
son of a chief who had guided more than one party of whites through the lands of the Sioux
before the bitterness of war arose between the races. They had loved Folsom for years and would
not desert him now in the face of popular clamor. Yet even their influence would have failed
but for the sound that told of hotter conflict still among the foothills along the opposite
side of the valley. With straining ears, Folsom listened, hope and fear alternating in his
breast. The mingling yells and volleying told that the issue was in doubt. Man after man of
his captors galloped away until not half a dozen were left. Now, Jake and Lannion could have
shot them down and borne him within, but to what good? Escape from the ranch itself was impossible!
Such action would only intensify the Indian hate and make more horrible the Indian vengeance.
For twenty minutes the clamor continued, then seemed to die gradually away, and, with fury
in their faces, back at full gallop came a dozen of the braves. One glance was enough. They
had penned their foe among the rocks, but not without the loss of several at least of their
band, for the foremost rode with brandished war-club straight at Folsom, and despite the leap
of his two champions to save, felled the old trader with one stunning blow, then gave the savage
order to burn the ranch.

By this time the sun was just peering into the valley. The smoke and flame from the corral
were dying or drifting away. Eagerly half a dozen young braves rushed for faggots and kindling
with which to do his bidding, and a cry of despair went up from within the walls. Recklessly
now Lannion and his comrade opened fire from the loopholes and shot down two of the dancing
furies without, sending every other Indian to the nearest cover. But the arrows that came whistling
speedily were firebrands. The besiegers gained in force with every moment. Poor old Folsom,
slowly regaining senses as he lay bound and helpless down by the stream, whither his captors
had borne him, heard the jeers and shouts of triumph with which the Indians within the corral
were rapidly making their fire darts, when suddenly there rose on the morning air a sound that
stilled all others, a sound to which the Indians listened in superstitious awe, a sound that
stopped the hands that sought to burn out the besieged and paralyzed just long enough all inspiration
of attack. Some of the Indians, indeed, dropped their arms, others sprang to the ponies as
though to take to flight. It was the voice of Lizette, chanting the death song of the Sioux.

An hour later, once more in force, the band was gathered for its rush upon the ranch. Jake,
gallant fellow, lay bleeding at his post. Hope of every kind was well-nigh dead. The silence
without was only portent of the storm so soon to burst. Pappoose, grasping her brother's rifle,
crouched facing the narrow entrance to the cellar. Jessie clung to the baby, for Mrs. Hal,
only dimly conscious, was moaning by her husband's side, while Lizette in silence was kneeling,
watching them with strange glitter in her eyes. Suddenly she started, and with hand to ear,
listened intently. Then she sprang to an air port and crouched there, quivering. Then again
the ground began to tremble under the distant thunder of pony feet, louder and louder every
second. Again came the rush of the Indian braves, but with it no exultant yell, only cries
of warning, and as this sound swept over and beyond their walls, there followed another, the
distant, deep-throated trooper cheer, the crack of carbine, the rising thunder of the cavalry
gallop, and then the voice of Ned Lannion rang jubilantly over the dull clamor. 

A dispatch from the Headquarters Staff of the Commander in Chief says:

At
the beginning of March, (Old Style,) in the principal chain of the
Carpathians, we only held the region of the Dukla Pass, where our
lines formed an exterior angle. Here is only my corpse: my soul is far away."

"It seems that your senses often take the whim of walking I know not
where, dear Ammalát. Are you not well at Verkhóffsky's--free and
contented? beloved as a younger brother, caressed like a bride? Official records, however,
limited the number of officers and men engaged to a select few, consisting entirely of Lieutenant
Loring, United States Engineers, Lieutenant Loomis, --th Infantry, a few men from scattered
troops, "pickups" at Frayne and Emory, with Lieutenant Marshall Dean and fifty rank and file
of Company "C."

Loring, it will be remembered, had taken a small detachment from Emory and gone into the hills
in search of Burleigh. Loomis, fretting at the fort, was later electrified by a most grudgingly
given order to march to the Laramie and render such aid as might be required by the engineer
officer of the department. Dean, with only fifteen men all told, had dashed from Frayne straight
for the ranch, and, marching all night, had come in sight of the valley just as it was lighted
afar to the eastward by the glare of the burning buildings. "We thought it was all over," said
he, as he lay there weak and languid, a few days later, for the wound reopened in the rush
of the fight, "but we rode on to the Laramie, and there, God be thanked! fell in with Loomis
here and "C" Troop, heading for the fire. No words can tell you our joy when we found the ranch
still standing and some forty Sioux getting ready for the final dash. That running fight, past
the old home, and down the valley where we stirred up Loring's besiegers and sent them whirling
too--why, I'd give a fortune, if I had it, to live it over again!"

But Loring, after all, had the most thrilling story to tell--of how he wormed a clew to Burleigh's
hiding place out of a captured outlaw and beat up the party in a nook of the hills, nabbed
the major asleep, but was warned that all the Birdsall "outfit" would rally to the rescue,
and so sent a courier to Emory for "C" Troop, and, making wide détour to avoid the gang, ran
slap into the Sioux in the act of firing Folsom's ranch. Then he had to take to the rocks in
the fight that followed, and had a desperate siege of a few hours, even Burleigh having to
handle a gun and fight for his life. "I spotted him for a coward that day we stumbled on Red
Cloud's band up by the Big Horn. You remember it, Dean, I thought him a villain when I learned
how he was trying to undermine you. Time proved him a thief and a scoundrel, but, peace to
his ashes, he died like a gentleman after all, with two Indian bullets through him, and just
as rescue came. He had time to make full confession, and it was all pretty much as I suspected.
The note Dean picked up at Reno, that so stampeded him, told how a blackmailing scoundrel was
on his way to Emory to expose him unless headed off by further huge payments. It was the fellow
who called himself Newhall."

"The fellow who gave the tip to Birdsall's people?" said old Folsom at this juncture, raising
a bandaged head from his daughter's lap. "Who was he, really?"

"Burleigh knew all the time and I suspected the moment I heard Miss Folsom's description, and
was certain the instant I laid eyes on him. He was a rascally captain cashiered at Yuma the
year before, and I was judge advocate of the court."

"And Mrs. Fletcher?" asked Pappoose, extending one hand to Jess, while the other smoothed the
gray curls on her fathers forehead.

"Mrs. Fletcher was his deserted wife, one of­ those women who have known better days."

The ranch is still there, or was twenty years ago, but even then the Sioux were said to raise
more hair in the neighborhood than Folsom did cattle. POTATO CROQUETTES.

MRS. J. G. SCOTT.

of melted butter and three eggs, make into rolls, cover with cracker
dust, or bread crumbs and fry.

KIDNEY STEW.

MRS. SEPTIMUS BARROW. The first time its chronicler ever saw it was in company with a stalwart
young captain of horse and his dark-eyed, beautiful wife nine years after the siege. Hal met
us, a shy, silent fellow, despite his inches. "Among other things," said he, "Lieutenant and
Mrs. Loomis are coming next week. I wish you might all be here to meet them."

"I know," said Mrs. Dean, "we are to meet at Cheyenne. But, Hal, where's your wife?"

He looked shyer still. "She don't like to meet folks unless----"

"There's no unless about it," said the lady with all her old decision as she sprang from the
ambulance, and presently reappeared, leading by the hand, reluctant, yet not all unhappy, Lizette.
Some people said Hal Folsom had no business to marry an Indian girl before his wife was dead
three years, but all who knew Lizette said he did perfectly right, at least Pappoose did, and
that settled it. As for Loring--But that's enough for one story.

THE END.
