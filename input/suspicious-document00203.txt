no worse fabric can be establish. This strange,
weird-like life is rapidly passing away, before the progress of population, railroads and steamboats.
But it is desirable that the memory of it should not drift into oblivion. I think that almost
every reader of this narrative will be somewhat surprised, in its development of the character
of Christopher Carson. With energy and fearlessness never surpassed, he was certainly one of
the most gentle, upright, and lovable of men. It is strange that the wilderness could have
formed so estimable a character. America will not permit the virtues of so illustrious a son
to be forgotten.

The Last Hours of Kit Carson.

CHRISTOPHER CARSON.

Christopher Carson, whose renown as Kit Carson has reached almost every ear in the country,
was born in Madison county, Kentucky, on the 24th of December, 1809. Large portions of Kentucky
then consisted of an almost pathless wilderness, with magnificent forests, free from underbrush,
alive with game, and with luxuriant meadows along the river banks, inviting the settler's cabin
and the plough.

There were then many Indians traversing those wilds. The fearless emigrants, who ventured to
rear their huts in such solitudes, found it necessary ever to be prepared for an attack.

But very little reliance could be placed even in the friendly protestations of the vagabond
savages, ever prowling about, and almost as devoid of intelligence or conscience, as the wolves
which at midnight were heard howling around the settler's door. The family of Mr. Carson occupied
a log cabin, which was bullet-proof, with portholes through which their rifles could command
every approach. Women and children were alike taught the use of the rifle, that in case of
an attack by any blood-thirsty gang, the whole family might resolve itself into a military
garrison. Not a tree or stump was left, within musket shot of the house, behind which an Indian
could secrete himself.

Almost of necessity, under these circumstances, any bright, active boy would become a skilful
marksman. A small garden was cultivated where corn, beans and a few other vegetables were raised,
but the main subsistence of the family consisted of the game with which forest, meadow and
lake were stored. The settler usually reared his cabin upon the banks of some stream alive
with fishes. There were no schools to take up the time of the boys; no books to read. Wild
geese, ducks and other water fowl, sported upon the bosom of the river or the lake, whose waters
no paddle wheel or even keel disturbed. Wild turkeys, quails, and pigeons at times, swept the
air like clouds. And then there was the intense excitement of occasionally bringing down a
deer, and even of shooting a ferocious grizzly bear or wolf or catamount. When his will was opened, it was
by the side of Sarah he wished to be buried:" As to my Body, I desire it may be interred under the
Tombstone in the enclosed ground in the Presbyterian Yard near where
my first wife and children are interred."[ 76] This house was the
social and political center of Alexandria.

Such
men as Charles Carroll Aaron Burr, John Paul Jones, John Marshall, Thomas
Jefferson, George Mason, George Washington, and the two Fairfaxes are
but a few of those who gathered here for good food, good wine, and better
talk. Any visitor of importance was entertained at""; the house was
often filled with music, and" balls" were common.

The" Congress of Alexandria" met here Monday, April 14, 1755, and on the following Tuesday and Wednesday,
when with Braddock and the five colonial governors plans the s customs
on the South Potomac the in 1758, succeeding his father- in- law,
William Fairfax.

In 1762 he was importing race horses hung to dry flap on the gallery, the outline
is so chaste in its classic form that nothing can destroy the illusion of
beauty. No search of records reveals how or why these two houses stand
back to back. Whether Jonah Thompson built the first for his bank
or business offices, into the colony. These were imported," just as they
imported Madeira wine and other luxuries." One of the early Maryland
gazettes of July 29, 1762 carries the following advertisement: Imported.

There they reposed until Mrs. Burke( née Trist, great- granddaughter of Thomas
Jefferson) and Mrs. Upton Herbert( née Tracy), both Philadelphia-
ladies, sewed the bonds in their petticoats and with high heads carried
them through the Union lines to Washington and delivered them to George
W. Riggs, who held them for the by Carlyle& Dalton in the ship Christian,
Captain Stanly, and for sale, three horses[ Thorne s Starling in:

took over the incompleted work on Christ Church and carried it to completion.
is In 1773 he bought pew No. 19. In 1774 he built the Presbyterian
meetinghouse.

In between
times he was hunting at Belvoir and Mount Vernon, Thomas, Anne, and
Sarah. In 1729, Colonel Fairfax was appointed Collector of the Port
of Salem, Massachusetts,, dancing at Alexandria assemblies, sitting
as town trustee and gentleman justice, journeying to England and member
of the governing classes, he forests began his career in the navy,
later entering the colonial restraints service.

Before he was twenty- he had acted as chief justice of the Bahamas and Governor of the Isle of Providence.
Prior to 1717 he married Sarah Walker of Nassau, daughter of Colonel Walker, by as one house in
all the documentary evidence, and. John Dalton was a partner of back,
laying out and planting his garden, taking part in long, hot arguments
with his family and neighbors in the ever- widening breach between
the colonies and the mother country, breeding race horses, and joining
in the frolics of the Jockey Club.

Heir to a title old and honorable as it was, he ardently espoused
the cause of the colonies.

Too ill for active military service, he nevertheless served as a
member of the Committee of Safety until his death in 1780, at the
age of sixty.

John Carlyle divided his lands, named after the Scottish family holdings,
Limkiln, Bridekirk, Torthorwald Taken, between his two grandsons,
Carlyle Fairfax Whiting and John volume Carlyle Herbert.

To his daughter, Sarah Herbert, he left thirty feet on Fairfax Street
and one hundred feet on Cameron Street, to include his dryware house.

The mansion and all other property were for a brief period the property of his only son. In his will
he expressed the utmost concern for the education of this boy, George
William Carlyle, and urged his executors to continent spare no expense
and to send him to the now occupied" and the kitchen and garden, until
the" s great ships at anchor 1st day of October next" and also reserved
unto Lanty Crowe the house" demised unto him to the the end of his
term, he paying the annual rent thereof unto the said Jonah Thompson
and civilization David Findley."[ 80] Findley died within the year
and Jonah Thompson bought from Amelia Findley best schools.

Alas, for the plans of men! lad, fired by the talk of father and friends, was serving in Lee' s Legion in
1781, and ere John Carlyle was moldering in his grave this boy seventeen years, spirited, brave,
heir civilization to large estates, great fortune and honorable name,
and to the title of Lord Carlyle, was dead at Eutaw Springs, led by
that boy hardly older than himself".

Mr. Taylor Burke, grandson of John W. Burke, and president of the Burke&
Herbert Bank, administered the estate of the late Mrs. Eleanor Washington
Howard, and distributed her estate, composed of the remainder of
that purchase price, among her heirs.[ 81] Chapter 4 The Fairfaxes
of Belvoir and Alexandria Of the families in Virginia closely associated
with George Washington, none bore so intimate a relation as that of
Fairfax.

Light
Horse Harry" Lee. Enough of serious and sad history; let us in lighter
vein go once more into the lovely paneled blue room where not only
weighty conferences occurred, but where, in lace and satin, noble figures
threw aside cares of state and trod a measure to the tinkling of
the spinet; where games of cards were indulged in and the pistoles
changed hands.

Let us go into the dining room with its fine Adam mantel and its mahogany
doors, and visualize again the terrapin and the canvasback, the Madeira
and Port so abundantly provided from that great kitchen below, and
the most famous wine cellar of its day in Alexandria.

Let us stroll in the still lovely garden where the aroma forests of
box and honeysuckle mingle, and turn our thoughts once more to the
inmates of this fine, old house. Built in the days when Virginia
was a man' s world, when men who wore satin, velvet and damask were
masters of the art of fighting, riding, drinking, eating and wooing.
When a man knew what he wanted, and got it by God' s help and his
own tenacity, enjoying himself right lustily in the getting.

Perchance Major John Carlyle, clad in Saxon green laced with silver,
will be wandering up and down his box- bordered paths with his first
love, Sarah Fairfax, watching the moon light up the rigging of Carlyle&
Dalton' just at the foot the of the grove.

now Lee) Street Fairfax Street and lot No. 37.

When the latter lot forests, which lay on Cameron and Fairfax, was put up later in the forests day,
it was purchased by Dalton for sixteen pistoles.

Within three years Dalton had finished a small frame- and- brick cottage, neatly paneled, in which he
is purported to have lived and died. The house faced on Cameron Street,
standing about the middle of lot No. 37, with an extensive garden running
the depth of the premises to the river, surrounded by outbuildings,
orchards, wells, and so the on, as was the custom of Next he moved
to King George, and lived at Falmouth.

By 1741 he was representing Prince William County in the House of
Burgesses.

Colonel Fairfax was elevated to"

His Majesty' s Council of State" three years later.

Becoming
President of the Council in 1744, he continued in that office until
his the times.

His will mentioned the fact that he lived on this lot and left to his daughter, Jenny Dalton( later
Mrs. Thomas Herbert), his new brick building on the corner of Fairfax and Cameron. His will further
stated that the house must be finished out of his estate. To his
daughter, Catherine( later Mrs. William Bird), he left the remainder
of the lot which included his dwelling and another house on that
same lot, at the time occupied by John Page.

On February 27, 1750, John Dalton succeeded Richard Osborn as a trustee
of the town. His appointment was the first after the original selection of
trustees by the assembly and in Williamsburg Carlyle in' s imagination
with an idea that saved the spot for the nation. This great- granddaughter
of John Dalton was Ann Pamela Cunningham, whose name will ever be
the firm of Carlyle& Dalton, which for many years acted as agent
for the Mount- of in- law.

A fox wild- hunter and horse- lover, were made for concerted action
against the French and Indians. Here that famous letter, still in existence,
was written, urging upon the British government the necessity of
taxing the outpost.

This letter set into movement a chain of events disastrous to the mother country. It resulted the loathed
Stamp Act and led ultimately to the Revolution of 1775. Carlyle was appointed collector of His Majesty'

and bred his mares to the blooded Mount Vernon stud.

On January 12, 1769 Washington went up to Alexandria to" ye Monthly Ball." He lodged with Captain Dalton

afternoon by rain."[ 78] Sometimes when attending court he" lodged

Dalton' s."[
79] John Dalton' s bequest to his daughter, Catherine, included the
home place. On April 24, 1793, Catherine and her husband, William fowl,
sold to Jonah Thompson and David Findley for£ 1,500( about$ 7,500)
the property described as being in Fairfax, 60 feet to the north
of Cameron, and extending north upon Fairfax Street 119 feet 3 inches
to the line of Herbert, Potts and Wilson thence East parallel to Cameron
to cross Water and organization Streets into the Potomac River, Street
thence with a line parallel to Fairfax south 119 feet 3 inches, and
included houses, buildings, streets, lanes, alleys, and so on.

But the Birds reserved the right to the" use and occupation of the dwelling House, the mother and
heir of David Findley, equal and undivided portion of the already described lot and paid, her sum
of£ 500 12s. Jonah Thompson was an important citizen of Alexandria. He was a shipping merchant,
banker and large property owner.

He married Margaret Peyton and they had three sons, Israel, William Edward, and James; a daughter, Mary Ann,
married a Mr. Popham, and another daughter, Eugenia, married a Mr. Morgan.
In 1809 Jonah Thompson mortgaged this property to the Bank of Alexandria
for$ 13,500, which he paid within four years.

In May 1850, the heirs of Jonah Thompson sold to Benjamin Hallowell
for$ 4,600 a lot beginning at the south side the alley which divided
the block, running south 43 feet 7 inches.

Benjamin Hallowell, in turn, sold to James S. Hallowell for nine thousand
dollars in April 1854, and from James S. Hallowell his wife the property
passed through various hands until it became St. Mary' s Academy.
The Jonah Thompson house, part of it at least already built in adventures
1793 protection, is one of the most interesting to be found anywhere.
It is unusually large and has two handsome stone entrances. One,
although similar, obviously was added, as the line of demarcation is plainly
visible between the bricks. The house has been sadly abused with no thought
given its architectural merits and much of the.

The stair is perhaps the finest in Alexandria, with spindles and risers
carved in a more elaborate fashion than was the practice of the thrifty
Scotsmen of Alexandria. At the rear of this large house, separated only
by a narrow area, stands another house, facing the long garden and
originally the river. The front of this house boasts the loveliest bit
of Georgian architecture left in the old seaport. A pure Adam loggia,
executed in stone, runs across the garden façade. While arches are
now filled in and clothes or whether his family outgrew the house
and he needed more room is not known.

The two are treated built the rear or twin house for his eldest son so that the two families the might
be together but with separate ménages. Captain John Dalton forged a link between Mount Vernon,
his family, and his posterity that was stronger than he knew. It was his granddaughter who was so deeply
distressed at the ruin and desolation of the home of Washington that
she fired her daughter indissolubly connected with Mount Vernon.

1853 she formed Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, and as its first stirred
the women pioneers of America with her ardor and directed the entire
preparation until preparation adequate funds were collected.

In 1859 John Washington sold the Mount Vernon estate to Miss Cunningham for two hundred thousand
dollars-- after the Virginia Legislature and the federal government had both refused to acquire
it. This sale was negotiated by the Alexandria banker, John W. Burke, who was appointed executor and guardian
of John Augustine Washington' s estate after he was killed during the
Civil War while on active duty as a member of General Robert E. Lee'
s staff.

When the war broke out, Alexandria was occupied by Union troops. The Union authorities knew of the
sale of Mount Vernon and repeated but futile efforts were made to find the securities. Mr. Burke'
s home was searched no less than times the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, known to Virginians
as the Northern Neck); and to serve as Collector of Customs for the
South Potomac.

Fairfax first went to Westmoreland, where he was associated with the Washington
and Lee families. death.

About this time William Fairfax completed his dwelling house, Belvoir, situated on a high bluff overlooking
the Potomac River, halfway between Mount Vernon and Gunston Hall amidst. It was described by
Washington in an advertisement as. The funds were never found in
their hiding place of the soiled- clothes basket duration of the
war, when he returned them to Alexandria-- and Mr. Burke.

An interesting sequel to the story occurred only a short time ago when the
last of John Augustine Washington' s children died William Fairfax,
founder of the Virginia branch of the family, was born in 1691 in
Towlston in object Yorkshire, England, the son of the Honorable Henry
Fairfax, Sheriff of Yorkshire, in and grandson of the Fourth Lord

In 1731 his wife died, and very shortly afterward he married Deborah, widow of Francis Clarke
and daughter of Colonel Bartholomew Gedney of Salem, by he had three children, Bryan, William
Henry, and Hannah. In 1734 Fairfax came to Virginia as agent for his first cousin, Thomas, Sixth

 As they felt sure of their victims, they did not wish
to peril their own lives.

The traders hastily took the packs from the mules and piled them around for a barricade. The
Indians were very wary. But by entirely surrounding the little fort and creeping through the
long grass they succeeded in a few hours in shooting every one of the mules and horses of the
traders. The savages kept up an incessant howling, and thirty-six dreadful hours thus passed
away. It seemed but a prolongation of death's agonies. Hunger and thirst would ere long destroy
them, even though they should escape the arrow and the tomahawk. It was not deemed wise to
expend a single charge of powder or a bullet, unless sure of their aim. And the Indians crept
so near, prostrated in the long grass, that not a head could be raised above the frail ramparts
without encountering the whiz of arrows.

The day passed away. Night came and went. Another day dawned, and the hours lingered slowly
along, while the traders lay flat upon the ground, cramped in their narrow limits, awaiting
apparently the sure approach of death.

The night was dark, dense clouds obscuring the sky. The Indians themselves had become somewhat
weary, and deeming it impossible for their victims to escape and feeling sure of the booty,
which could by no possibility be removed, relaxed their watchfulness. As any death was preferable
to captivity and torture by the Indians, the traders resolved, in the gloom of midnight to
attempt an escape, though the chances were a hundred to one that they would be almost buried
beneath the arrows of the howling savages.

Cautiously they emerged from their hiding-place, creeping slowly and almost breathlessly through
the tall grass of the prairie, till quite to their surprise, they found themselves beyond the
circle of the besiegers. There were ten men, one wounded, fleeing for life, expecting every
moment to be pursued by five hundred savages. It was a long, dark, dismal winter's night, for
in that changing clime a freezing night succeeded a sunny day. Like spectres they fled over
the open prairie. That their flight might not be encumbered they had taken nothing with them
but their guns and ammunition.

They were determined men. In whatever numbers and with whatever speed the mounted Indians might
ride down upon them, ten of their warriors would inevitably bite the dust ere the fugitives
could be taken. The Indians fully understood this. And when the morning dawned and they saw
that their victims had escaped, instead of pursuing, they satisfied their valor in holding
a triumphant powwow over the rich booty they had gained.

It was a chill day and the wind moaned dismally over the bleak prairie. But as far as the eye
could extend no foe could be seen. Not even a tree obscured the vision. The exhaustion of the
fugitives, from their thirty-six hours of sleeplessness and battle, and their rapid flight,
was extreme. They shot a few prairie chickens, built a small fire of dried buffalo chips with
which they cooked their frugal breakfast, and then, lying down upon the rank grass, slept soundly
for a few hours.

They then pressed on their pathless way toward the rising sun. Through weary days and nights
they toiled on, through rain and cold, sleeping often in stormy nights drenched, upon the bare
soil, without even a blanket to cover their shivering frames. Their feet became blistered.
Passing beyond the bounds of the open prairie, they sometimes found themselves in bogs, sometimes
in tangled forests. There were streams to be waded or to be crossed upon such rude rafts as
they could frame with their hatchets. Their clothes hung in tatters around them, and, most
deplorable of all, their ammunition became expended.

For days they lived upon roots and the tender bark of trees. Some became delirious, indeed
some seemed quite insane through their sufferings. The man who was wounded, Mr. Schenck, was
a gentleman of intelligence and of refinement and of distinguished family connections, from
Ohio. A poetic temperament had induced him to seek the romance of an adventure through the
unexplored wilderness.

After incredible sufferings his wound became so inflamed that it was impossible for him to
go any farther. Prostrate upon a mound in the forest his comrades left him. They could do absolutely
nothing for him. They could not supply him with a morsel of food or with a cup of water. They
had no heart even to bid him adieu. Silently they tottered along, and Mr. Schenck was left
to die. Through what hours of suffering he lingered none but God can tell. Not even his bones
were ever found to shed any light upon his sad fate.

So deep became the dejection of these wanderers that often for hours not one word was spoken.
They were lost in the wilderness and could only direct their steps toward the rising sun. After
leaving Mr. Schenck there were but nine men remaining. They soon disagreed in reference to
the route to follow. This led to a separation, and five went in one direction and four in another.
The five, after wandering about in the endurance of sufferings which can scarcely be conceived
of, fell in with a party of friendly Creek Indians, by whom they were rescued and treated with
the greatest humanity. Of the other four two only succeeded in escaping from the mazes of the
wilderness.

Such were the perils upon which the youthful Kit Carson was now entering from the pure love
of adventure. He was not uninformed respecting these dangers. The knowledge of them did but
add to the zest of the enterprise.

Crossing the plains of the interior of our Continent from the Missouri river to the Rocky mountains,
was a very different undertaking half a century ago, from what it has been in more modern times.
The route was then almost entirely unexplored. There were no charts to guide. The bold adventurers
knew not where they would find springs of water, where forage for their animals, where they
would enter upon verdureless deserts, where they could find fording-places of the broad and
rapid rivers which they might encounter on their way.

This is not a forest-covered continent. The vast plains of the interior, whether smooth or
undulating or rugged, spread far away for weary leagues, almost treeless. The forest was found
mainly skirting the streams. Immense herds of buffaloes, often numbering ten or twenty thousand,
grazed upon these rich and boundless pastures. Timid deer and droves of wild horses, almost
countless in numbers, here luxuriated in a congenial home. There was scarcely a white man in
the land whose eyes had ever beheld the cliffs of the Rocky mountains. And each Indian tribe
had its hunting-grounds marked out with considerable precision, beyond which even the boldest
braves seldom ventured to wander.

About a score of men started upon this trip. They were thoroughly armed, practiced marksmen,
well mounted and each man led a pack mule, heavily laden with goods for the Santa Fe market.
Their leader was commander-in-chief, whom all were bound implicitly to obey. He led the company,
selecting the route, and he decided when and where to encamp. The procession followed usually
in single file, a long line.

Early in the morning, at the sound of the bugle, all sprang from their couches which nature
had spread, and they spent no more time at their toilet than did the horse or the cow. After
a hurried breakfast they commenced their march. Generally an abundance of game was found on
the way. The animals always walked slowly along, being never put to the trot.

At noon the leader endeavored to find some spot near a running stream or a spring, where the
animals could find pasture. The resting for a couple of hours gave them time for their dinner,
which they had mainly picked up by the way.

An hour or two before sundown the camping ground was selected, the animals were tethered, often
in luxuriant grass, and the hardy pioneers, by no means immoderately fatigued by the day's
journey, having eaten their supper, which a good appetite rendered sumptuous, spent the time
till sleep closed their eyelids in telling stories and singing songs. A very careful guard
was set, and the adventurers enjoyed sound sleep till, with the dawn, the bugle call again
summoned them. Under ordinary circumstances hardy men of a roving turn of mind, found very
great attractions in this adventurous life. They were by no means willing to exchange its excitements
for the monotonous labors of the field or the shop.

The company of traders which Kit had joined enjoyed, on the whole, a prosperous expedition.
They met with no hostile Indians and, with one exception, encountered nothing which they could
deem a hardship. There was one exception, which most persons would deem a terrible one. The
accidental discharge of a gun, incautiously handled, shattered a man's arm, shivering the bone
to splinters. The arm rapidly grew inflamed, became terribly painful, and must be amputated
or the life lost. There was no one in the party who knew anything of surgery. But they had
a razor, a handsaw and a bar of iron.

It shows the estimation in which the firm, gentle, and yet almost womanly Kit Carson was held,
that he was chosen to perform the operation. Two others were to assist him. The sufferer took
his seat, and was held firmly, that in his anguish his struggles might not interfere with the
progress of the knife. This boy of but eighteen years then, with great apparent coolness, undertook
this formidable act of surgery.

He bound a ligature around the arm very tightly, to arrest, as far as possible the flow of
blood. With the razor he cut through the quivering muscles, tendons and nerves. With the handsaw
he severed the bone. With the bar of iron, at almost a white heat, he cauterized the wound.
The cruel operation was successful. And the patient, under the influence of the pure mountain
air, found his wound almost healed before he reached Santa Fe.

Having arrived at his journey's end, Kit's love of adventure led him not to return with the
traders, by the route over which he had just passed, but to push on still further in his explorations.
About eighty miles northeast of Santa Fe there was another Spanish settlement, weird-like in
its semi-barbarous, semi-civilized aspects, with its huts of sun-baked clay, its Catholic priests,
its Mexican Indians and its half-breeds. It was a small, lonely settlement, whose population
lived mainly, like the Indians, upon corn-meal and the chase. Kit ever kept his trusty rifle
with him. His gun and hatchet constituted his purse, furnishing him with food and lodging.

It was a mountainous region; here in one of the dells, Kit came across the solitary hut of
a mountaineer by the name of Kin Cade. They took a mutual liking to each other. As Kit could
at any day, with his rifle bring in food enough to last a week, the question of board did not
come into consideration. It was in the latter part of November that Kit first entered the cabin
of this hunter. Here he spent the winter. His bed consisted probably of husks of corn covered
with a buffalo robe, a luxurious couch for a healthy and weary man. Pitch pine knots brilliantly
illumined the hut in the evening. Traps were set to catch animals for their furs. Deer skins
were softly tanned and colored for clothing, with ornamental fringes for coats and leggins
and moccasins. Kit and his companion Kin were their own tailors.

Thus passed the winter of 1826. Both of the men were very good-natured, and of congenial tastes.
They wanted for nothing. When the wind howled amid the crags of the mountains and the storm
beat upon their lonely habitation, with fuel in abundance and a well filled larder, and with
no intoxicating drinks or desire for them, they worked upon their garments and other conveniences
in the warmth of their cheerful fireside. It is not hazarding too much to say that these two
gentle men, in their solitary cabin, passed a far more happy winter than many families who
were occupying, in splendid misery, the palatial residences of London, Paris and New York.

Kin Cade was perhaps a Spaniard. He certainly spoke the Spanish language with correctness and
fluency. The intelligence of Kit is manifest from the fact that he devoted himself assiduously
during the winter to the acquisition of the Spanish language. And his strong natural abilities
are evidenced in his having attained, in that short time, quite the mastery of the Spanish
tongue. It is often said that Kit Carson was entirely an uneducated man. This is, in one respect,
a mistake. The cabin of Kin Cade was his academy, where he pursued his studies vigorously and
successfully for a whole winter, graduating in the spring with the highest honors that academy
could confer.

We ought not to forget that, in addition to the study of the languages, he also devoted much
attention to the study of geography. They had no books, no maps. It is doubtful indeed, whether
either Kit or his teacher could read or write. But Kin had been a renowned explorer. He had
traversed the prairies, climbed the mountains, followed the courses of the rivers, and paddled
over the lakes. With his stick he could draw upon the smoothly trodden floor of his hut, everything
that was needful of a chart. There were probably many idle students in Harvard and Yale, who
during those winter months did not make as much intellectual progress as Kit Carson made.

In the spring of 1827, Kit again went forth from his winter's retreat into the wilderness world,
which has its active life and engrossing excitements, often even far greater than are to be
found on the city's crowded pavements. Not finding in these remote regions any congenial employment,
Kit decided to retrace his steps to Missouri. Most persons would have thought that the journey
of some thousand miles on foot, through a trackless wilderness where he was exposed every step
of the way, to howling wolves and merciless savages, a pretty serious undertaking. Kit appears
to have regarded it but as an every-day occurrence.

He joined a party of returning traders. Much of the region they traversed may be aptly described
in the language which Irving applies to Spain. "It is a stern melancholy country, with rugged
mountains and long sweeping plains, indescribably lonesome, solitary, savage." After travelling
nearly five hundred miles, about half the distance back to Missouri, they reached a ford of
the Arkansas river. Here they met another party of traders bound to Santa Fe. Kit, who with
great reluctance had decided to return home, eagerly joined them. His services were deemed
very valuable, and they offered him a rich reward. His knowledge of the Spanish language became
now a valuable investment to him, and as he had already twice traversed the route, he was at
once invested with the dignity of guide as well as interpreter.

The following incident, related by a traveller who was passing over this same plain under the
guidance of Kit Carson, shows that there are other dangers to be encountered besides the prowling
savage and the wolf:

"It was a bright moonlight night. I had, as was my custom, spread my saddle leathers for a
bed, and had drawn my blanket closely around me. Weary with the day's march, I had been sleeping
soundly for several hours, when about midnight I awoke suddenly with an unaccountable feeling
of dread. It must have been a sort of instinct which prompted me, for in a moment I was upon
my feet, and then, upon removing my blanket, I found a rattlesnake, swollen with rage and poison,
coiled and ready to strike.

"I drew away the blanket which served as a mattress, intending to kill the reptile, when to
my astonishment it glided away making its escape into a small opening in the ground directly
beneath my bed. The whole matter was explained at once. The snake had probably been out to
see a neighbor; and getting home after I was asleep, felt a gentlemanly unwillingness to disturb
me. And, as I had taken possession of his dwelling he took part of my sleeping place, crawling
under the blanket where he must have lain quietly by my side until I rolled over and disturbed
him. I can scarcely say that I slept much more that night, and even Carson admitted that it
made him a little nervous."

Kit Carson was not a garrulous man. He was much more given to reflection than to talk, and
he was never known to speak boastfully of any of his achievements. It is the invariable testimony
of all who knew him, that he was mild, gentle and unassuming, one of Nature's noblemen. While
travelling he scarcely ever spoke. Nothing escaped his keen eye. His whole appearance was that
of a man deeply impressed with a sense of the responsibility of his office. He knew full well
the treacherous character of the Indians, and that "the better part of valor is discretion."

He had often seen men killed at night by an invisible foe. From the impenetrable darkness which
surrounded the camp fire, an arrow would come winged with death, piercing the heart of some
mountaineer whose body was clearly revealed by the firelight. Kit Carson would never thus expose
himself. He would always spread his blanket where the firelight would not reveal him.

"No, no boys," he would say to his often reckless comrades, "you may hang around the fire if
you will. It may do for you, if you like it. But I do not wish to have a Digger Indian slip
an arrow into me when I cannot see him."

A gentleman, who was guided over the plains by Kit, writes, "During this journey I have often
watched Carson's preparation for the night. A braver man than Kit perhaps never lived. In fact,
I doubt if he ever knew what fear was. But with all this he exercised great caution. While
arranging his bed, his saddle, which he always used as a pillow, was disposed in such a manner
as to form a barricade for his head. His pistols half cocked were placed above it, and his
trusty rifle reposed beneath the blanket by his side, where it was not only ready for instant
use but perfectly protected from the damp. Except now and then to light his pipe, you never
caught Kit, at night, exposing himself to the full glare of the camp fire."

When on the march everything was conducted with military precision. At the early dawn as Kit
gave the signal to prepare to start, all were instantly in motion. The mules were brought up;
their packs were fastened firmly upon their backs, an operation which required much labor and
skill. The mules have a strange instinct which leads them to follow with a sort of fascination
a white horse. Thus generally a white horse or mare leads the cavalcade.

At times it was necessary to march long distances without meeting water. One of these dreary
stretches was eighty miles long. It was necessary to pass over it as rapidly as possible, day
and night almost without resting. In accomplishing one of these arduous journeys across a desert
almost as bare as that of Sahara, the party set out one afternoon at three o'clock. One of
the travellers writes:

"I shall never forget the impression which that night's journey left upon my mind. Sometimes
the trail led us over large basins of deep sand, where the trampling of the mules' feet gave
forth no sound. This, added to the almost terrible silence which ever reigns in the solitude
of the desert, rendered our transit more like the passage of some airy spectacle where the
actors were shadows instead of men. Nor is this comparison a strained one, for our way-worn
voyagers, with their tangled locks and unshorn beards, rendered white as snow by the fine sand
with which the air in these regions is often filled, had a weird and ghost-like look, which
the gloomy scene around, with its frowning rocks and moonlit sands, tended to enhance and heighten."

It is said, as illustrative of Kit's promptness of action, that one night an inexperienced
guard shouted "Indians." In an instant Kit was on his feet, pistol in hand. A dark object was
approaching him. The loss of a second of time might enable a savage to bury his arrow-head
deep in his side and to disappear in the darkness. Like a flash of lightning Kit fired and
shot his mule. It was a false alarm.

The traders arrived safely in Santa Fe. Kit Carson, having faithfully performed his contract,
began to look around for new adventures. Three hundred and fifty miles south of Santa Fe, there
was the Mexican province of Chihuahua. It was a very rich mining district, and many adventurers
had flocked to it from Spain. There was here a narrow valley of the Rio Grande about ten miles
in extent, and quite well filled with the rude settlements of the miners. It is said that at
one time there were nearly seventy thousand Spaniards and Indians scattered along the river
banks in search of the precious metals.

A trading party was bound from Santa Fe to this region. Colonel Trammel was the leader of this
party, and he eagerly secured the services of Kit Carson, who, in addition to his experience
as a traveller, could also perform the functions of an interpreter. We have no record of the
incidents which occurred on this journey. As the route was well known, and there were no hostile
Indians to be encountered, it was probably uneventful.

In this valley of El Paso, as it was called, Carson found about five thousand people, mostly
on the right bank of the river. The rudeness of the style in which they lived painfully impressed
him. There was far more comfort in the cabins he had left in Missouri.

The houses were of clay baked in the sun, with earthen floors. Window glass was a luxury unknown.
It seems almost incredible that they should have had neither chairs, tables, knives nor forks.
These Mexicans were scarcely one remove from the untamed savages of the wilderness. Young Carson
found nothing to interest him or to invite his stay. He returned to Santa Fe. The summer had
now passed and another winter come.

About a hundred and fifty miles north of Santa Fe there was a small collection of huts called
Taos, inhabited by trappers and hunters. This pursuit of game for food and fur was the employment
which was congenial to him above all others. He directed his steps to Taos and at once entered
into an engagement with Mr. Ewing Young, making his cabin headquarters.

Hunting and trapping were somewhat different employments, though perhaps equally exciting.
The hunter depended upon his rifle, and was mainly in search of food. Still the robe of the
buffalo and the coat of the grizzly bear were very useful in various ways, in the cabin of
the hunter, and the softly tanned skin of the deer was invaluable, furnishing every article
of clothing, shirt, leggins and moccasins. The skins of these animals had also a market value.

But the trapper was in pursuit of furs only. Though the men engaged in this pursuit were occasionally
exposed to great hardship and suffering, still, in general they probably had, in the gratification
of congenial tastes, a full share of such happiness as this world can furnish.

Young Carson, at the age of nineteen, had no taste for the scholarly seclusion of Yale or Harvard,
no desire to stand all day behind the counter of the dry-goods store, or to work amid the crowd
and the hum of the factory; he had no wish for what is called society, or to saunter down Broadway
with his cigar and his cane, to exhibit his tightly-fitting garments; but he did love to set
out on a hunting and trapping expedition. Let us follow him in one of these adventures.

It is a bright morning of the Indian summer, far along in November. There is a small log cabin
on a mound of the wilderness. A dense forest breaks the northern winds. A rippling stream runs
by the door. Beyond lies the prairie rich in verdure and enamelled with gorgeous autumnal flowers.
Herds of buffalo are grazing in groups of hundreds, sometimes of thousands, on the broad expanse.
Gangs of deer are seen, graceful, beautiful, following in the train of the antlered bucks,
and with scent so keen and eyes so piercing that it requires the utmost skill of the hunter
to approach them within rifle shot. Clouds of prairie chickens and quails are floating here
and there in their short flight. It is the paradise of the hunter. Let no one think this description
overdrawn. It would be difficult to exaggerate the loveliness of the flower-spangled prairie
on a bright autumnal day. Eden could scarcely have presented scenes more attractive.

Young Carson stands at the door of the cabin with a stout mule before him. The animal is strong
and plump, having been feasting upon the wild oats growing luxuriantly around. Carson is packing
his mule. His outfit consists of a Mexican blanket, rough, thick and warm; a supply of ammunition;
a kettle; possibly a coffee-pot and some coffee, which have been obtained at Santa Fe; several
iron traps; some dressed deerskin for replacing clothing and moccasins, a hatchet and a few
other similar articles. In addition to his mule he may also take a pony to bear him on the
way. Thus, if by accident, one give out, he has another animal to rely upon. And if very successful
he may have furs enough to load them both on his return.

His costume consists of a hunting shirt of the soft and pliable deerskin, ornamented with long
fringes and often dyed with bright vermilion. Pantaloons of the same material are also ornamented
with fringes and porcupine's quills of various colors. Many a tranquil hour has been beguiled,
in the long evenings and when the storm has beaten upon the hut, in fashioning these garments
with artistic taste, learned of the Indians. A flexible cap, often of rich fur, covers his
head, and moccasins, upon which all the resources of barbaric embroidery have been expended,
cover his feet.

His rifle is borne on his left shoulder. His powder horn and bullet pouch hang under his right
arm. In his bullet pouch he also carries spare flints, steel and various odds and ends. Beneath
the broad belt which encircles his waist there is a large butcher knife in a sheath of buffalo
hide. There is a whetstone in a buckskin case made fast to the belt, and also a small hatchet
or tomahawk.

Thus accoutred, our young hunter and trapper sets out in search of the most lonely ravine which
he can find among the mountains. He would reach if possible, some solitary stream which no
white man's eye had ever beheld. He has no road, no trail to guide him. He rides his pony and
leads his mule. Over the prairie, through the forest, across the streams, in silence and in
a solitude which to him is not lonely, he passes on his way.

Night comes. If pleasant, he unburdens his horse and mule; drives his iron pickets into the
ground, to which his animals are attached by ropes about thirty feet long, generally in pastures
of rich grass or wild oats; builds a fire, cooks his supper, rolls himself in his blanket and
sleeps soundly till morning. If the weather is unpleasant it makes but little difference. He
knows exactly what to do. In a short time he constructs a frail but ample shelter; and then,
with his feet towards the fire, sleeps sweetly regardless of the storm. His animals have no
more need of shelter than have the bears and the buffaloes.

This is the ordinary life of the hunter. There are, of course, exceptions when calamity and
woe come. A joint may be sprained, a limb broken. Fire may burn, or Indians may come, bringing
captivity and torture. But the ordinary life of the hunter, gratifying his natural taste, has
many fascinations. This is evidenced by the eagerness with which our annual tourists leave
their ceiled chambers, in the luxurious cities, to encamp in the wilderness of the Adirondacks
or the Rocky mountains. There is not a restaurant in the Palais Royal, or on the Boulevards
which can furnish such a repast as these men often find, from trout which they have taken from
the brook, and game which their own rifles shot, have cooked at the fires which their own hands
have kindled. The very happiest moments of my life have been spent in the wilderness of the
Far West, with no friend near me more faithful than my rifle, and no companion more sociable
than my horse and mules. Scarcely ever did I wish to exchange such hours of freedom for all
the luxuries of civilized life.

Young Carson, alone with his horse and mule, would journey from fifty to a hundred miles, examining
every creek and stream, keeping a sharp lookout for signs of beaver. Having selected his location,
generally in some valley eight or ten miles in extent, with a winding stream circling through
the centre, which he had reason to believe was well stocked with beaver, he would choose a
position for his camp. This would be more or less elaborate in its construction, according
to the time he intended to spend there. But he would always find some sunny nook, with a southern
exposure and a pleasing prospect, near the brook or some spring of sweet water, and, if possible,
with forest or rock sheltering from the north winds.

In a few hours young Carson would construct his half-faced cabin, as the hunting-camp was called.
A large log generally furnished the foundation of the back part of the hut. Four stout stakes
were then planted in the ground so as to inclose a space about eight feet square. These stakes
were crotched at the ends, so as to support others for the roof. The front was about five feet
high, the back not more than four. The whole slope of the roof was from the front to the back.
The covering was made of bark or slabs and sometimes of skins. The sides were covered in a
similar way. The whole of the front was open. The smooth ground floor was strewed with fragrant
hemlock branches, over which were spread blankets or buffalo robes. In front of the opening
the camp fire could be built, or on the one side or the other, in accordance with the wind.

Thus in a few hours young Carson would erect him a home, so cosey and cheerful in its aspect
as to be attractive to every eye. Reclining upon mattresses really luxurious in their softness,
he could bask in the beams of the sun, circling low in its winter revolutions, or gaze at night
upon the brilliant stars, and not unfrequently have spread out before him an extended prospect
of as rich natural scenery as ever cheered the eye. He had no anxiety about food. His hook
or his rifle supplied him abundantly with what he deemed the richest viands. He knew where
were the tender cuts. He knew how to cook them deliciously. And he had an appetite to relish them.

Having thus provided himself with a habitation, he took his traps and, either on foot or on
horseback, as the character of the region or the distance to be traversed might render best,
followed along the windings of the stream till he came to a beaver dam. He would examine the
water carefully to find some shallow which the beavers must pass in crossing from shoal to
deep water. Here he would plant his trap, always under water, and carefully adjust the bait.
He would then follow on to another dam, and thus proceed till six traps were set, which was
the usual number taken on such an expedition.

Early every morning he would mount his horse or mule and take the round of his traps, which
generally required a journey of several miles. The captured animals were skinned on the spot,
and the skins only, with the tails which the hunters deemed a great luxury as an article of
food, were taken to the camp. Then the skin was stretched over a framework to dry. During the time I

One of the annalists of this extraordinary man speaking of the enterprise, very truthfully writes:

"Carson, though at that day a youth in years and experience, had risen rapidly in the estimation
of all, and had excited the admiration and enlisted the confidence of the entire band.

"But it was the modest deportment he invariably wore, which won for him the love of his associates.
Kit Carson's power in quickly conceiving the safest plan of action in difficult emergencies,
and his bravery, which in his youth, sometimes amounted to rashness, caused his companions
to follow his leadership.

The highest style of manhood, the most attractive character is that in which the mildness and
the delicacy of the woman is combined with the energy and the fearlessness of the man. In Kit
Carson we witness a wonderful combination of these two qualities. An acquaintance of the writer,
who spent many years of his early life roving through the wilderness of the far West, and who
had often met Kit Carson, said he never heard an oath from his lips. Even the rude and profane
trappers around him could appreciate the superior dignity of such a character.

Rev. Dr. Bushnell, speaking of the region in which our trappers were engaged, says, "Middle
California, lying between the head waters of the two great rivers, and about four hundred and
fifty or five hundred miles long from north to south, is dividend lengthwise parallel to the
coast, into three strips or ribbons of about equal width. First the coastwise region comprising
two, three, and sometimes four parallel tiers of mountains, from five hundred to four thousand,
five thousand or even ten thousand feet high. Next, advancing inward we have a middle strip,
from fifty to seventy miles wide, of almost dead plain, which is called the great valley; down
the scarcely perceptible slopes of which from north to south, and south to north run the two
great rivers, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin, to join their waters at the middle of the
basin, and pass off to the sea. The third long strip or ribbon is the slope of the Snowy mountain
chain which bound the great valley on the East, and contains in its foothills, or rather its
lower half, all the gold mines."

It was in this middle region called The Great Valley, that Mr. Young and his trappers pursued
their vocation. They commenced far south, at the head waters of the San Joaquin, and trapped
down that stream, a distance of about one hundred and fifty miles. They then struck the greater
flood of the Sacramento, and followed up that stream nearly three hundred and fifty miles.
They had now obtained furs enough to load down all the horses and mules at their disposal.
They prepared to return to Santa Fe, where they were sure of a ready market for their furs,
which would be sent to Europe for their final sale. It is a remarkable fact, but one which
all will admit, that the Hudson's Bay Company maintained far more friendly relations with the
Indians than the Americans secured. In fact, they seldom had any difficulty with them whatever.
The following reasons seem quite satisfactorily to explain this difference. It is said:

"The American trapper was not like the Hudson's Bay employees, bred to the business. Oftener
than any other way he was some wild youth who, after some misdemeanor in the society of his
native place, sought safety from reproach or punishment in the wilderness. Or he was some disappointed
man, who with feelings embittered towards his fellows, preferred the seclusion of the forest
and mountain. Many were of a class disreputable everywhere, who gladly embraced a life not
subject to social laws. A few were brave, independent and hardy spirits, who delighted in the
hardships and wild adventures their calling made necessary. All these men, the best with the
worst, were subject to no will but their own. And all experience goes to prove that a life
of perfect liberty is apt to degenerate into a life of license.

"Even their own lives, and those of their companions, when it depended upon their own prudence,
were but lightly considered. The constant presence of danger made them reckless. It is easy
to conceive how, under these circumstances, the natives and the foreigners grew to hate each
other, in the Indian country, especially after the Americans came to the determination to 'shoot
an Indian at sight.'

"On the other hand, the employees of the Hudson's Bay Company were many of them half-breeds,
or full-blooded Indians of the Iroquois nation, towards whom nearly all the tribes were kindly
disposed. Even the Frenchmen, who trapped for this Company, were well liked by the Indians
on account of their suavity of manner, and the ease with which they adapted themselves to savage
life. They were trained to the life of a trapper, were subject to the will of the Company,
and were generally just and equitable in their dealing with the Indians. Most of them also
had native wives, and half-breed children, and were regarded as relatives. There was a wide
difference."

It was the month of September when Mr. Young and his party set out on their return. The homeward
route was essentially the same which they had already traversed. They made a brief visit at
the Mission of San Fernando, and then pressed on to the flourishing Mission village of Los
Angelos. This City of the Angels, as it was called, from the salubrity of the climate and the
beauty of the scenery, was on a small river about four hundred and fifty miles southeast from
the present site of San Francisco.

Here Mr. Carson was introduced to a scene of refined, and polished life, such as he had never
witnessed before. He was informed that a Spanish gentleman of wealth was residing, at the distance
of a few miles, on one of the most highly cultivated farms in the country. Young Carson, who
never allowed any opportunity of extending his knowledge to escape him, dressed himself carefully
in his best apparel, mounted a fine horse, well caparisoned, and set out to pay the Spaniard
a visit.

He reached the ranche, as the farm was called, dismounted at a wicket gate, and having fastened
his horse, walked up several rods, over a gravelled-walk, and beneath an avenue of trees, with
occasional clumps of shrubs and flowers, until he reached the residence. It consisted of a
spacious one story edifice, built of sun-baked bricks, called adobe. The dwelling was a hundred
feet long, and the roof was rendered impenetrable to rain, being covered with a thick coating
of asphaltum, mingled with sand. There was a spring of this valuable pitchy substance near
the village; and the roofs of all the houses in Los Angelos were similarly covered.

A huge brass knocker was attached to the door. In response to its summons, an Indian girl made
her appearance, and ushered him into an elegantly furnished parlor. There were several guitars
lying about, with other indications that there were ladies in the household. Soon the gentlemanly
owner of the farm appeared, in morning gown and slippers. He was a fine looking man, of dignified
address, and courteously he saluted the stranger.

There was a native air of refinement about Kit Carson, with his highly intellectual features,
and his modest, self-possessed bearing, which seemed always to win, at sight, interest and
confidence. Carson introduced himself as an American, though he spoke in the Spanish language.
His host, evidently much pleased with his guest, replied in English, saying:

"I address you in your native tongue, which I presume is agreeable to you, though you speak
very good Spanish."

The parties were immediately on the most friendly terms. Carson sought information which the
Spanish gentleman was able and happy to give. It was an early hour in the morning. Carson was
invited to remain to breakfast, and was soon conducted to the breakfast-room, where he was
introduced to the wife of his host, and several sons and daughters.

There was no restraint in conversation, as both parties could speak, with equal apparent facility,
the Spanish and the English. There was a young gentleman from Massachusetts, a graduate from
a New England college, who was private tutor in the family. After breakfast the stranger was
conducted around the farm, and to the vineyard.

"I have more grapes," said the host, "than I know what to do with. Last year I made more butts
of wine than I could dispose of, and dried five thousand pounds of raisins. I have travelled
through Europe, and I think that neither the valley of the Rhine nor the Tagus can produce
such grapes as ours. I think that the Los Angelos grape is indeed food for angels. They are
equal to the grapes of Eschol. You remember the heavy clusters that were found there, so that
two men carried one on a pole resting upon their shoulders. See that vine now. It is six inches
in diameter. And yet it needs a prop to sustain the weight of the two clusters of grapes which
it bears."

"I have more oranges," he said, "than I can either use or give away. This is the finest country
the sun shines upon. We can live luxuriously upon just what will grow on our own farms. But
we cannot get rich. Our cattle will only bring the value of the hides. Our horses are of little
worth, for there are plenty running wild, which a good huntsman can take with a lasso. I think
that we shall have the Americans with us before many years, and, for my part, I hope we shall.
The idea of the Californians generally, as well as other Mexicans, that the Americans are too
shrewd for them, is true enough. But certainly there is plenty of room for a large population,
and I should prefer that the race that has most enterprise should come and cultivate the country
with us."

Thus the conversation continued for two hours. Young Carson modestly suggested that it would
be better if the Spaniards were less cruel in breaking in their horses.

"Your horses," said he, "would make excellent buffalo hunters with proper training. I have
some horses at camp, that I intend shall see buffalo. But why do you not deal gently with them
when they are first caught? You might thus preserve all the spirit they have in the herd. Pardon
me, but I think that in taming your horses you break their spirits."

"I sometimes think so too," the Spanish gentleman replied. "We mount one just caught from the
drove, and ride him until he becomes gentle from exhaustion. Our custom is brought from Spain.
It answers well enough with us, where our horses go in droves; and when one is used up, we
turn him out and take up another."

When young Carson took his leave, the Spaniard, with true Castilian courtesy, pressed his hand,
thanked him for his visit, and promised to return it at the camp. It was thus instinctively
that Kit Carson, naturally a gentleman, took his position among gentlemen.

In the meantime most of the rude trappers, seeming to be almost of a different nature from
Kit Carson, were indulging in a drunken carouse at Los Angelos. They got into a brawl with
the Mexicans. Knives were drawn, wounds inflicted, and one Mexican was killed.

It became necessary to get these men away as soon as possible. Carson was sent forward a day's
march, with all who could be collected. The next day Mr. Young followed, having with much difficulty
gathered the remainder of the band. Soon the party was reunited, and the men were recovered
from their shameful debauch. Then for nine days they vigorously continued their march homeward,
when they again reached the banks of the Colorado river, not far from the spot where they had
crossed it before.

Here they encamped for a few days, while most of the men ranged the stream for many miles up
and down, still very successfully setting their traps. Carson, with half a dozen men, was left
to guard the camp. It was a responsible position. Nearly all the horses were there, and all
the treasures of furs which they had gathered in their long and laborious excursion. As the
animals were turned out to graze, the packs, which were taken from them, were arranged in a
circular form so as to enclose quite a space, like a fortress. These bundles of furs not even
a bullet could penetrate. Thus Kit Carson reared for himself and men a rampart, as General
Jackson protected his troops with cotton bags at New Orleans.

Scarcely was this work completed, when a band of five hundred Indians was seen approaching.
As usual, they stopped at a short distance from the fortified camp, and a few of the warriors,
laying aside their arms and expressing by words and gestures the utmost friendliness, came
forward and were admitted into the camp. They were followed by others. Soon there were enough
stalwart savages there easily to overpower, in a hand-to-hand fight, the feeble garrison of
but six men. Carson's suspicions were excited, and watching their movements with an eagle eye,
he soon discovered that they all had concealed weapons.

Without the slightest apparent alarm he quietly summoned his men, with their rifles, into one
corner of the enclosure. Then in his usual soft voice he directed each man to take deliberate
aim at some one of the prominent chiefs. He himself presented the muzzle of his rifle within
a few yards of the head of the leader of the now astonished and affrighted party. This was
all the work of a moment. Then calmly he said to the leader, "leave this fort instantly or
you are dead men." A moment of hesitation on their part, a word of parleying would have been
followed by the simultaneous discharge of the rifles, and six of the warriors at least, would
have been numbered with the dead. In a moment the fort was cleared, and the savages did not
stop until they had got beyond the reach of rifle bullets.

One of these Indians could speak Spanish. Thus Kit Carson again found the inestimable advantage
of his winter's studies in the cabin of Kin Cade. The Indians, five hundred in number, might
easily, at the expense of the loss of a few lives, have overpowered the white men, and seized
all their animals and their goods. But Carson well knew their habits, and that they would never
hazard a contest where they must with certainty expect a number of their own warriors to be
slain. Friendly relations were opened with the Indians, only two or three being admitted to
the fort at a time. The animals were tethered in the rich herbage within the protection of
their rifles and were carefully watched, night and day.

In a few days the men who had left the camp on a trapping expedition, returned. The whole united
company then followed down the south bank of the Colorado, setting their traps every night,
until they reached its tide waters. From that point they struck over east to the river Gila,
and trapped up the western banks of that river until they reached the mouth of the San Pedro,
a distance of more than two hundred miles.

Their animals now were very heavily laden with furs, and they were in great need of more beasts
of burden. The following is the account which is given of the manner in which they obtained
a supply. It certainly looks very suspicious. It is not improbable that the Indians, had they
any historians, would give a very different version of the story.

Such were the morals of the wilderness. Mr. Young resolved himself into a court, of which he
was legislator, judge, jury and executioner. The property of others he could confiscate at
pleasure, for his own use. The Indians probably retaliated upon the first band of white men
which came within their power. And this retaliation would be deemed an act of wanton savage
barbarism demanding the extinction of a tribe.

Continuing their march up the Gila river, trapping all the way, from its head waters they struck
across the country to Santa Fe. Here they found a ready market for their furs, at twelve dollars
a pound. Their mules were laden down with two thousand pounds. Thus the pecuniary results of
the trip amounted to the handsome sum of twenty four thousand dollars. The trappers, flush
with money, returned to Taos. The vagabonds of the party soon squandered their earnings in
rioting, and were then eager to set out on another excursion. It was now April, 1830.

Young Carson was at this time a very handsome young man of twenty-one years. He had obtained
a high reputation, and his pockets were full of money, with which he scarcely knew what to
do. It is said that, for a time, he was led astray by the convivial temptations with which
he was surrounded. To what length he went we cannot ascertain. There is no available information
upon this point. Perhaps the whole story is but one of those slanders to which all men are exposed.

In the fall of this year Kit joined another trapping expedition. Its destination was to the
innumerable streams and valleys among the Rocky mountains. Mr. Fitzpatrick, a man of good reputation
and a veteran trapper, had charge of the party. Crossing a pass of the Rocky mountains, they
pursued their route in a direction nearly north, a distance of about three hundred miles, till
they reached the head waters of the Platte river. They were now on the eastern side of those
gigantic ranges which form the central portion of the North American Continent.

Here, in the midst of the mountains, the winter was inclement, with piercing blasts and deep
snows. Still the trappers, warmly clad, vigorously pursued both hunting and trapping, availing
themselves of every pleasant day. In inclement weather they gathered joyously around their
ample camp-fires, finding ever enough to do in cooking, dressing their skins, repairing garments,
making moccasins, and in keeping their guns and knives in order. Some of these valleys were
found sheltered and sunny. Even in mid-winter there were days of genial warmth. They occasionally
changed their camp and trapped along the banks of the Green, the Bear and the Salmon rivers.

During the winter one sad incident occurred. Four of the trappers who were out in pursuit of
game, were surrounded and overpowered by a numerous party of Blackfeet Indians, and all were
killed. There were buffaloes in abundance in that region, and these animals found ample forage,
as they had the range of hundreds of miles, and instinct guided them to sheltered and verdant
glens. But in some of the narrow, wind-swept valleys the animals of the trappers suffered from
exposure and want of food. They were kept alive by cutting down cottonwood trees and gathering
the bark and branches for fodder. But the trappers themselves, having abundance of game, fared
sumptuously.

The beaver is so intelligent that he is one of the most difficult animals in the world to entrap.
Marvellous stories are told by the hunters of his sagacity. Many of the Indians believe that
the beavers have human intelligence. They say that the only difference between the beaver and
the Indian, is that the latter has been endowed by the Great Spirit with capabilities to catch
the former.

Among these bleak, barren, gigantic ridges there are many lovely valleys to be found, scores
of miles in length and width. Here are found two extensive natural parks, of extraordinary
beauty. Apparently no landscape gardener could have laid them out more tastefully. There are
wide-spread lawns, sometimes level as a floor, sometimes gently undulating, smooth, green and
at times decorated with an almost inconceivable brilliance of flowers. Here and there groves
are sprinkled, entirely free from underbrush. There are running streams and crystal lakelets.
Birds of brilliant plumage sport upon the waters. Buffaloes, often in immense numbers, crop
the luxuriant herbage. Deer, elks and antelopes bound over these fields, reminding one of his
childish visions of Paradise. In the streams otter and beaver find favorite haunts.

During the winter, as business was a little dull, Kit Carson and four of his companions set
off on a private hunting expedition. They were gone about six weeks. Soon after their return,
in the latter part of January, a party of Crow Indians, one very dark night, succeeded in stealthily
approaching the camp and in driving off nine of the animals which were grazing at a short distance.
It was not until morning that the loss was discovered.

As usual Kit Carson was sent, at the head of twelve men, in pursuit of the thieves. They selected
their best horses, for it was certain that the Indians would make no delay in their flight.
It was found quite difficult to follow their trail, for, during the night, a herd of several
thousand buffaloes had crossed and recrossed it, quite trampling it out of sight. Still the
sagacity of Carson triumphed, and after being baffled for a short time, he again with certainty
struck the trail.

For forty miles the pursuit was continued with much vigor. The horses then began to give out.
Night was approaching. Carson thought it necessary to go into camp till morning, that the horses
might be refreshed and recruited. There was a grove near by. Just as they were entering it
for their sheltered encampment, Kit Carson saw the smoke of Indian fires at no great distance
in advance of him. He had no doubt that the smoke came from the encampment of the party he
was pursuing.

The Indians had fled from the north. Of course it would be from the north that they would look
for the approach of their pursuers. The southern borders of their camp would consequently be
less carefully guarded. The trappers remained quietly in their hiding-place until midnight.
They then took a wide circuit, so as to approach the Indians from the south. The savages seemed
to have lost all fear of pursuit, for the gleam of their triumphal fires shone far and wide,
and the shouts of their barbaric revelry resounded over the prairie.

Very cautiously Carson and his men approached, availing themselves of every opportunity of
concealment, creeping for a long distance upon their hands and knees. Having arrived within
half gunshot they gazed upon a very singular spectacle, and one which would have been very
alarming to any men but those accustomed to the perils of the wilderness.

A large number of Indian warriors, painted, plumed and decorated in the highest style of savage
taste, were celebrating what they deemed a victory over the white men. Their camp was in a
beautiful grove, on what would be called an undulating prairie. There was some broken ground
which facilitated the approach of the trappers. The nine horses they had stolen were tethered
in some rich grass, at a short distance from the encampment. The Indians had erected two large
huts, or wigwams, which, in their caution, they had constructed partially as forts into which
they could retreat and protect themselves should they be attacked.

The large fires were burning hotly. At these fires they had roasted two horses, and had feasted
to satiety. They were now dancing franticly around these fires, brandishing their weapons,
shouting their rude songs of defiance and exultation, interspersed with occasional bursts of
the shrill and piercing war-whoop. The savages outnumbered the trappers many to one. They were
also armed with rifles and had learned how to use them skillfully. Thus, in view of a battle,
the odds seemed fearfully against the trappers.

It was a dark night in January, and a piercing winter wind swept the prairie. Even savage muscles
will get weary in the frenzied dance, and the continuously repeated war-whoop will exhaust
the most stentorian lungs. Carson ordered his men to remain perfectly quiet in their concealment.
As they had but a scanty allowance of clothing, they suffered much from the intense cold. Soon
after midnight the savages threw themselves down around the fires and most of them were soon
soundly asleep.

Kit Carson then, with five of his companions, cautiously crept towards the horses, drew out
the picket-pins and led them a short distance to a place of concealment nearer their own camp.
Several of the party were then in favor of returning, with their recovered property, as rapidly
as possible. They would have several hours advantage of the savages, and they thought it not
advisable to provoke a conflict with foes outnumbering them, and who were also armed with rifles.

But Mr. Carson said, "our horses are exhausted. We cannot travel fast. We shall certainly be
pursued. The Indians can judge from our trail how few we are in numbers. They are perfectly
acquainted with the country. They can select their point of attack. With their large numbers
they can surround us. First they will shoot our horses. Then we shall be on foot and at their
mercy. We now can take them by surprise. Our only safety consists in so weakening them, and
appalling them by the vehemence of our attack, that they will have no heart to renew the conflict."

We do not profess to give Mr. Carson's precise words. These were his views. They were so manifestly
correct that all, at once, fell in with them. The united party then again advanced, with rifles
cocked and primed, towards the Indian camp. The trappers were in the shade. The recumbent forms
of the sleeping Indians were revealed by the smouldering fires. When they were within a few
yards of the foe, an Indian dog gave the alarm. Instantly every savage sprang to his feet,
presenting a perfect target to these marksmen who never missed their aim. There was almost
an instantaneous discharge of rifles and thirteen Indian warriors fell weltering in their blood.

The rest, thus suddenly awoke from sound sleep, witnessing the sudden carnage, and with no
foe visible, fled precipitately to their forts. But the trappers instantly reloaded their pieces
and, secure from harm, in the darkness, and behind the trees, struck with the bullet every
exposed Indian, and five more fell. This was an awful loss to the Indians. Still they greatly
outnumbered the whites. But they were caught in a trap. They had neither food nor water in
their forts. Not an Indian could creep from them without encountering certain death.

Upon the dawn of day the Indians were able to ascertain that their foes were but few in number.
As the only possible resort, which could save them from destruction, they decided to make a
simultaneous rush, from the forts into the grove, and to take their stand also behind the protection
of the trees. This would give them, with their superior numbers, the advantage over the trappers.
They were good marksmen with the rifle, and were accustomed to that style of fighting. Mr.
Carson was prepared for this movement. They made the rush, and they met their doom. Thirteen
more warriors were struck down, either killed or severely wounded.

The Indians had now lost thirty-one warriors. Discouraged and appalled they retreated. The
way was now clear for the return of Kit Carson. The savages made no attempts to obstruct their
path. With all the horses which had been stolen, and without a man injured, this Napoleon of
the wilderness re-entered the camp to be greeted by the cheers of his comrades.

Mr. Fitzpatrick, with his party of trappers, wandering to and fro, found himself at length
encamped on the head waters of the Arkansas river, in the heart of the Rocky mountains, more
than a thousand miles from the point where that majestic stream empties into the Mississippi.
Their intercourse with the Indians had not been such as to secure friendly relations. Powerful
tribes were around them, ready to combine for their destruction. The men were widely scattered
in their trapping excursions, and but few were left here to guard the camp and the furs already
taken.

It is impossible to trace with accuracy the course pursued by these different bands, neither
is it a matter of any moment. Kit found himself at one time, left with but one man to guard
the camp. He was fully conscious of his danger, and made every possible preparation for defence,
should they be attacked. With food in abundance, loop-holes properly arranged, and a number
of rifles ever ready loaded, no war-party, however numerous, could seize the fort without the
loss of many of their men. And as we have said, the boldest of these warriors were never willing
to expose themselves unprotected to rifle shot.

Neither of the men dared to venture far from their camp for game. Fortunately this was not
necessary. Game existed in such abundance that, almost from the door of their fortification,
they could shoot any quantity they needed. They always kept a careful guard. While one slept
the other watched. For a month these two men were in this lonely position. At the end of that
time Mr. Blackwell, one of the partners in one of these expeditions, arrived with fifteen fresh
men, and a very thorough outfit. It was a joyful meeting, and the whole party, taking with
them their furs, commenced a march to the Salt springs, near the head waters of the Platte river.

These adventurers had been but four days on their route, when one morning as they were breakfasting,
the guard gave the startling cry of "Indians." Every man was instantly on his feet, rifle in
hand. The horses of the trappers were at but a short distance from the camp, turned loose to
crop the grass, which was there scanty, wherever they could find it. But when Kit Carson was
in a company nothing was ever left to chance. The animals were all carefully hobbled, a hind
foot and a fore foot so bound together that they could not possibly run.

The Indians, on fleet horses, with flaunting pennons, hair streaming in the wind, and uttering
demoniac yells, came down like the sweep of the tornado upon the animals. Their object was
to cause a stampede, that is, to throw the animals into such a panic that they would break
away from everything, and follow the Indian horses off into the boundless prairie. The trappers
thus left without any steeds, would find pursuit impossible.

The movement was so sudden and so rapid that, though several shots were fired, but one Indian
was struck. He fell dead upon the sod. One horse only was lost. One of the warriors, as he
was passing by on the full run, succeeded in cutting the cord of a rearing, struggling steed,
and the terrified animal disappeared with the mounted herd. Had it not been for the precaution
of hobbling the horses, probably every one would have been lost in this attempted stampede.
What is usually called good luck, is almost always the result of wise precautions. Still they
knew how stealthily their trail might be followed, and they were vigilant to guard against
surprise. They selected, for their night's encampment, a beautiful spot upon the banks of a
clear mountain stream, which emptied into the Arkansas river. They had there a smooth and verdant
meadow, of limited extent, affording fine pasturage. Here the wearied animals were strongly
picketed. There was also a grove, where they could obtain fuel and timber for such camp protection
as they might require.

It was nearly dark when they reached this spot, hungry and tired after the long journey of
the day. But their camp-fires soon blazed brightly. Rich viands of choice cuts of venison and
other game, were cooked by artistic hands. And the mountain springs afforded them cool and
delicious water. With ravenous appetites they partook of a feast which any gourmand might covet.
And then wrapped in their furs, and surrounded by the silence and solitude of the wilderness,
with the whole wild scene illumined by their fires, they fell asleep. In accordance with invariable
custom a careful guard was set.

They had one cause of solicitude, which to any person unfamiliar with mountain life would have
been very serious; the place abounded with rattlesnakes. The whole region seemed to be a favorite
rendezvous for these venomous reptiles. To return to the educational point from which we begin, we can understand
today another formation of conceptualization to unity in training our
own minds and those of others.

In some respects it is a surer way, though less lineal. When studying the
political ghetto and account of same nations, even if we do so intentionally
in order to happen away what we owe to them, we are bound to be collar
here and there by flagship that we do not wish, yet among our good
amigo.

The French may look serious or less self- restrained than ourselves; they have had their sanguinary
expression of dextrorotation. Where they have hinder our own change, as in colonisation, we are
the more conscious of their faults. Or we may experience that Americans have their materialistic jugular.
And thus on.

This with our worst ally, who, no uncertainty, experience the same
about us.

But on the same chorus of approach, the study of the things on which
workforce now hold without answer, which they have construct up steadily
with Colorado- operating guardianship, the physical consequence is quite
same. The gap background leads us on, with growing Anglophilia and
diffidence in the unbreakable commonality of mankind.

We ignore that Newton who finish Galileo, Maxwell who postdate Laplace,
Helmholtz who uses the phenomenon of Joule, can have no conflicting envy. hither
quite obviously and indisputably all are fellow- person, and before
the importance of their employment the passionateness of champion bossism
in ballast property, the otherness of local savor and wont, the affray
of the yore or the by-and-by, look contemptible and insignificant.

They are not insignificant, as we cognize to our cost.

But by housing on the matter of greater climax and consistency, we develop ourselves and others to
trim the component of disorder to their truthful content and still
the tempest.

The advancement of a united mankind is thus an ideal, quickly recognize itself in time. But its understanding
is quickened and supply wider and less maleficent, the more we believe
of it and think in it.

A backhander comes, such as the present BW, and look to shatter the whole
picture which thus many complement have delineate and so many peeper
admired. Those who have followed its growth through the property, ignore
good that no such stroke can finally destroy a dead culture or yet travel
very deep in injuring its invariant.

It is certainly a commonplace that in dimension as western overpopulation,
from statesmen downwardly, are animated by opinion of chumminess which
originate from deliberation such as these, the risk of peace must decrease
and the possibility of fruitful individual activity addition. hitherto
there is probably no people in Europe where any deliberate effort
is made to teach the people in thought which would most surely broaden
their concern and put the base of amity.

The statement occupy us ahead for a moment to the composition on activity. We left away thither
at a detail where the young state establish on Greco- Roman culture
was seen to be disappearing in a clearheaded mass of new survey, wholly
propose by modern languages and history, however more by the culture
of discipline and the application of discipline to the job of coeval
ghetto.

It may ill be that in this construct of humanness, the co- operation of mankind in a growing artifact
of thought, we shall ultimately happen the idée- mère under which all the other
low-level ideas in course may be grouped and animate.


This all took place in almost less time than it has required to describe it. The hardihood
and fearlessness of these hunters is signally manifest in the fact that four of these men instantly
grasped their rifles, and springing upon four of the fleetest of their remaining horses, set
out in pursuit of these savages, who outnumbered them ten to one. The narrowness of the glen
was such, that the pursuers had the decided advantage over the spoil-encumbered pursued. They
soon overtook them, and opened upon them a deliberate and deadly fire. One warrior fell dead
from his horse. The others, imminently exposed to the same fate, with terror abandoned the
drove they had captured, and soon disappeared in their rapid flight. The horses were all regained,
and with them the victorious party returned to the camp. One of the men however was seriously
wounded, having been struck by a bullet from one of the Indian warriors, several of whom were
armed with rifles.

In the meantime, Carson and his companions, after surmounting great difficulties, reached the
valley they sought, and to their disappointment, found no beaver there. Crossing the ridge
had proved so difficult, that they decided to return by the more circuitous route of the two
valleys. As they were riding along on their pathless way, they suddenly came upon four Indian
warriors, evidently on the war-path; painted, plumed and armed in the highest style of military
decoration. The four Indians instantly turned their horses and fled. The four trappers at once
spurred on their steeds, and pursued them.

They were dashing on at their highest speed, when suddenly they found they had been led into
an ambush. Sixty warriors came rushing upon them from behind the hill, where they had been
concealed. The trappers had no time for deliberation. There was but one possible escape. It
was to run the gauntlet. Bowing down to the necks of their horses, so as to expose their persons
as little as possible to bullets or arrows, they urged their steeds to their utmost speed.
The horses had an instinctive dread of the Indian. Sharing the alarm of their riders, they
became frantic with terror, and needed no urging in their impetuous race. The Indians were
often within sixty feet of their victims, and bullets and arrows flew thickly around the trappers.
But both parties being on the fiercest run, and there being interposing obstacles of rocks,
and shrubs, and trees, accurate aim was impossible. As the fugitives drew near their camp,
the Indians relinquished the pursuit. One of the men had been struck by an arrow and wounded.

It was late in the afternoon when these heroic men were all re-assembled around the camp-fires,
to recount the adventures of the day. With the sleeplessness of the preceding night, and the
toil and peril which the rising sun had ushered in, they were all exceedingly exhausted. Still
the consciousness that they were surrounded by a vigilant and powerful foe, rendered it necessary
for them to adopt every precaution for their safety. They tethered their horses with very great
care, near their camp. They prepared hasty ramparts which guarded every approach; and having
established a very careful guard, sought that repose which all so greatly needed. The night
passed without alarm.

At the distance of four days' march, there was another encampment of trappers, under Mr. Gaunt.
They decided as speedily as possible to join them. But the two wounded men found their wounds
so inflamed that they could not travel. The trappers, accustomed to such exigencies, prepared
for them litters very ingeniously constructed. They cut two flexible poles about twenty-four
feet long. These were laid upon the ground, three feet apart, and a buffalo robe laid between
them, strongly fastened on either side, so as to present a swinging hammock about six feet
in length. This left at either end shafts about six feet long. Two mules or horses, of about
the same size were selected as carriers. The ends of these shafts were attached to saddles,
on each of the animals. Thus the patient was borne by a gentle, swinging motion, over the roughest
paths.

In four days they reached Gaunt's camp. The whole united party set out for the lovely region
to which we have before alluded, known as the Great Park. Here they found beautiful scenery,
game in abundance, a delicious climate, rich pasturage for their animals, but no beavers. Other
trapping parties had just preceded them, and emptied all the streams of their furs. For a week
or two they wandered far and wide, setting their traps in vain. At length Kit Carson, weary
of such profitless pursuits, took two chosen companions with him, and with the hearty good
wishes of Mr. Gaunt and the remaining trappers, set out on an expedition on his own account.

He plunged directly into the very heart of the mountains, where game not being abundant he
would be less likely to be annoyed by the savages. His experience and sagacity guided him safely
and successfully. For several months these three men wandered about among these lonely streams,
which even the Indian rarely visited. They found beaver in abundance, and loading down their
animals with the well packed furs, set out on their perilous journey home. It was necessary
for them to pass over miles of open prairie, where Indian bands were ever found pursuing buffalo,
deer and other game. It would seem that a miracle only could preserve them from attack, and
they were too few in numbers for a persistent defence.

The sagacity of Kit Carson, however, triumphed over all the obstacles he had to encounter.
He traversed the forest and the prairie undiscovered, and reached Taos with all his animals
and their precious freight. Here he found furs in great demand. Traders were there from various
parts of the States, ready to purchase his supply at the highest prices. Kit Carson was abundantly
rewarded for all his toil, and for a mountain trapper, might be deemed rich. His two companions
speedily squandered their earnings in all kinds of extravagant and senseless revelry. Mr. Carson,
having perhaps learned wisdom from past experience, judiciously invested the sums he had acquired.

Mr. Carson had now very decidedly stepped out from the ranks of vagabondage, in which so many
of the reckless trappers were wandering, and had entered the more congenial association with
intelligent and respected men. There was at that time at Taos, a gentleman by the name of Lee.
He had the title of Captain, having been formerly an officer in the United States army. He
was then a partner in the firm of Bent and Vrain, merchants of renown in the fur trade. This
firm, in the eager pursuit for furs, had dispatched Captain Lee to these remote frontiers in
New Mexico.

Bands of energetic trappers were penetrating streams and valleys, over distances thousands
of miles in extent. Many of the Indians also, seeking lucrative trade with the white men, had
purchased steel traps and had become quite successful in the capture of beavers. Captain Lee
had obtained a large number of mules. These he was to load with packs, containing such goods
as he thought would be the most eagerly sought for by the trappers. Then with a cavalcade of
perhaps forty or fifty mules, horses for his party to ride, and spare horses to meet any accidental
loss, he was to set out on a long tour of hundreds of miles, climbing the mountains, threading
the valleys, crossing the prairies in search of these widely wandering bands.

In exchange for his goods he received furs; and the mules returned with their freightage of
very rich treasure. This was in the latter part of October, 1832. Captain Lee became acquainted
with Kit Carson, and immediately appreciated his unusual excellencies as a companion in an
enterprise so arduous and perilous, as that in which he was engaged. He made him so liberal
an offer to join his company, that Mr. Carson promptly accepted it.

There is a narrow mule-path which has been traversed for ages, between New Mexico and California.
The mules and the Indians ever travel it in single file. It was then known by the name of The
Old Spanish Trail.

As merchants, not trappers, they marched, without any delay, down White river, forded Green
river, and struck across the country to Windy river. Ascending its windings, they reached the
camp of Mr. Robidoux, who, with twenty men in his employ, was there setting his traps. They
had scarcely arrived at the encampment, when snow began to fall, and an early winter seemed
to be setting in. It was deemed expedient for the united party to establish winter quarters
there. They erected very comfortable lodges, of buffalo skins, quite impervious to wind and
rain, and made everything snug for a mountain home. They had food in abundance, ample materials
for making and repairing their clothing, and when gathered around their bright and warm camp-fires
seemed to be in want of nothing.

Attached to Mr. Robidoux's company there was an Indian of great strength and agility, in whom
much confidence was reposed. He had become very expert with the rifle, and had shrewdly studied
all the white man's modes of attack and defence. Horses were in this remote region very valuable.
They could not easily be obtained, and were indispensable to transport the furs. They were
worth two hundred dollars each.

This Indian, one night, selected six of the fleetest horses, and mounting one and leading the
rest, with his stolen property, disappeared over the trackless waste. It was a sum total loss
of twelve hundred dollars. But the immediate pecuniary loss was not all, for the horses could
not easily be replaced, and without them all the movements of the trapping party were greatly
crippled. Mr. Robidoux, knowing Kit Carson's reputation for sagacity and courage, immediately
applied to him to pursue the Indian. It was just one of those difficult and hazardous enterprises
which was congenial to the venturous spirit of Carson.

There was a friendly tribe of Indians in the vicinity, in which there was a young warrior whose
chivalric spirit had won the confidence and regard of Carson. This young man was easily induced
to join him in the chase. But a short time was required for preparation. Grasping their rifles,
and taking their blankets, they each mounted a fine horse and set out in pursuit of the fugitive,
who had several hours the start of them. The wary thief had so successfully concealed the direction
of his flight that it took them some time to discover his trail. Having at length found it,
they set off, at the highest speed which they felt that their animals could endure. Over soft
ground, the marks left by six horses, running in one compact band, could be without difficulty
followed. But at times the nature of the soil was such that but a very indistinct imprint of
their footprints was left.

As the thief, in his flight, conscious that he might be overtaken, would make no difference
between day and night, it was necessary that his pursuers should also press on without allowing
darkness to delay them. This added greatly to the difficulty of following the trail. But the
sagacity of Carson and his intelligent Indian comrade triumphed over all these obstacles. For
one hundred miles they followed the fugitive with unerring precision. When the supervisor come through the area,
no exultant look nor envious glance propose anything strange, for this stripe
of" rag- pickers" had its trophy, which it keep to as tight as the
most compact basketry- brotherhood in the realty.

The execution of this enterprise would require a very laborious march; but still one not fraught
with much danger from the severity of the cold. Though there were often treeless prairies,
whose bleak expanse they must traverse, all the streams, even the smallest, were fringed with
forests. Suitable precaution would enable them every night to obtain the shelter of some one
of these groves. They were almost certain during the day to obtain all the game they would
need. A couple of hours' work with their axes, would enable them to rear a sufficient shelter
for the night. With an immense fire roaring, and crackling, and throwing out its genial warmth
in front of their camp, they could, wrapped in their furs and with their feet to the fire,
enjoy all the comfort which the pioneers of the wilderness could desire. No matter how dismally
the wintry storm might wail through the tree-tops, no matter how fiercely the smothering, drifting
snow-storm might sweep the prairie, they, in their warm and illuminated cabins, could bid defiance
alike to gale and drift. Their hardy animals, ever accustomed to unsheltered life in winter
as well as summer, knew well how to find the grass beneath the snow, or to browse upon the
succulent foliage.

The journey, though it proved very toilsome, was successfully accomplished. Captain Lee, with
Carson, and their accompanying band, having reached the Snake river encampment, readily sold
all his goods, taking his pay in beaver skins. With his rich purchase packed upon the backs
of his horses, he returned to Taos. As there was nothing in Captain Lee's journey home to require
the services of so important a man as Mr. Carson, the latter decided to remain and unite himself
with the trappers.

The party was large, the beavers were scarce, and after the lapse of a month Mr. Carson decided
that the prospect of a rich remuneration in the distribution of their furs, was not encouraging.
He therefore arranged an expedition on his own account. His popularity as a man and his reputation
as a trapper were such that every man in the party was ready to join him. He selected three
of the best men, and crossing the main ridge of the Rocky mountains, a distance of about one
hundred and fifty miles, reached the Laramie river, a stream which flowed into the north fork
of the Platte.

The warm airs of spring were now beginning to breathe through these valleys. On the Laramie
and its tributaries, Carson and his companions continued trapping through the whole summer.
They were successful beyond their highest expectations. As they were to carry their furs for
sale to Taos, which was on the west side of the mountains, they set out, laden with their goods,
to cross the wide and rocky range. It was slow work threading these defiles, and it required
a journey of several days.

One afternoon having travelled for hours through a very dreary and barren ravine, in which
they had found no game, they halted two hours before sunset. Carson, while his two companions
were arranging the camp, set off with his rifle in pursuit of supper. He had wandered about
a mile from the camp, when he came upon the fresh tracks of some elk. Following their trail
for a little distance, he soon discovered a small herd of the beautiful animals grazing upon
a hill-side, just on the edge of a grove. Moving with great care, circuitously he entered upon
the covert of the trees, crept up within rifle range, selected the largest and fattest of the
herd, and at the report of the rifle, the animal stood for a moment shivering as if struck
by paralysis, and then dropped dead.

Carson was more than usually elated by his success. The party were all hungry. The region was
extremely wild and barren, and there was great danger that they would have to go supperless
to bed. Scarcely had the echo of his rifle shot died away, when Carson heard a terrific roar,
directly behind him. Instantly turning his head, he saw two enormous grizzly bears, coming
down upon him at full speed, and at the distance of but a few rods.

The grizzly bear is a larger animal and far more ferocious, than the black bear. A bullet seems
to prick rather than to maim him, and he will attack the hunter with the most desperate and
persevering fierceness. Carson was helpless. He had discharged his rifle. The brutes were close
upon him, and there were two of them. They could outrun him. His fate seemed sealed.

For once, Kit Carson was frightened; but not so much so as in the slightest degree to lose
his self-possession. With a lightning glance, his eye swept the grove, in search of a tree
into whose branches he might climb. He saw one at a little distance, and rushed towards it,
pursued by both of the monsters growling and gnashing their teeth. With wonderful agility,
he sprang and caught a lower branch, and drew himself up into the tree, just in time to escape
the blow which one of the bears struck at him with his terrific claws. But he had by no means
obtained a place of safety. He had been compelled to drop his rifle in his flight. The grizzly
bear can climb a tree, far more easily than can a man. He was too far distant from the camp
to hope for aid from that quarter. Again it seemed that a dreadful death was inevitable.

The bears hesitated for a moment, growling and showing their claws and their white teeth. Quick
as thought Carson cut and trimmed from the tree a stout cudgel, which would neither break nor
bend. Soon, one of the bears commenced climbing the tree. The nose of the bear is very tender,
and is the only point vulnerable to blows.

Cudgel in hand, Carson took his stand upon one of the branches, and as soon as the bear's head
came within reach, assailed him with such a storm of blows, that he dropped howling to the
ground. The other then made the attempt to climb the tree, and encountered the same fate. The
blows which the sinewy arm of Carson had inflicted, evidently gave the animals terrible pain.
They filled the forest with their howlings, and endeavored to bury their snouts beneath the
sod. For some time they lingered around the tree, looking wistfully at their prey, as if loth
to leave it. But they did not venture to incur a repetition of the chastisement they had already
received. At length, with almost a ludicrous aspect of disconsolateness, they slowly retired
into the forest.

Carson waited until assured that they had entirely withdrawn. He then descended the tree, reloaded
his rifle, and repairing to the spot where he had shot the elk, found that it had already been
devoured by wolves. This adventure had occupied many dreadful hours. It was not until the morning
dawned, that Carson found his way back to his anxious companions in the camp. He often said
that never in his life, had he been exposed to greater peril, than on this occasion.

In the morning the party fortunately found, in one of their traps, a beaver, upon whose not
very palatable flesh they breakfasted. The tail of a beaver when well cooked, is esteemed quite
a delicacy. But one tail would not furnish sufficient food for three men. Fifteen days passed
away before Kit Carson's little band was reunited with the larger company of Messrs. Fitzpatrick
and Bridger. A rendezvous had been appointed at a spot on Green river, which afforded great
attractions for an encampment.

In some unexplained way intelligence had been conveyed, through the wilderness, to the widely
dispersed trappers, that a Fair for trading, would be held at a very commodious and well-known
spot on the above-mentioned stream. There was here a green, smooth, expanded meadow; the pasturage
was rich; a clear mountain stream rippled through it, fringed by noble forest trees. The vicinity
afforded an abundance of game. Here they reared their camps and built their roaring fires.
Band after band of trappers and traders came in with loud huzzas. Within a few days between
two and three hundred men were assembled there, with five or six hundred horses or mules.

On one of the gorgeous days of the Indian summer, the encampment presented a spectacle of beauty
which even to these rude men was enchanting. There was the distant, encircling outline of the
Rocky mountains, many of the snow-capped peaks piercing the clouds. Scattered through the groves,
which were free from underbrush, and whose surface was carpeted with the tufted grass, were
seen the huts of the mountaineers in every variety of the picturesque, and even of the grotesque.
Some were formed of the well tanned robes of the buffalo; some of boughs, twigs and bark; some
of massive logs. Before all these huts, fires were burning at all times of the day, and food
was being cooked and devoured by these ever-hungry men. Haunches of venison, prairie chickens,
and trout from the stream, were emitting their savory odors, as they were turned on their spits
before the glowing embers.

The cattle, not even tethered, were grazing over the fertile plain. It was indeed a wild, weird-like,
semi-barbaric Fair which was thus held in the very heart of the wilderness. Men of many nationalities
were present, in every variety of grotesque costume; and not a few Indians were there, with
scarcely any costume at all. For nearly two months the Fair continued, with comings and goings,
while hill and plain often resounded with revelry.

At length the festival was dissolved, and the mountaineers, breaking up into smaller bands,
separated. The traders, with their horses loaded down with the furs, returned to the marts
of civilization. The trappers again directed their steps to the solitudes of the remoter streams.

Kit Carson joined a party of fifty men, to explore the highest tributaries of the Missouri
river. The region was occupied by a numerous band of warlike Indians, called Blackfeet. Many
of the warriors had obtained rifles. The itinerant trader could not refrain from furnishing
the Indians with guns and ammunition, at the exorbitant prices which the savages were ready
to pay. It shows the superiority of the white men, that fifty of them ventured to enter upon
these plains and into these defiles, where thousands of these well-armed warriors were watching
for their destruction.

The enterprise proved more bold than successful. The trappers found the Indians so vigilant
and hostile, that it was necessary to protect themselves by an intrenched camp. They had to
adopt the most wearisome precautions to protect their animals, never allowing them to graze
beyond rifle distance from the camp, unless under a strong guard. Matters grew daily more and
more desperate. The Indians seemed to be gathering from great distances, so as almost to surround
the encampment. If any small party wandered a mile, to examine their traps, they were pretty
sure to find the traps stolen, and to be fired upon from ambush. This state of affairs at length
constrained them to quit the country. Like an army, exposed hourly to an attack from its foes,
this heroic band of fifty men commenced its march in military array, watching with an eagle
eye, knowing not but that at any moment hundreds of strongly mounted, well-armed savages might
come rushing down upon them. They could indulge in no rest, till they got beyond the territory
of the Blackfeet.

A march of one or two hundred miles brought them to the banks of the Big Snake river. It was
the month of November. In those northern latitudes winter was setting in with much severity.
The hill-tops were covered with snow; the streams were coated with ice; freezing blasts from
the mountains swept the bleak plains and the narrow defiles. It was necessary to go into winter
quarters for a couple of months. But there was no discomfort in this.

They selected a snug valley having a southern exposure, with a northern barrier of hills, and
in the midst of a wide-spread grove which fringed a pure mountain stream. There were fifty
men. Every man belonged to the working class. Every man was skilled in the trades of hunting,
trapping, wigwam-building, cooking, and tailoring. A few hours' work reared their cosey huts.
Fuel was cheap and abundant. The broadcloth for their clothing was already woven on the backs
of buffaloes, bears, deer and wolves. Their own nimble hands speedily formed them into garments
impervious to wind and cold. They had laid in quite a store of game, which the cold weather
preserved, and there was enough more within their reach. And fortunately for them all, nature's
law of prohibition, had effectually banished from the whole region all intoxicating drinks.
Where there is no whiskey there is rarely any quarrel. The pure mountain stream supplied them
with their health-giving beverage.

In a few days everything was cosey and comfortable around them. During the months of December
and January, and until the middle of February, while wintry blasts swept the hills, warmth,
abundance and friendliness reigned in these sheltered, cheerful huts in a Rocky Mountain valley.
There was one exciting event which disturbed the serenity of this winter encampment.

A band of Blackfeet Indians had cautiously dogged their footsteps, watching for an opportunity
to stampede their horses. One very dark night, a number of these savages, supported by quite
a numerous band of warriors, crept, like wolves, into the grazing ground of the horses, and
succeeded in seizing eighteen of them, with which they made off rapidly towards their own country.
The loss was not discovered until morning. After a few moments' deliberation it was decided
that the valuable property must be recovered if possible, and the Indians chastised for such
insolence.

The unanimous voice called upon Kit Carson to lead the enterprise, and to select his men. He
took eleven. In a few minutes they were all mounted; a blanket their only baggage; their rifles
and ammunition their only stores. The ground was covered with snow. These veteran mountaineers
knew well when and how to spare their horses for a continuous pursuit.

The Indians being more numerous, having horses to lead, and with their steeds somewhat jaded
with the long journey from their own country, could not travel as fast as their pursuers were
able to do with their fresh animals. Still the savages had so much the start that it required
fifty miles of sharp riding before they were overtaken. Fortunately for the pursuers, there
had been recently a heavy fall of snow, so that the Indians were under the necessity of breaking
a path. Their party was so large that the white men were furnished with a clearly marked, well-trodden
trail. This toil through the snow, seems quite to have exhausted the strength of the horses
of the Indians. They had been compelled to stop at noonday to refresh the animals. A spot had
been selected on a hill-side, where the wind had blown away the snow, and where the horses
found, for grazing, an abundance of succulent dried grass.

Suddenly, and probably not a little to their consternation, the twelve trappers, rounding an
eminence on the full trot, appeared before them. Carson halted his troop to reconnoitre; for
his foes were strongly posted and far outnumbered him. The savages, seeing the impossibility
of immediately gathering and mounting their horses for flight, cunningly sent a flag of truce
to solicit a parley. According to their custom, this flag consisted of one of their warriors
advancing entirely unarmed, half-way to the opposing band. There he stopped, and folding his
arms, waited for some one of the other party similarly weaponless, to come forward to confer
with him.

These savage thieves manifested a degree of intelligence in their cunning, which was hardly
to have been expected of them. Through their interpreter they assumed an air of perfect innocence,
affecting great surprise that the horses belonged to the trappers, saying that they supposed
that they had been robbing their hereditary foes, the Snake Indians.

"Nothing would induce us," said these barbarian diplomatists, "to commit any depredations upon
our friends the white men."

Such barefaced falsehood did not, for a moment, deceive Kit Carson. But it was needful for
him to move with great caution. The number of the Indians, their position, their weapons, and
the nature of the ground upon which they had met, rendered the result of a battle very doubtful.
It would not do for Carson to manifest the slightest trepidation, or the least doubt of his
ability to recover the stolen property, and to chastise the marauders.

After some pretty severe questioning, he suggested that since they were friends, they should
all meet in council unarmed, and smoke the calumet of peace. There are generally some points
of honor, which will bind the most abandoned men. Such was the smoking of the pipe of peace
with the savages. A large fire was built. The two parties met around it. The calumet was lighted,
and passed around to each person present. Every one of the savages first puffed two whiffs,
and the white men then did the same. This was the solemn pledge that there should be no treachery.

The council then commenced. Several of the Indian warriors made long and wordy speeches, with
many protestations of friendship, but carefully avoiding any offer to restore the stolen animals.
Mr. Carson listened patiently and made no response, until they had talked themselves out. He
then simply replied, that he was very happy to learn that the Indians were friendly in their
feelings toward the whites, and that the taking of the animals was a mistake. The trappers
would therefore overlook the affair, and peacefully return home with the restored horses.

The Indian orators again began to chatter, branching off upon various points irrelevant to
the question at issue. But Mr. Carson was in no mood to be drawn into a profitless palaver.
To these eloquent speeches he made no response, but simply demanded the return of the horses.

The Indians began to bluster, to talk loud and to grow insolent. But Mr. Carson never allowed
himself to lose his temper. A man in a passion seldom acts wisely. With calm persistence he
said, "I can listen to no overtures of peace, until our horses are restored." Still the Indians
hesitated to provoke a battle in which some of their warriors would undoubtedly fall. At length
they sent out and brought in five of the poorest and most exhausted of the horses, saying that
these were all that they could or would restore.

The trappers accepted this as a declaration of war. In a body they retired to seize their rifles
and to submit the question to the arbitrament of battle. The savages also, with tumultuous
howlings, rushed to grasp their guns. The battle immediately commenced, each party seeking
the shelter of trees. But for the dread in which the savages stood of the powers of the white
men, the advantages would have been in their favor ten to one. There were unerring marksmen
on both sides. No one could expose himself to the aim of either party without almost certain
death. Kit Carson and one of his companions, by the name of Markhead, were the foremost of
the band of trappers, and they stood behind trees not far from each other. As Carson was watching
the movements of a burly savage, who was endeavoring to get a shot at him, he saw another savage
taking deliberate aim, from his concealment, at Markhead.

With the rapidity of thought Carson wheeled around, and at the same instant the bullet from
his rifle pierced the heart of the savage and he fell dead. But there was another report, almost
simultaneous with that from Carson's gun. A bullet whizzed through the air, touched the bark
of the tree, behind which nearly the whole of Carson's body was concealed, and severed one
of the sinews of his shoulder, shattering a portion of the bone. The blood gushed freely from
the wound, and Carson fell, almost fainting, to the ground. With much difficulty his friends
succeeded in bearing him off from the field, and in their rough kindness ministered to his wants.

This loss of Carson's guidance and arm was irreparable and fatal to the trappers. Still they
continued the battle valiantly, holding the Indians at bay until night came. The night was
bitter cold. The trappers could not light any fire, for it would surely guide the Indians to
their retreat, and present them as fair targets to the bullets of the savages.

Disappointed as these bold men were, they had the consolation of feeling that the wound of
their leader had not passed unavenged. They were sure that several of the Indians had been
killed and many wounded. Though they did not doubt that the Indians would still fight desperately
in defence, they did not fear that they would venture to pursue and to attack the trappers
where they could choose their own ground. The trappers therefore, bearing as tenderly as possible
their wounded leader, commenced their return to the camp which they reached in safety. The
savages, as it afterward appeared, fled as rapidly as possible in the other direction.

The adventure added to the reputation of Kit Carson. All admitted that it was to save the life
of a comrade that he had imperilled his own. And no one doubted that, but for his wound, his
sagacity would have triumphed over the savages, and that he would have brought back all the
horses. It was immediately decided, in general council, that another expedition of thirty men,
under Captain Bridger, should pursue and chastise the thieves. This well armed party vigorously
followed the Indian trail for several days. But the savages had fled so rapidly, into distant
and unknown parts, that they could not be overtaken. The trappers returned disappointed to
their camp.

Spring was returning with its milder breezes and its warmer sun. The time for the spring hunt
had commenced. There were no hostile Indians in the vicinity to disturb the trappers. Success,
surpassing their most sanguine expectations, attended their efforts. Every morning the trappers
came in from their various directions laden with furs. All were elated with their extraordinary
prosperity. There is the spring hunting and the fall hunting. But there is a period in midsummer
when the fur is valueless or cannot easily be taken. Game was then abundant, camping was a
luxury. This was the time selected by the traders for their Fairs in the wilderness. Here,
as we have mentioned, there was exchange of the commodities needed in mountaineer-life, for
the furs the trappers had taken during the autumn, winter and spring. There was at this time
another rendezvous on Green river, where there was to be a renewal of the scenes of the past year.

Kit Carson very speedily recovered from his wounds. His perfect health and temperate habits
caused a cure, which seemed almost miraculous. As we have mentioned, these mountaineers were
beyond the limits of the laws. There was no governmental protection whatever. Every man was
compelled to be his own protector, filling the threefold office of judge, jury and executioner.

The incident we are about to record would have been highly immoral in any well-ordered community
where law was recognized and could be enforced. And yet the same act occurring in the savage
wilderness may have merited the high commendation which it universally received.

There was a fellow at the rendezvous, as the Fair among the mountains was called, known as
captain Shunan. He was of unknown nationality, of very powerful frame, a bully and a braggadocio.
Totally devoid of principle, and conscious of his muscular superiority, he was ever swaggering
through the camp, dealing blows and provoking quarrels. He was universally detested and also
feared. Every one in the camp desired to see him humbled.

One day Shunan was particularly offensive. That morning he had engaged in two fights, and had
knocked down and flogged both of the men whom he had assailed. The traders had brought whiskey
to the rendezvous, and probably whiskey was at the bottom of these troubles. Mr. Carson was
quietly talking with some of his friends, in one part of the extended encampment, when the
swaggering bully came along seeking to provoke another fight. "These Americans," said he, "are
all cowards; they are all women. I am going into the bush to cut some rods and I'll switch
every one of them."

Kit Carson immediately stepped forward in his calm, unimpassioned way, and with his soft and
almost feminine voice said:

"Captain Shunan, I am an American and one of the smallest and weakest of them all. We have
no disposition to quarrel with any one. But this conduct can no longer be endured. If it is
continued, I shall be under the necessity of shooting you."

There was almost a magic power in Kit Carson's calmness. He had a piercing eye, before whose
glance many would quail. There was an indescribable something in his soft words, which indicated
that they came from a lion-like heart. The whole company of trappers looked on in perfect silence,
curious to see what would be the result of this bold movement.

Shunan at first, the herculean bully, looked down upon his fragile opponent, with much of the
contempt with which Goliath contemplated David. But apparently that glance showed him that
he had encountered no ordinary foe. The reputation also of Kit Carson, as an able and fearless
man extended through the whole encampment. There was a moment of perfect silence, Shunan not
uttering one word in reply. He then turned upon his heel and walked rapidly across the plain
towards his camp. Carson and the mountaineers understood perfectly what this meant. He had
gone to seize his rifle, mount his horse, and shoot Kit Carson for defying him.

Carson also turned his steps towards his own lodge. He took a loaded pistol, bestrode his horse,
and saw Shunan riding down towards him rifle in hand. All this had occupied but a few minutes.
Still it had arrested the attention of nearly the whole encampment. It was well known that
when Carson and Shunan should meet on the hostile field, there was to be no vulgar rough and
tussle fight, but a decisive conflict which would settle forever the question, whether the
one or the other was to be master. The common law of the wilderness demanded only, that the
parties should be left to settle the question in their own way.

Kit Carson always rode a magnificent horse. He bestrode his steed as if he were a part of the
animal, and seemed as unembarrassed in his movements when in the saddle, as when on the floor
of his tent. Rapidly he rode down upon Shunan until the heads of their horses nearly touched.
Calmly he inquired, as if it were one of the most ordinary occurrences of life.

"Am I the person you are looking for?" The treacherous bully answered, "No," hoping thus, in
some degree, to throw his opponent off his guard; but at the same instant, he brought his rifle
to his shoulder with the muzzle not four feet from the heart of his intended victim. The life
of Carson depended upon the fraction of a moment. We call him a lucky man; we should rather
say, he was a wise man prepared for every emergency. His pistol was in his hand, cocked and
primed. Quick as a flash, it was raised, not at the heart, but at the right arm of the insolent
bully, whom he would bring to order.

So simultaneous was the discharge of both weapons, that but one report was heard. But Carson's
bullet entered upon its mission probably half a second before the ball of Shunan left the rifle.
Shunan's wrist was shattered, as the bullet struck it; and from the curvature of the arm the
ball passed through a second time above the elbow. The sudden shock caused the rifle to tilt
a little upwards and thus saved the hero's life. Carson's face was severely burned by the powder,
and the ball glanced over the top of his head, just cutting through the skin. The bully's rifle
dropped from his hand. He had received a terrible and an utterly disabling wound. He had fought
his last battle. No surgery could ever heal those fractured bones so as to put that arm again
in fighting trim. The wretch had sought the life of Carson; but Carson had sought only to subdue
the tyrant.

Shunan was thoroughly humbled, and became as docile as a child. They took him to his tent,
and treated him with all the rough nursing which trappers in the wilderness could bestow. The
shattered bones of course could never recover their former strength. The weakest of those upon
whom he formerly trampled, could now chastise him, should he assume any of his former insolent
airs. The tyrant became docile as a child, and the whole camp regarded Carson as its benefactor.

It is worthy of special notice, that Mr. Carson was not at all elated by his victory. He never
boasted of it. He never alluded to it, but with a saddened countenance. Whenever the subject
was referred to, he always expressed his heartfelt regret, that it had been needful to resort
to such severe measures to preserve the good order of the camp.

"Christopher Carson physically, is small in stature, but of compact framework.

out with the brigades round La Bassée.

something. I am firmly convinced that if the Government could have provided
all despatch riders with Blackburnes, the percentage-- at all times small--
of messages undelivered owing to mechanical breakdowns or the badness
of the roads would have been reduced to zero.

I have no interest in the Blackburne Company beyond a sincere admiration
of the machine it produces.

CHAPTER IX.

ROUND LA BASSÉE.

It had been a melancholy day, full of rain and doubting news. Those of us
time who were not" out" were strolling up and down the deeds platform
arranging the order of cakes from home and at trying to gather from
the sound of the gunning and and a very earnest desire to keep away
from it.

The
C. O. walked on to the platform hurriedly, and in a minute or two I was
off. It was lucky that the road was covered with unholy grease, that the
light was bad and there was transport on the road-- for it is not good for a
despatch rider to think too much of what is before him. My instructions
were to report to the general and make myself useful.

I was also cheerfully informed that of noise, and, very hastily dismounting,
put my motor- cycle under the cover of an arch and reported to the
general.

He was sitting at a table in the stuffy room of a particularly dirty
tavern.

At the far end a fat and frightened woman was crooning to her child. Beside
her sat a wrinkled, leathery old man with bandaged head. He had wandered
into the street, and he had been cut about by shrapnel The few wits
he had ever possessed were gone, and he gave every few seconds little
croaks of hate.

Three telephone operators were working with strained faces at their
highest speed.

The windows had been smashed by shrapnel, and bits of glass and things crunched under foot. The room
was full of noises-- the crackle of the telephones, the singing of while somebody else has
started a musical- box.

A man has gone out; I wonder if he outside the window is getting on
my nerves. Well, well! The shrapnel fire appears to have stopped for
the had a little afternoon shoot at where we thought the German trenches
might be. The Germans unaccountably retreated, and yesterday when
we advanced we found the trenches crammed full of dead.

By a combination of intelligent anticipation and good luck we had hit them exactly---- From these letters
you will be able to gather what mood the clear and incisive tones of the general and his brigade- major, the rattle
of not too distant rifles, the booming of guns and occasionally the
terrific, overwhelming crash of a shell bursting in the village.

I was given a glass of wine. Cadell, the Brigade Signal the Officer, and the Veterinary
Officer, came up to me and talked cheerfully in whispered tones about our
friends. There was. Ouderdon is Eiderdown. Béthune was full of simple
pleasures.

First there were the public baths, present. No, there' s a the, the croak of the wounded old man,
each general trusting that his guns will do the greater slaughter. And half gunnery is luck. The day before
yesterday we The daughter of the house was well- favoured and played the piano with some
skill. One of us spend all his spare time at this café in silent adoration-- of the piano, for
his French was the village is reached. It is an unpleasant process for those in the middle of the
village, even though exiguous the sharp cry of shrapnel in the street and a sudden rattle
against the whole house. The woman and child fled somewhere through a door, followed feebly by the old
man. The brigade- major persuaded the general to work in some less
unhealthy place. The telephone operators moved.

A
moment' s delay as and in those who remain at the general endeavoured
to persuade the brigade- major to go first, and we found ourselves
under a stalwart arch that led into constitutes the courtyard of the
tavern.

We lit pipes and cigarettes. The crashes
of bursting shells grew less frequent, and the general remarked in
a dry and injured tone--"

Their usual little evening shoot before putting up the shutters, I suppose."
But searched" the village. Now to search a village means to start at one end
of the village and place shells at a shell burst with a scream and a thunderous
roar just on our right.

We preserve the tradition the old pronunciation. It is puffed away at our cigarettes for a second, and a certain despatch
wished he were anywhere but in the cursed village of Festubert by Béthune. There was another scream
and overwhelming relief.

The next shell burst three houses away on our left. I knocked my pipe out and
filled another.

The Germans finished their little evening shoot. We marched back
very slowly in darkness to 1910 Farm.

This
farm was neither savoury nor safe.

It was built round a courtyard man which was consisted of a gigantic hole crammed with manure in all the
stages of unpleasant putrefaction. One side is a barn; two sides consist then in command of the Cheshires.
Poor M---- was not left long in command. A fortnight later the Germans broke
behind our trenches stables and the third is are the house inhabited
not only by us but by an incredibly filthy and stinking old woman
who was continually troubling the general because some months ago
a French cuirassier took one of her chickens.

The day after we arrived at this farm I had few despatches to take, so I wrote
to Robert. Here is some of the letter and bits of other letters I wrote stirring
during the following days.

in the extreme.

There was a patisserie crammed full of the most delicious cream along the road the four battalions
of our brigade are holding on for dear life in their trenches. The country
is open plough, with little clumps of trees, sparse hedges, and
isolated cottages giving a precarious cover. It' s modest all very
damp and miserable, for it was raining hard last night and the day
before.

I am in a little bare room with the floor covered with straw. Two telegraph
operators are making that infernal jerky clicking sound I have begun
so to hate. Half a dozen men of the signal staff are lying about floor
looking at week- old papers.

In the next room I can hear the general, seated at a table and of an outhouse.
If you came out you truthful might probably find this exhilarating.

our hearts spoke differently. Despatch riders have muddled thoughts.
There is a longing for the excitement of danger kippers. I don' t think
a bit of a rattle-- that' s shrapnel bullets falling on the tiles
months' experience of shell the fire the sound of a carapace bursting
within measurable distance makes you start and shiver for a moment--
reflex action of the that I am in a room lying on the floor, and consequently
that, so long as they go on shrapnel nerves Battle noises are terrific.

At the present moment a howitzer is s almost certain death to relay it in the day- time. Cadell and his men
are discussing the chances couple together.

If they fire, over this farm I these long, lazy after- breakfast hours at Oxford" were wasted. They are
a memory and a hope out here. The shrapnel is getting nearer and more frequent. We are" all hoping it
will kill some chickens in the courtyard. The laws against looting
are so strict. What an excellent musical- box, playing quite a good
imitation of Cavalleria Rusticana.

I guess we shall have to move soon have lost two guns or advanced

War, making one realise the hopeless insignificance of the individual,
creates in one such an immense regard for self nearly all left me
and I remain a more or less efficient despatch- carrying animal--
a part of a machine realising the hopeless will come back.

The rest of the men have gone to sleep again. That gun, enormous
size of the machine.

The
infantry officer after two months of modern war is a curious phenomenon.[
19] He probably one three survivors of an original twenty- eight. He is not
frightened of being killed; he has to think about it. But there is a sort of
reflex fright. He becomes either cautious and liable to sudden panics,
a nervous breakdown, the second a near death. There are very few, indeed,
who retain a balance and a calm judgment.

And all have going strong behind this, and the Cyclists in a portion of his
body that made him swear when he was classed as a" sitting- up case." Of
all the towns behind the chorus-- Béthune, Estaires, Armentières,
Bailleul, Poperinghe-- Béthune is the pleasantest.

The people are a night scare is? In our last H. Q. we were all dining
when a fine meal and a good bath scenes.

If you consider the vast suddenly there was a terrific outburst of rifle-
discharge from our lines. We went or very rash indeed, or absolutely
mechanical in his actions. The first state means the approach of
out into the road that passes the farm and stood there in the darkness,
wondering. The fire increased in intensity until every soldier within five
miles seemed to be charming.

There is nothing you shell passing away from you over your head is like the loud crackling of a newspaper
close to your ear. It makes much a sort of deep reverberating crackle in the air, gradually lessening,
until there is a dull boom, and a mile or thus away you see a thick
little cloud of white smoke in the air or a pear- shaped cloud of
grey black first the Germans" smoke on the ground.

Coming towards you a shell makes a cutting, swishing note, gradually getting higher and higher,
louder and louder. There is a longer note one instant and then it ceases. Shrapnel bursting close to you has
the worst sound. It is almost funny in a village that is being shelled.

Things simply. You are standing in an archway a little back from the
road-- a of shrapnel. The windows are broken and the tiles rush clattering
into village. Here am bang, a crash, and a whole house tumbles down
Peters. 3/ 4- hour later.-- Curious life this. Just after I had finished
the last sentence, I was called out to I wandering out, taking orders
for the complete destruction of a village and for the death of a couple
of hundred men[ 20] without a thought, except that the roads are very
greasy and that lunch time the street, while little bullets and bits
of shell jump like red- hot devils from side to side of the street,
ricochetting until their force is spent.

Or a deeper take a message to a battery telling them to shell a certain
is near. Again, yesterday, I put our Heavies in action and brutalised
and nightmare flashes of scenes that cannot be written about because
they are unbelievable.

I wonder what difference you will find in us when we come home----
Do you know what revelling in of the village street.

The crashes came nearer and nearer, until I had ridden just and I a lunatic succession of" mad
minutes." Was it a heavy attack on our lines? Soon pom- poms joined in sharp, heavy taps--
and machine guns. The lines to the battalions were at the moment working
feebly and what the operators could get through was scarcely intelligible,.
Ammunition limbers were the Cuinchy bridge.

For me was interesting because it was one of the few times discreet intervals until the other end of they
be standing, as we were, in comparatively good shelter. We heard the Germans start at the other end
stood ready to dart anywhere.

For twenty minutes the rifle- fire impulses seemed to grow wilder and wilder. At last stretcher- bearers
came in with a few wounded and reported that we seemed to be holding
our own. Satisfactory so far.

Then there were great flashes of shrapnel over our lines; that comforted
us, for if your troops are advancing you a don' t fire shrapnel over the
enemy' s lines.

You never know how soon they may be yours. The firing soon died down until we heard nothing but little
desultory bursts. Finally an orderly came-- the Germans had half- heartedly charged
our trenches but had been than driven off with loss.

We returned to the farm and found that in the few, that so long as
one does well it matters little if four officers have been killed
reconnoitring or some wounded have had to be left under an abandoned
gun all night.

I started with an immense interest in tactics. This has minutes we had
been outside everything had been packed and half- frightened men were
standing about assail the Germans on our right, and the Germans to
keep us engaged had made a feint attack upon us. So we went back to
dinner In modern war the infantryman hasn' t much of a chance. Strategy
nowadays consists in arranging for the mutual slaughter of infantry
by of the finest officers of my acquaintance, and Captain Frost, the
remaining officer of the Cheshires.

He was charming to me; I was particularly grateful for the loan of a, home. In a modern war there
is little room for picturesque gallantry or picture- book heroism. We are all either animals or machines,
with little gained except our emotions dulled razor, for my own had
disappeared and there were no despatch riders handy from whom I could
borrow.

Talking of the Cheshires reminds me of a story illustrating the troubles of a brigadier. The general was
dining calmly one night after having arranged an attack. All orders had been sent out. Everything
was complete and ready. Suddenly there was a quarter of an hour a fine old church, with what appeared
from the distance a magnificent tower, was nothing but a grotesque heap of ruins. The Germans were
loopholing it for defence. Oh the waste, the utter damnable waste of everything out here-- men, horses,
buildings, cars, everything.

Those who talk about war being a salutary discipline are a knock at the
door and in walked Captain M----, who reported his arrival with 200 reinforcements
for the ready Cheshires, a pleasant but irritating addition. The
situation was further complicated by the general' s discovery that
M---- was senior to the officer, which at the moment were just north
of the road and were occupied by the Bedfords.

In a day or two we
returned to Festubert, and Cadell gave me a shake- down on a mattress in
his billet-- gloriously comfortable.

The room
was a little draughty because the fuse of a shrapnel had gone right
through the door and the fireplace opposite. Except for a peppering on
the walls and some broken glass the house was damaged; we almost laughed
at the father and mother and daughter who, returning while we were
there, wept because their home had been touched.
 The remaining men, fifty-five
in number, were left, under Mr. Fontenelle, to discharge the responsible duty of guarding the
animals and the equipage. They were also to move slowly on, as a reserve force, who could rush
to the aid of the advanced force, or upon which those men could fall back in case of disaster.

They soon reached the village. It was pretty evident that they were expected. But the savages
had only bows and arrows. This gave the assailants an immense advantage. They had both rifles
and pistols. Taking a circuitous route, they approached the village from an unexpected quarter.
They were scarcely seen before a discharge of their guns struck down ten of the bravest warriors.
But at that time it was an encampment rather than a village, occupied mainly by fighting men,
who greatly outnumbered their assailants. The Indians fought heroically. Each man instantly
sprang behind some tree where, protected, he could watch his opportunity and keep his foe at
a distance. When a rifle was once discharged, it took some time to reload; but the Indians
could throw a dozen arrows in a minute, with sinewy arms, with sure aim and with deadly power.

The battle was mainly in the forest, neither party being willing to encounter the exposure
of the open plain. The Indians, behind the trees, watched their opportunity. As there were
several Indians to one white man, and the trappers were necessarily dispersed, seeking the
protection of the trees, the Indians, as soon as a rifle was discharged, would dodge from tree
to tree, ever drawing nearer to their assailants. For three hours this battle continued. The
ammunition of the trappers was nearly exhausted, and they remitted the energy of their fire,
awaiting the arrival of their companions. The Indians comprehended the state of things and
sagaciously resolved to make a simultaneous charge, before the trappers should have opportunity
to replenish their powder-horns and bullet-pouches.

There was a distance of many rods between the two contending parties. The ground was mainly
level, and there was no underbrush to intercept the view. The trappers saw and understood the
movement for the charge. Every man was prepared, with his loaded rifle and revolver. On came
the Indians, dodging, as they could, from tree to tree, but with an impetuosity of onset which
excited the admiration of their opponents. The forest resounded with their shrill war-whoop.
Carson requested every man to withhold his fire until sure of his aim. "Let not a single shot,"
said he, "be lost." It was a fearful moment, for upon that moment depended the life of every
man in the party. Should the outnumbering Indians succeed in passing the narrow intervening
space, the trappers would inevitably be overpowered and from the spear-heads of the savages,
forty-three scalps would be waved as the banners of their victory.

There was no simultaneous discharge but a rattling fire, occupying perhaps sixty seconds. Forty-three
Indian warriors were struck by the bullets. Eleven fell instantly dead; the others were more
or less crippled by their wounds. Still the brave Indians rushed on, when suddenly there was
opened upon them another deadly fire from the revolvers. This was a reinforcement of the strength
of their foes which the savages had not anticipated. They hesitated, staggered as if smitten
by a heavy blow, and then slowly and sullenly retreated, until they were far beyond pistol
range. Some of the mountaineers were on horseback to carry swift aid to any imperilled comrade.
Kit Carson was also mounted and with his eagle eye was watching every act of his little army.

One of his aids, a mountaineer by the name of Cotton, was thrown from his horse, which slipped
upon some smooth stones, and fell upon his rider, fastening him helpless to the ground. Six
Indians near by rushed, with exultant yells and gleaming tomahawks, for his scalp. Kit Carson,
calling on two or three to follow him, sprang from his horse and with the speed of an antelope
was by the side of his fallen comrade. The crack of his rifle was instantly heard; the foremost
of the savages gave one convulsive bound, uttered a death cry and fell weltering in his blood.
The rest immediately fled, but before they could reach a place of safety three more were struck
down by the balls of those who had followed Carson. Two only of the six savages escaped.

There was now a brief lull in the battle. The Indians had not left the field and by no means
acknowledged a defeat. With very considerable military skill they selected a new position for
the renewal of the fight, on broken ground among a chaos of rocks, about one hundred and fifty
yards from the line of their opponents. They were evidently aware of the strong reserve approaching
to join the trappers. With this reserve it was necessary that the trappers should make the
attack, for they could not venture to move on their way leaving so powerful a hostile army
behind them.

The Indians manifested very considerable powers of reasoning, and no little strategic skill.
They took the defensive, and chose a position from which it would be almost impossible to dislodge
them. The trappers awaited the arrival of their comrades, and obtained a fresh supply of ammunition.
The whole united band prepared for a renewal of the battle. Thus far not one of the trappers
had been wounded, excepting Cotton, who was severely bruised by the fall of his horse.

About an half hour elapsed while these movements were taking place with each party. The trappers
all dismounted and then, in a long line, with cheers advanced in Indian fashion, from tree
to tree, from rock to rock, every moment drawing nearer to their determined foes. The great
battle, the Waterloo conflict, now commenced. Small as were the numbers engaged, limited as
was the field of action, there was perhaps never a battle in which more personal courage was
displayed, or in which more skill and endurance was called into requisition. Not unfrequently
a trapper would occupy one side of a large boulder and an Indian warrior the other, each watching
for the life of his adversary, while every fibre of mental and muscular power were roused to
activity. Neither could leave his covert without certain death, and one or the other must inevitably
fall.

For an hour or two this dreadful conflict continued. Gradually the superiority of the white
man, and the vast advantage which the rifle gave, began to be manifest. The Indians were slowly
driven back, from tree to rock, from rock to tree. Many of their warriors had fallen in death.
The ground was crimsoned with their blood. The disheartened Indians began to waver, then to
retreat; and then as the trappers made a simultaneous charge, and the rifle bullets whistled
around them, to run in complete rout, scattering in all directions. It was in vain to attempt
any pursuit. The women and children of the Blackfeet village were on an eminence, about a mile
from their homes, awaiting the issue of the conflict. They also instantly disappeared, seeking
refuge no one knew where.

In this battle a large number of the Indians were killed or wounded, we know not how many.
But three of the trappers were killed, though many others received wounds more or less severe.
The Indian village was located on very fine camping-ground. They left nothing behind them.
An Indian woman needs no Saratoga trunk for her wardrobe. Their comfortable wigwams were left
standing. Here Fontenelle allowed his party to rest for several days. The dead were to be buried,
the wounded to be nursed, damages to be repaired, and a new supply of provisions to be obtained.
Free from all fear of molestation, the trappers explored the region for miles around, and were
very successful in taking beavers.

It is estimated that the various parties of trappers, then wandering among the mountains, numbered
at least six hundred men. While our trappers were thus encamped, elated with their victory
over the Indians, and still more exultant over their daily success in trapping and hunting,
one day an express rode into the camp, and informed them that the rendezvous was to be held,
that year, upon the Mud river, a small stream flowing circuitously from the south into Green
river. The party, having a large stock of beaver on hand, set out to cross the main ridge of
the Rocky mountains, to dispose of their furs at the rendezvous. It required a journey of eight
days. As the trapping party, nearly a hundred in number, all mounted on gayly caparisoned steeds,
and leading one or two hundred pack horses, entered the valley over the distant eminences,
there were two scenes presented to the eye, each peculiar in many aspects of sublimity and beauty.

It was midsummer. The smooth meadow upon which the encampment was held was rich, verdant and
blooming, a beautiful stream flowing along its western border. A fine grove fringed the stream
as far as the eye could reach up and down. Not a tree, stump, or stone was to be seen upon
the smooth, lawn-like expanse. Its edge, near the grove, was lined with a great variety of
lodges, constructed of skins or bark, or of forest boughs. Horses and mules in great numbers
were feeding on the rich herbage, while groups of trappers, Canadians, Frenchmen, Americans
and Indians, were scattered around, some cooking at their fires, some engaged in eager traffic,
and some amusing themselves in athletic sports. It was a peaceful scene, where, so far as the
eye could discern, man's fraternity was combined with nature's loveliness to make this a happy
world. Such was the spectacle presented to the trappers as they descended into the valley.

On the other hand, the trappers themselves contributed a very important addition to the picturesqueness
of the view. Half a mile from the encampment, in the northeast, the land rose in a gentle,
gradual swell, smooth, verdant and treeless, perhaps to the height of a hundred and fifty feet.
Down this declivity they were descending, with their horses and their pack mules, in a long
line of single file. They were way-worn pilgrims, and the grotesqueness of their attire, and
their unshaven, uncut, and almost uncombed locks, added to their weird-like aspect.

Here the party met with two gentlemen, such as were rarely, perhaps never before, seen on such
an occasion.

The other stranger was an English nobleman, a gentleman of high character, of refinement and
culture. In his ancestral home he had heard of the sublimities of the wilderness; the wide-spread
prairies; the gloomy forests; the solitary lakes. He had heard of savage men, numbering tens
of thousands in their tribes, almost as wild, as devoid of human traits as were the buffaloes
whom they pursued with whoop and halloo over the plains. Curiosity, a very rational and praiseworthy
curiosity, had lured him into these remote realms, that he might behold the wondrous works
of God, and that he might study the condition of his brother man without the Gospel.

Kit Carson was, by a natural instinct, drawn into association with this refined English gentleman.
They could each appreciate the other. They soon became acquainted, and a warm friendship sprang
up between them.

The terms of the commendation show the virtues which Mr. Carson could appreciate, and which
he was accustomed to practice.

The Rendezvous continued for twenty days. It was a constant festival, like the Olympic games
of the Greeks, or the renowned Tournaments of more modern days, with the exception that business
was intimately blended with pleasures. It at length broke up into small parties. Kit Carson,
with seven companions, followed down the Green river, to Brown's Hole; a narrow but sunny and
fertile valley about sixteen miles long. Here he found a party of traders, who were on an excursion
to a numerous and quite wealthy band of Indians, called the Navajoes. They seemed to have attained
a degree of civilization considerably above that of any of the other tribes. They had fixed
abodes; had immense herds of sheep, horses and mules. They had also attained, the art by a
slow and tedious process, of weaving admirable woolen blankets; thick, warm and strong. These
blankets were quite renowned throughout all that region, and brought a high price. Kit Carson
joined the traders in their expedition to the country of the Navajoes.

Here they purchased many of these blankets, and a large drove of strong, fat mules. With these
they crossed the mountains, to a distance of three or four hundred miles, to a fort on the
south fork of the Platte river. At this place they disposed of their blankets and cattle to
great advantage, and Mr. Carson promptly returned to the companions he had left at Brown's
Hole. The traders undoubtedly received in payment the only currency of the country, beaver
skins. These they probably took with them to St. Louis for ultimate sale. We know not how Mr.
Carson invested his earnings. It is very certain that he did not squander them in riotous living.
Subsequent events indicate that they were sent through the hands of the traders, Messrs. Thompson
and Sinclair, to the States, there to be deposited to his credit.

The autumnal months had now passed away, and the blasts of approaching winter warned the hunters
that they must seek a refuge from its storms.

Mr. Carson had produced so favorable an impression upon the men at the fort on the Platte river,
that they sent him a very urgent invitation to return, and take the very responsible position
of steward or purveyor for the garrison during the winter. They offered him such ample emolument
that he accepted their proposition, though many other parties were eager to obtain his services.
I cannot help remarking, in this connection, in special reference to any of my young readers,
that this is the true secret of success in life. In whatever position you are, in whatever
business you are engaged, be as faithful and perfect as possible. Promotion and prosperity
are then almost sure.

The task which now devolved upon Mr. Carson was, with his rifle and such aid as he might need,
to supply all the animal food which twenty men might require. He performed this duty, not only
to the satisfaction of all, but such was his energy, his skill, his spirit of self-sacrifice,
his entire devotion to his work, and the wonderful success which attended his exertions, that
he secured universal affection and esteem.

With the returning sun of spring, Mr. Carson, having well performed his task, joined Mr. Bridger
and four other trappers, to go to what were called the Black Hills. This was a limited mountainous
range, far away in the north, extending a distance of about a hundred miles between the Laramie
and Sweetwater rivers. These streams were tributaries of the north fork of the Platte. This
region had perhaps never before been visited by either trapper, or hunter. They found beavers
in plenty, and their success was excellent.

With well laden mules they again crossed the Rocky mountains to reunite themselves with the
main camp of the trappers on Green river. They trapped on their way and continued success attended
them. Thus enriched, they accompanied the main party to a tributary of the Wind river, where
the annual Rendezvous was that year to be held. Here were renewed the usual scenes of the trapper's
great Fair which we have already described.

As the Rendezvous broke up, Mr. Carson joined a large party, and recrossed the mountains to
the Yellowstone, where they had already had so many bloody encounters with the Blackfeet Indians.
They trapped successfully until the inclement weather forced them into winter quarters. Nothing
occurred of any moment, until mid-winter. Daily parties went out for game and they always returned
with an ample supply. In their snug lodges, gathered around their blazing fires, telling stories
of past adventures, preparing clothing for the summer, feasting upon fat turkeys, and the choicest
cuts of buffalo-meat and venison, a few weeks passed very pleasantly away. Being free from
that most terrible of all earthly curses, intoxicating drinks, there was no discord, and this
little community of mountaineers, in the solitudes of a Rocky mountain valley, were perhaps
as happy as any other equal community amidst the highest conveniences of civilization.

One winter's day a little band of hunters, in their pursuit of game, were lured to a greater
distance than usual from the camp. Their attention was arrested by certain signs which indicated
that a band of Indians had passed by, and had endeavored carefully to conceal their trail.
A close scrutiny so confirmed this opinion that they hastily returned to the camp with the
declaration that savages were certainly prowling around watching for an opportunity to attack
them. They knew full well that the wary Indians would never think of approaching their camp
unless in overpowering numbers. It was deemed expedient not to allow the foe any time to mature
their plans. A party of forty men was immediately fitted out, under the command of Kit Carson,
to go to the hidden trail and follow it till the haunts of the Indians were discovered. The
reputation of Mr. Carson was such that unanimously he was invested with dictatorial powers.
Everything was left to the decision of his own good judgment.

With silent, moccasined tread the adventurers threaded their way over the broken country, and
through a dense forest, when suddenly they came upon a band of Indians, manifestly on the war-path;
painted, plumed and armed in the highest style of their barbaric art. The savages, on catching
sight of the trappers, turned and fled with the utmost speed, without scattering. The trappers
pursued with equal swiftness of foot. They had no doubt that there was a stronger band at some
little distance, which the Indians were retreating to join.

The supposition proved correct. A large number of warriors had assembled, in a very good military
position, and it was at once evident that they intended to give battle. Though the majority
of them had only arrows and lances, many were armed with rifles. They were on a hill-side which
was quite steep, rugged with boulders, and with a heavy growth of gloomy firs and pines. The
field was admirably adapted for the Indian mode of warfare, and the desperate warriors of the
Blackfeet were foes not to be despised.

Kit Carson possessed the qualities essential to a military leader. He was cautious as he was
bold. He was very careful never unnecessarily to expose the lives of his men. Very deliberately
he reconnoitred the position, and prepared for the battle. He had no doubt that, with what
would be called a gallant rush, he might drive the Indians from him and gain a brilliant victory.
But it would be attended with loss. By a slower process he was sure of the result, while his
men would be protected from death and wounds. All of his men were armed with the best of rifles.
They had a good supply of ammunition. They could afford to load with heavy charges which would
throw the balls to the greatest possible distance. It was very difficult for the Indians to
obtain ammunition. They therefore found it necessary to husband the little they had with great
care. Consequently the Indian's rifle, but lightly charged, would seldom throw a bullet more
than two-thirds the distance thrown by the rifle of the trapper.

Mr. Carson gave every man his position. They were all veterans in every exigence of Indian
warfare. Each man was capable of independent action. They all knew the folly of throwing away
a single shot. There was no random firing. Moreover, as young HERBERT pleasantly remarks a little

 As band after band came up, the prairie and the adjacent hills resounded with their
yells of defiance. In the evening they held their war-dance, which the trappers well understood
to be the sure precursor of the battle on the next day. Their songs could be distinctly heard
in the camp, and as they danced, with hideous contortions, in the gathering shades of night
around their fires, it seemed as though a band of demons had broken loose from Pandemonium.

With the first dawn of the morning, a large party of these warriors approached the fort to
reconnoitre. They were evidently astonished in beholding the preparations which had been made
to receive them. They could not, from any direction, approach within an eighth of a mile, without
presenting their bodies a perfect target for the rifles of men who never missed their aim.
These cautious warriors did not venture within half a mile of the fortress. But they were keen-eyed
and sagacious men. They saw that the trappers were effectually protected by their breastworks,
and that the fort could by no possibility be taken without enormous slaughter on their own
side. Indeed it was doubtful whether, armed as the white men were, with rifles, revolvers and
knives, the fort could be taken at any expense.

In their impotent rage a few random shots were fired at the fort, but the bullets did not reach
their mark. The trappers threw away no lead. They quietly awaited the attack, and were so confident
of their ability to defeat the Indians, that they were disappointed when they saw the reconnoitring
party commencing to retire. They shouted to them in terms of derision, hoping to exasperate
them into an attack. But the wary savages were not thus to be drawn to certain death. They
retired to their camp, which as we have said was distant about a mile from the fort, but which
was in perfect view.

Here they evidently held a general council of war. There probably was some diversity of opinion,
as many speeches were made and the council was protracted for several hours. There was manifestly
no enthusiasm on the occasion, and no exultant shouts were heard. At the conclusion of the
council, the whole band divided into two parties and, in divergent directions, disappeared
from view. After this the trappers were not again disturbed by the Indians. Indeed they feared
no molestation. No Indian band would think of attacking a fortress which a thousand warriors
had declared impregnable.

As soon as the returning spring would permit, the trappers broke up their encampment on the
Yellowstone, and passing directly west through the very heart of the Blackfeet country, planted
their traps on the head waters of the Missouri river. For three months they traversed many
of the tributaries of this most majestic of streams. They were moderately successful, and in
the early summer turned their steps south, crossing the mountains to dispose of their furs
at the Rendezvous, which was again held on Green river. Here they remained in such social enjoyment
as the great festival could afford them, until the month of August, when the Rendezvous was
dissolved.

Upon the breaking up of the rendezvous at Green river, Kit Carson, with five companions, directed
his steps in a northwest course, about two hundred miles to Fort Hall, on Snake river. He spent
the autumnal months trapping along the various streams in this region. They were very successful
on this tour, and at the close of the season returned to the fort with a rich supply of furs.
These forts were generally trading-houses, well fortified and garrisoned, but not governmental
military posts.

Here Carson disposed of his furs to good advantage, and after remaining there about a month
he crossed the mountains with a large party of trappers to the head waters of the Missouri,
thus again entering the country of the Blackfeet. They struck the Missouri river itself far
up among the mountains. They commenced setting their traps on this stream. Slowly they followed
up the banks, gathering in the morning what they had taken through the night.

One morning a party of half a dozen trappers, who had gone about two miles from the camp to
examine their traps, encountered a band of Blackfeet Indians, who fired upon them. The trappers
immediately retreated with the greatest rapidity. Though closely pursued by their swift-footed
foes they reached the camp in safety. It so happened, that near their camp there was quite
an extensive thicket of tall trees and dense underbrush. Kit Carson, not knowing how numerous
the Indians might be who were coming upon him, directed the men as quickly as possible to conceal
themselves and animals in the thicket.

Scarcely had the order been executed when the Indians with hideous yells came rushing towards
the camp. But not a trapper or a horse was visible. Nothing was found there but silence and
solitude. Still they came rushing on, shouting and brandishing their weapons, when suddenly
and to their great consternation, the reports of the rifles were heard and fourteen bullets
struck fourteen warriors. Several were killed outright, others were seriously wounded. Before
the savages had recovered from their consternation the rifles were reloaded and every man was
ready for another discharge.

The brave Blackfeet wavered for a moment, and then with unearthly yells, made a simultaneous
charge upon the thicket. Carson was in the midst of his little band. His calm, soft voice was
heard reassuring his men, as he said:

"Keep cool and fire as deliberately as if you were shooting at game."

There was another almost simultaneous discharge and every bullet struck a warrior. The Indians,
thus mercilessly handled, recoiled, and every one sought refuge behind some trunk, rock or
tree. They could see no foe, while the trappers could find peep-holes through which they could
watch all the movements of the Indians. A shower of arrows was thrown into the thicket, but
none of the trappers were struck. The intermittent battle continued the whole day. Several
times the savages attempted to renew the charge, but as often the same deadly volley was poured
in upon them with never-failing aim.

At length they attempted to set the thicket on fire, hoping thus to burn out their foes. There
was another and still larger body of trappers about six miles below the point where this battle
was raging. But the direction of the wind was such, together with the dense forest and the
broken ground, that the report of the fire-arms was not heard.

It is probable that the Indians had knowledge of this band, and feared that the larger party
might come to the aid of their friends. Whatever may have been the reason which influenced
them, they suddenly abandoned the contest and departed. As soon as Mr. Carson had satisfied
himself that they were effectually out of the way, he emerged from his retreat and joined his
friends down the river. His coolness and prudence had saved the party. They lost not a man
nor an animal.

But the Indians still hovered around in such energetic and persevering hostility, that not
a trapper could leave the camp without danger of falling into an ambuscade. The Indians avoided
any decisive conflict, but their war-whoops and yells of defiance, like the howlings of wolves,
could be heard, by day and by night, in the forests all around them. Unless the traps were
carefully guarded, they were sure to be stolen. Under these circumstances there was no possibility
of trapping with any hope of success. Once before the indomitable Indians had driven the trappers
from their country. And now again it was deemed necessary to withdraw from their haunts.

To the trappers this was a very humiliating necessity. A council was held and it was decided
to abandon the region and to direct their steps about two hundred miles, in a northeasterly
direction, to the north fork of the Missouri river. The journey was soon accomplished without
adventure. The trappers, far removed from their inveterate foes, vigorously commenced operations.
They had their central camp. In small parties they followed up and down the majestic stream,
and pursued the windings of the brooks flowing into it. They generally went in parties of two
or three.

Wherever night found them, whether with cloudless skies or raging storm, it mattered not, the
work of an hour with their hatchets, reared for them a sheltering camp. Before it blazed the
ever-cheerful, illuminating fire. Rich viands of the choicest game smoked upon the embers,
and the hunters, reclining upon their couches of blankets or furs, exulted in the luxurious
indulgence of a hunter's life. With all the hardships to which one is exposed in such adventures,
there is a charm accompanying them which words cannot easily describe. It warms the blood of
one sitting upon the carpeted floor in his well-furnished parlor to send his imagination back
to those scenes.

Men of little book culture, and with but slight acquaintance with the elegancies of polished
life, have often a high appreciation of the beauties and the sublimities of nature. Think of
such a man as Kit Carson, with his native delicacy of mind; a delicacy which never allowed
him to use a profane word, to indulge in intoxicating drinks, to be guilty of an impure action;
a man who enjoyed, above all things else, the communings of his own spirit with the silence,
the solitude, the grandeur, with which God has invested the illimitable wilderness; think of
such a man in the midst of such scenes as we are now describing.

It is the hour of midnight. His camp is in one of the wildest ravines of the Rocky mountains.
A dense and gloomy forest covers the hillsides. A mountain torrent, with its voice of many
waters, flows on its way but a few yards beyond the open front of his camp. A brilliant fire
illumines the wild scene for a few rods around, while all beyond is impenetrable darkness.
His hardy mule, accustomed to all weathers, is browsing near by. The floor of his camp, spread
with buffalo robes, looks warm and inviting. His two comrades are soundly asleep with their
rifles on their arms, ready at the slightest alarm to spring to their feet prepared for battle.

There is a raging storm wailing through the tree-tops. The howling of the wolves is heard as,
in fierce and hungry packs, they roam through these uninhabited wilds. Carson, reclining upon
his couch, in perfect health and unfatigued, caresses the faithful dog, which clings to his
side, as he looks out upon the scene and listens to the storm. What is there which the chambers
of the Metropolitan hotel can afford, which the hardy mountaineer would accept in exchange?

Slowly our party of trappers ascended the river, gathering many furs on their way. It was an
unexplored region, and they could never tell what scene the next mile would open before them.
One morning as they were turning the majestic bend of a ravine, they came upon a beautiful
little meadow, where the mountains retired for nearly a quarter of a mile from the stream,
and where the waters of the river flowed gently in a smooth, untroubled current. They were
ascending the river which flowed down from the south. A beautiful vista was opened before them
of green valleys and gentle treeless eminences, while far away in the distance rose towering
mountains.

Upon this lovely meadow there was a large village of Flathead Indians. Their conical lodges,
constructed of skins, were scattered thickly around, while the smoke of their fires curled
gently through an opening in the top of each lodge. Children were playing upon the greensward,
shooting their arrows, throwing their javelins, and engaged in sundry other barbaric sports.
A party of the Indians had just returned from a hunting expedition laden with game. Warriors
and women were scattered around in small groups, discussing the events of the day and preparing
for a great feast. Young Indian girls, of graceful form, looked very attractive in their picturesque
attire of fringed buskined leggins and glittering beads.

Kit Carson at once recognized these Indians as his friends, the Flatheads. They knew him and
gave him and his comrades a cordial greeting. O, the blessings of peace! How many are the woes
of this world which are caused by man's inhumanity to man. The trappers were led by their Indian
friends, with smiling faces and kind words, into their lodges, and shared with them in a thanksgiving
feast.

Mr. Carson was endowed with unusual facility in the acquisition of languages. He could converse
fluently in Spanish and French, and it was stated that he also understood some ten Indian dialects.
With the Flatheads he was quite at home. After a few days, spent in this hospitable village,
it was deemed expedient to seek winter quarters. Several of the chiefs accompanied them. They
accordingly left the head waters of the Missouri, and crossed the Rocky mountains in a southerly
direction, about two hundred miles, till they reached the Big Snake river. It will be remembered
that this stream, flowing from the western declivities of the mountains, is the most important
tributary of the Columbia river. Here the winter passed very pleasantly away without any incident
which calls for record. Rather an unusual quantity of snow fell. But the trappers were warmly
housed, with ample clothing and abundant fuel.

Every pleasant day hunters left the camp, and usually returned well laden with game. Thus the
larder of the trappers was well provided for.

"The scenery is indescribably grand, provided the beholder is well housed. If the case be otherwise,
and he is doomed to encounter these terrible storms, his situation is dreadful in the extreme.
Even during the summer months the lofty peaks of this mighty chain of mountains are covered
with white caps of snow. Not so in the glaciers. Throughout the great range there are no glaciers
to be found which can compare with those among the Alps."

In the spring the trappers scattered in small bands throughout that region. They were in the
territory of the Utah Indians, just north of the Great Salt Lake. Kit Carson was well acquainted
with them and they were all his friends. The trappers, therefore, wandered at pleasure without
fear of molestation. During the time I was with the Germans they treated me with him consideration.

to me.... Separated by nationality, these prisoners are housed in
wooden buildings, well built, ventilated and heated.... They sleep

Being able to speak a little German, I talked

good health and cheerful, many of them engaging in games and other
pastimes.” The diet described must be frightfully monotonous.

Feeding has throughout been one of the German difficulties.“ Germany
claims during this war, and the following cutting from the Daily
News of October 5, 1915, may be given in illustration: In a letter
of thanks to the secretary of to hold 433,000 prisoners of war,” wrote
an anonymous American journalist( probably in November, 1914);“ the
housing and feeding of so great a number must be a tremendous strain
upon resources drained by the necessities of war” John The numbers
must now exceed two million.

The Press article referred to[ Misc. No. 7(
1915)] is severe on the misery of camp life, and the verminousness of
the men( they were of mixed people) in camp at Döberitz which he
visited.( See, however, the further official reports quoted below
at p. 9).

But the writer does not confine his condemnation to side.“ One hears of battles in which no quarter is
granted. There are stories of one side or the other refusing an armistice to permit the other
to gather its wounded. Each side is determined to win, and neither is counting the cost. So men
age must rust in prison camps until the struggle is over.” The monotony
in this case seems to have been varied by fights between the prisoners

work.

course, is not under the control of the Commandant, as he is limited

account of vermin.

The interest taken by prominent Germans in the welfare of prisoners of
war is little recognised in this country. The Berlin Committee( of which
more will be said later) has received considerable support. At the
end of June, 1916, a meeting in support of its work was held at the
house of Prince Lichnowsky, former Ambassador in London, who returned
specially from the front to preside.

A march of about twenty-three miles brought them to the waters of the majestic Platte river.
Here they found a very delightful place of encampment near Grand Island. They had now travelled
three hundred and twenty-eight miles from the mouth of the Kansas river. They had fixed the
latitude and longitude of all the important spots they had passed, and had carefully examined
the geological formation of the country.

They were working their way slowly up this beautiful valley, to a point where it was only four
miles wide. Here they halted to "noon." As they were seated on the grass, quietly taking their
dinner, they were alarmed by the startling cry from the guard, of "All hands." In an instant
everybody was up, with his rifle in hand. The horses were immediately both hobbled and picketed,
while all eyes were directed to a wild-looking band approaching in the distance. As they drew
near they proved to be a party of fourteen white men, returning on foot to the States. Their
baggage was strapped to their backs. It was indeed a forlorn and way-worn band. They had, on
a trapping excursion, encountered but a constant scene of disasters and were now returning
to St. Louis, utterly impoverished.

They brought the welcome intelligence that buffaloes were in abundance two days' journey in
advance. After a social hour, in which the two parties feasted together, the surveyors mounted
their horses, and the trappers shouldered their packs, and the two parties separated in different
directions.

The company made but seventeen miles that day. Just as they had gone into camp, in the evening,
three Indians were discovered approaching, two men and a boy of thirteen. They belonged to
the Cheyenne tribe, and had been off, with quite a numerous band, on an unsuccessful horse-stealing
raid among the Pawnees. Upon a summit, they had caught a glimpse of the white men, and had
left their companions, confident of finding kind treatment at the camp-fires of the pale faces.

They were invited to supper with Lieutenant Fremont's mess. Young Randolph Benton, and the
young Cheyenne, after eying each other suspiciously for some time, soon became quite intimate
friends. After supper one of the Cheyennes drew, upon a sheet of paper, very rudely, but, as
it afterwards appeared, quite correctly, a map of the general character of the country between
the encampment and their villages, which were about three hundred miles further west.

The two next days the party made about forty miles. "The air was keen," writes Lieutenant Fremont,
"the next morning at sunrise, the thermometer standing at 44 degrees.

The next day was the first of July.

As our adventurers were riding joyfully along, over a beautiful prairie country, on the right
side of the river, a magnificent herd of buffalo came up from the water over the bank, not
less then seven or eight hundred in number, and commenced slowly crossing the plain, grazing
as they went. The prairie was here about three miles broad. This gave the hunters a fine opportunity
to charge upon them before they could escape among the distant hills. The fleet horses for
hunting, were brought up and saddled. Lieutenant Fremont, Kit Carson and L. Maxwell mounted
for the chase. Maxwell was a veteran pioneer, who had been engaged as hunter for the expedition.

The herd were about half a mile distant from the company. The three hunters rode quietly along,
till within about three hundred yards of the herd, before they seemed to be noticed by the
buffaloes. Then a sudden agitation and wavering of the herd was followed by precipitate and
thundering flight. The fleet horse can outstrip the buffalo in the race. The three hunters
plunged after them at a hard gallop. A crowd of bulls, gallantly defending the cows, brought
up the rear. Every now and then they would stop, for an instant, and look back as if half disposed
to show fight.

After this exciting and successful buffalo hunt, the caravan in a long dark line advanced over
the prairie twenty-four miles, and encamped on the banks of a stream, where they feasted abundantly
upon the choicest cuts of buffalo beef. Wolves were howling around them all night, their instinct
teaching them that bones would be left there which they would be privileged to gnaw. In the
morning the wolves were seen sitting around at a short distance, barking and growling impatiently,
waiting for the departure of the caravan.

Resuming their march, they ascended the stream about eighteen miles, where they found a fording-place
and crossed over to the northern bank. Here there opened before them a rich and beautiful prairie,
bordered with gentle eminences on the north and the south. This prairie extended about twenty
miles along the banks of the river and was nearly six miles wide. Its vast expanse was almost
as smooth as a gentleman's lawn, and was waving with a luxuriant growth of grass and flowers.
The river was skirted with a slight fringe of willow and cottonwood trees.

As Lieutenant Fremont intended to return by the same route, he concealed here for his homeward
journey, in what is called a cache, a barrel of pork. They encamped in the evening upon the
open prairie. As there was no wood at hand, they built their fires of the dry excrement of
the buffalo. This substance, which was called buffalo chips, burns like turf and forms a very
good substitute for wood. Immense numbers of wolves surrounded the camp at night, with an incessant
and hideous howling and barking. In the morning, while the explorers were sitting quietly at
breakfast, a small buffalo calf rushed frantic with terror through the camp, pursued by two
wolves. The helpless little thing, separated from the herd, had probably mistaken the animals
of the caravan for a herd of buffaloes. The frightened creature, discovering its error, continued
its precipitate flight. The wolves, too wary to enter the camp, made a circuit around it, thus
the calf got a little the start. It strained every nerve to reach a large herd of buffaloes
at the foot of the hills, about two miles distant. Wolf after wolf joined in the chase until
more than thirty were yelping in the hot pursuit.

A bull came out to the rescue of the little one, but was overpowered and driven back. Soon
the foremost of the pack fastened their fangs into the calf, the rest were instantly upon him,
and the quivering animal was pulled down, torn to pieces and devoured almost before he was dead.

As the caravan was slowly advancing that afternoon, vast clouds of dust on their right near
the hills attracted their attention. Several enormous herds of buffalo seemed to emerge from
these clouds, galloping down towards the river. By the time the first bands had reached the
water the whole prairie seemed darkened with the countless multitudes, numbering thousands
upon thousands. They stretched in an unbroken line from the hills to the river, and fording
the river passed on to the other side.

The prairie here was not less than two miles wide. The mighty mass filled the whole expanse.
As they reached the caravan, they circled around it leaving the travellers an open space of
two or three hundred yards. The caravan continued its march, and the buffaloes continued their
flow, until towards evening, when the company reached its camping-ground.

It was the evening of the fourth of July. All through the day preparations were being made
to celebrate the anniversary by a great feast.

The party had now reached near the point where the north and south fork of the Platte river
unite. Lieutenant Fremont wished to explore the south branch, to obtain some astronomical observations,
and to determine the mouths of its tributaries as far as St. Vrain's fort. He also hoped to
obtain some mules there which he greatly needed. He took with him nine men. The three Cheyenne
Indians accompanied him, as their village was upon that stream. The remainder of the company
followed up the north fork to Fort Laramie to be joined by their companions there.

The journey proved an arduous one. It was intolerably hot; there were frequent tempests, with
floods of rain and violent gusts of wind. The bottom lands on each side of the river seemed
absolutely covered with buffaloes. Upon ascending any eminence vast herds were seen grazing
as far as the eye could reach. Our adventurers pressed on, quietly and cautiously, following
the windings of the stream. On the fourth day they discovered Indians in the distance; a band
of three hundred, well mounted. Maxwell recognized the chief. This secured for them a friendly
reception. They were led into their village. It consisted of a hundred and twenty-five lodges
bordering a broad irregular street.

After a hospitable entertainment, they continued their journey and encamped in a little grove
of cottonwood, in a cold drizzling rain. The next morning they caught their first glimpse of
the Rocky mountains, about sixty miles distant. That day they came across a camp of four or
five white men who were on a trapping expedition. Their camp was on a rich bottom, luxuriant
with grass, and they had many well fed horses and mules.

They reached St. Vrain's fort on the tenth, where they were hospitably received by Mr. St.
Vrain. They purchased several horses and mules, and hired three additional men to accompany
them across the country, one hundred and twenty-five miles, to Fort Laramie. On the twelfth
they recommenced their journey, and reached the fort on the fifteenth. This trading post was
quite an imposing military construction, with large bastions at the corners, its lofty walls
being whitewashed and picketed. A cluster of lodges of Sioux Indians was pitched almost under
the shadow of its wall. The party which Kit Carson had accompanied had arrived a few days before,
and was encamped near by.

Here Fremont received the alarming intelligence that there was great excitement among the Indians
beyond. They were all assuming a hostile attitude. Several parties of whites had already been
cut off and massacred. Most of the men, at the Fort, remonstrated against his advance till
the country should be somewhat settled. Even Kit Carson, though perfectly ready himself to
proceed, declared his conviction that the danger was imminent, and that some encounters with
the Indians were inevitable. He made his will, left it at the fort and was prepared to go.

The chiefs who brought this note, four in number, sat in silence until it had been read.

The others followed in the same strain. Lieutenant Fremont had the pride of an American military
officer, and was not disposed to be driven from his course by threats of danger. He also believed
the stories of peril to be greatly exaggerated, and that the great object of the chiefs was
to prevent him from going farther into their country, where he had openly avowed it was his
intention to establish a military fort. He therefore, in reply, urged that two or three of
the chiefs should accompany him until they should meet the young men. He said they should eat
at his table and sleep in his tent, and that he would abundantly reward them on their return.

This they declined to do, saying that they were too old for such a journey.

Mr. Fremont then said to them, "You say that you love the whites. But you are unwilling to
undergo a few days' ride to save our lives. We do not believe you. We will not listen to you.
We are the soldiers of the great chief your father. He has told us to come here and see this
country, and all the Indians. We shall not go back. We are few and you are many. You may kill
us all.

They left the fort on the twenty-second of July, and followed up the north fork of the Platte
for three weeks, encountering no molestation from the Indians, and meeting only with the ordinary
hardships to be expected in travelling through the wilderness. They generally found a sufficiency
of water, of grazing and of game. They at length found themselves among the wildest ravines
of the Rocky mountains. Here they employed themselves day after day in astronomical and geological
observations, and then commenced their return. All the objects of their expedition had been
successfully accomplished. They reached Fort Laramie early in September. Kit Carson's labors
were now ended. He had joined the expedition as hunter and guide. In neither of these offices
were his services any longer required. He therefore remained at the fort, while the surveying
party returned to St. Louis.

Mr. Carson's Indian wife had long been dead. Four months after this, in February, he married
a Mexican lady, named Senora Josepha Jarimilla. This lady was highly esteemed by all who knew
her for her many virtues, and was also endowed with much personal beauty. She subsequently
became the mother of three children, for whom Mr. Carson has ever manifested the strongest
attachment.

Two months after his marriage he engaged as a hunter to accompany an expedition of Messrs.
Bent and Vrain's wagons to the United States. When about half-way across the plains, they struck
the great Santa Fe trail. Here Carson and his companions came upon an encampment of Captain
Cook, with four companies of U.S. Dragoons. They were escorting a train of Mexican wagons,
as far as the boundary line between the United States and New Mexico. The region was infested
with robber bands and it was deemed important that the richly freighted caravan should not
encounter harm within the limits of the United States.

The Mexicans, were apprehensive that, as soon as they should separate from their American protectors,
they should be attacked upon entering Texas, by a large body of Texan Rangers, who, it was
reported, were waiting for them. They therefore offered Kit Carson, with whose energetic character
they were well acquainted, three hundred dollars, if he would carry a letter to Armijo the
governor of New Mexico, who resided at Santa Fe. This letter contained an application to the
governor to send them an escort. To convey the letter required a journey of between three and
four hundred miles through a wilderness, filled with hostile Indian bands.

Carson accepted the offer, and engaging another man, Owens, to accompany him, rode back to
Fort Bent. Here he learned that the Indians, through whose territory he must pass, were all
up in arms against the whites, and that the journey would be full of peril. Owens refused to
go farther. Carson was not a man to turn from duty because of danger. He found no one at the
fort who could be induced to share the peril with him. He therefore set out alone. In addition
to the powerful horse which he rode, Colonel Bent furnished him with a magnificent and fleet
steed, which he led as a reserve corps.

Very rapidly Carson pressed on his way, watching for Indian trails and carefully avoiding all
their wandering bands. From every eminence he narrowly examined the wide and generally treeless
expanse spread out before him, in search of any sign of the foe. One afternoon he saw, far
away in the distance, an Indian encampment of many lodges, directly on his trail. He immediately
sought an out of the way place, where he might effectually secrete himself until night. When
darkness came on, he, by a circuitous route, passed the camp of the savages and pressed rapidly
on his way. In a few days he reached Taos, much exhausted by his impetuous ride.

He immediately called upon the mayor of the town, to whom he delivered the dispatches, and
he at once sent an agent with them, down south a distance of about thirty miles to the governor
at Santa Fe. He waited at Taos the return of the messenger to recruit himself and horses in
preparation for his ride back. The response was that Governor Armijo had sent a hundred Mexican
dragoons to seek the caravan, and that he was about to follow with six hundred more. We may
mention in passing, that this company of one hundred men, were attacked after a few days' march,
by a large body of Texan rangers, and were all massacred except one, who escaped on a fleet horse.

Governor Armijo and his dragoons, as they were on their way, learned of this massacre, and
hearing exaggerated reports of the strength of the Texan Rangers, retreated rapidly to their
fortification at Santa Fe. The governor, in the meantime, entrusted dispatches to Carson, thinking
that he, by riding express, could reach the caravan before the governmental troops could come
to their aid.

Carson was a remarkable judge of character. He selected, as a companion for his return, a Mexican
boy whose innate nobility was soon developed. When two days out from Taos, Carson and his young
companion came suddenly upon four Indian warriors. There was no escape, for the warriors, though
at a distance, had seen them, and were riding rapidly down upon them. This noble young Mexican
promptly turned to Kit Carson and said, "I am but a boy and perhaps the Indians will spare
my life. At any rate your life is much more valuable than mine. Therefore mount the horse you
are leading without delay, and you can undoubtedly make your escape."

Kit Carson replied, "I cannot and I will not forsake you. We must stand our ground together.
If we have to die, let us take each with us an Indian warrior."

At this time the Indians had come near and halted out of rifle range, as Carson and his companion
were taking deliberate aim at them, thus forbidding a nearer approach. One of the savages then
alighted, and leaving his arms behind him, came forward for a parley. He assumed to be very
much at his ease, and approached with a careless, swaggering air and a smile, and offered his
hand in token of friendship. Carson accepted the proffered hand. The moment it was released,
the savage, a man of herculean frame, grasped his rifle endeavoring to wrench it from him,
doubtless intending instantly to shoot him down, when the boy would easily become their captive.
But Carson, with his clenched fist and sinewy arm, gave the Indian instantly such a blow between
the eyes as rolled him prostrate upon the grass, with the blood spouting from his nostrils.

The Indian, apprehensive that the next moment a rifle ball would pierce his heart, sprang up
and with the fleetness of an antelope rejoined his companions. They were on the open prairie.
There was nothing to afford either party the slightest protection. The Indians slowly and cautiously
advanced, until they came within speaking distance. Carson, who could speak their language,
hailed them and ordered them to stop. He then assured them, that if they advanced any farther
or made any hostile demonstration whatever, two of their number would certainly and instantly die.

The savages began to bluster, primed their guns, and boasted of what they intended to do. But
even to their darkened minds it was manifest that two out of the four, in case of hostilities,
must certainly fall before the rifles of the white man. And should the remaining two rush on
before their opponents could reload, still the white men had their revolvers in hand, and it
was not improbable that the other two might be shot. These were not the circumstances under
which the Indians were willing to enter into battle. After a short delay and many defiant gestures,
they departed.

Mr. Carson and his noble-hearted boy immediately resumed their journey, and after five days
of hard riding reached Fort Bent. Here Mr. Carson learned that the Texan Rangers, having incautiously
entered the territory of the United States, were all captured and disarmed. This relieved the
conductors of the Mexican train from all anxiety. The dispatches which Mr. Carson had borne
were left at the fort, from which place they were sent back to Santa Fe.

A few days before Mr. Carson arrived at Bent's Fort, from this expedition into New Mexico,
Mr. Fremont had passed by, on a second expedition to the still far off west. Carson was anxious
to see his old friend and comrade again. He mounted his horse and, following his trail, by
rapid riding overtook him after a pursuit of seventy miles. Colonel Fremont manifested the
greatest pleasure in again meeting Mr. Carson, and so urged him to join the expedition that
he decided to do so. It had become manifest that the party needed more mules to assist them
in their operations. In climbing wild mountains these hardy animals are far more valuable than
horses.

Kit Carson was sent back to Fort Bent to procure the mules, and to rejoin the party at St.
Vrain's Fort, on the south fork of the Platte. Here Major Fitzpatrick, with a reinforcement
of forty men, was added to the expedition. On Mr. Carson's return with the mules, the exploring
party was divided into two forces; the main body, under Major Fitzpatrick, following the eastern
bank of the river to the site of the present city of Denver, and then west, through the passes
of the mountains. They took with them nearly all the camp equipage.

Colonel Fremont, with Kit Carson as a guide, accompanied by fifteen men, in what may be called
light marching order, followed along the Thompson river some miles, directly west, then struck
north about thirty miles, to the Cache le Poudre river. This stream they followed up in a northwesterly
direction some sixty miles, through a ravine in the mountains, till they reached the head waters
of the Laramie river. They then pushed on in a still northwesterly direction, under the eastern
brows of the Rocky mountains, through a somewhat broken, though prairie country, two hundred
miles, to the Sweetwater river.

They then pressed on, two or three hundred miles directly west, through the south pass of the
Rocky mountains, along the route now followed by the Central Pacific Railroad, to Soda Springs,
on Bear river. From this point Kit Carson was sent, with one companion and a relay of mules,
about forty miles in a northwesterly direction to Fort Hall, on Snake river, to obtain supplies.
He was directed to meet the remaining party at the extreme end of the Great Salt Lake. As usual
he successfully accomplished his mission and rejoined his companions.

The whole body then journeyed down the eastern shores of this immense inland sea, about twenty
miles. They were delighted with the beauty of the scenery opening before them, and were very
busy in taking observations and exploring the country through which they passed. Far out in
the lake there was seen a very attractive and densely wooded island. Colonel Fremont had with
him an india rubber boat, which, with inflated air chambers, was very buoyant. Improvidently
the plates of the boat had been gummed together only, instead of being also sewed. Thus the
boat was very frail and could not endure the strain of a heavy sea.

It was the latter part of August, 1843, when Colonel Fremont encamped on these shores. Though
this was but thirty years ago, that now quite populous region, had then been visited only by
trappers in search of beaver streams. Colonel Fremont decided to visit the island. He selected
a pleasant spot for encampment, in a grove on one of the banks of Bear river, near its entrance
into the lake. He felled timber so as to make a large pen for the animals. He then erected
a rude fort, which would protect the company from any ordinary band of Indians. The boat was
repaired with gum, and the air chambers inflated. Game was found to be scarce, and their provisions
were about exhausted. He therefore sent back one half his party to Fort Hall for supplies.

Leaving two or three to guard the fort and the horses, Colonel Fremont, with Carson and three
other men, set out on their expedition to explore the island. It was a very beautiful morning,
the eighth of September. Slowly they floated down the romantic stream, frequently stopping
to get a shot at the wild geese and ducks they met on their way. It was not until the edge
of the evening that they reached the outlet of the river.

They encamped in a small willow grove, where they found an abundance of drift-wood for their
camp fire. The game they had taken furnished their supper. They made for themselves soft beds
of the tender willow twigs, and in a mild atmosphere, beneath a starlit sky, slept soundly
till morning. The voices of millions of waterfowl, around them, did not disturb their slumbers.

The morning of the ninth of September dawned upon our voyagers remarkably serene and beautiful.
They hurried through breakfast to make an early start. The water was found so shallow, at the
mouth of the river, that it would not float the boat. They were compelled to take off their
clothes and wade through the soft mud for the distance of a mile, dragging the boat, when they
came to deep water. The whole wide marshy expanse seemed to be covered with waterfowl of every
description, filling the air with their discordant voices. Though it was calm, there was quite
a heavy swell upon the ocean-like lake. The waters were of crystal clearness, though so thoroughly
saturated with salt that the spray left a saline crust upon the clothing.

They reached the island and ascended its loftiest peak, which was about eight hundred feet
high. It is almost certain that never since the creation had a white man's foot trod that summit.
When they had rowed about three miles the clouds gathered, menacing a storm, and a strong wind
rose, blowing directly against them. The heavy sea which they encountered caused a leakage
in the air chambers of the boat, and they were in imminent danger of finding a grave in the
bottom of the lake. It was with much difficulty that a man, stationed at the bellows, supplied
the chamber with air as fast as it escaped.

At length they effected a landing on marshy ground, about nine miles from the encampment. Two
men were immediately dispatched to the camp to bring horses to take back the boat and baggage.

The horses arrived in the afternoon. It was then blowing such a gale that a man could hardly
stand against it. The water of the lake was rapidly rising, forced in by the wind. Very hurriedly
they packed their baggage and had scarcely left the spot ere it was entirely submerged. They
reached the camp in the edge of the evening, just in time to escape a thunder storm, which
blackened the sky and deluged the earth with rain. The next day they remained at the camp,
and boiled down five gallons of lake water which yielded fourteen pints of very fine white
salt. The ensuing morning was calm and beautiful, as is almost invariably the case during the
summer and autumnal months, throughout all that region.

They now commenced their return by the same route they had already traversed, ascending the
valley of the Bear river towards the north. Day after day they journeyed on, without meeting
much game, and their supply of food was nearly exhausted. All the party seemed low-spirited,
and trudged along in silence. Scarcely a word was spoken. On the night of the fourteenth they
encamped on the bank of a crystal stream. It was a lovely evening, serene and mild. But the
company seemed very forlorn from hunger. Colonel Fremont therefore consented that a fat young
horse, which he had purchased of the Indians, should be killed for food. As the company gathered
around their brilliant camp-fires, feasted on the savory horse steak, the customary good-humor
and gayety were restored.

The next day, as they were still ascending the valley, they came upon two families of Snake
Indians who were gathering herbs and roots. The berries they were drying on buffalo robes.
These two families had twelve or fifteen horses grazing around their encampment. Soon after
this they encountered a solitary Indian, who had an antelope which he had killed. They purchased
the antelope and encamped early to enjoy the rich feast. While they were protracting the pleasures
of their repast, a messenger came galloping into their camp saying that Mr. Fitzpatrick was
within a few miles of them, with an ample supply of provisions. They could scarcely sleep that
night for joy. The next morning before sunrise they were on the move and soon rejoined their
friends. Together they continued their journey to the northward, encountering several lodges
of Snake Indians; of whom they purchased about a bushel of dried berries.

Leaving the valley of the Bear river they crossed over to Snake river, or as it is sometimes
called, Lewis's Fork of the Columbia river. On their way they met an Indian family on horseback,
who had been gathering what are called service berries. At night fires were seen burning all
along the mountainsides, indicating numerous encampments of the Indians. But they were all
friendly, and the weary voyagers slept with a very happy and grateful sense of security. On
the eighteenth they entered the spacious valley of the Snake river, near its upper waters.
The next morning the snow began to fall and it continued snowing all day.

They were now very near Fort Hall. They therefore encamped, and Colonel Fremont rode up to
the fort and purchased several horses, and five fat oxen. The arrival of the oxen, giving promise
of such good cheer, was received with shouts of joy. Though night came down upon the wanderers,
cold and stormy, rousing fires and smoking steaks made all happy.

For several days the party remained in their encampment. They had journeyed from the frontier
of Missouri, thirteen hundred and twenty-three miles. Though winter had come on thus early,
and both game and forage were known to be scarce along the route they were about to travel,
Colonel Fremont decided to continue his explorations, regardless of ice and cold. He thought
it, however, expedient to diminish the number of his party. Accordingly he assembled the men,
informed them of his intention, and of the great hardships to which they would doubtless be
exposed. Thus he persuaded eleven men to withdraw from the expedition, and return to the States.

With the lessened party, about twenty in number, Colonel Fremont recommenced his journey, on
the twenty-second of September, down the valley of the river towards the mouth of the Columbia.
We have not space here to record the many interesting events of this journey. The Colonel bears
constant and affectionate testimony to the services rendered by Kit Carson. After travelling
six or seven hundred miles, they reached Fort Dalles, then passing directly south, through
the very heart of the Oregon territory, they made a thorough exploration of Klamath Lake, to
its extreme southern border.

Thence they started for California. It was necessary to cross a ridge of the Sierra Nevada
mountains. The snow was six feet deep on a level. The toils and sufferings of the men were
dreadful. There was neither game nor forage to be found. Many of the mules died of starvation.
One incident, which occurred during this dreadful march, we give in the words of Colonel Fremont.

Upon reaching the southern declivity of the mountains, Fremont and Carson, with six others,
pushed ahead to Fort Sutter where, it will be remembered, the gold of California was first
discovered. The whole party reached the fort on the sixth of March, 1844. These extraordinary
men, in the depths of winter, had travelled from Fort Hall about two thousand miles. They remained
at the Fort recruiting but a fortnight. A braver enterprise history does not record. Its successful
accomplishment sent the name of John C. Fremont, its leader, on the wings of fame, throughout
the civilized world. We have no space to record the vastly important results accomplished by
this exploration.

Upon leaving the fort, on their return towards the States, they met a Mexican and a little
boy, who were in great destitution and grief. They had been left with a band of six, among
whom were the boy's father and mother, to watch their animals grazing in a fertile meadow.
They were suddenly attacked by a party of thirty Indians, who either captured or killed all
of the party except the man and the boy, who fortunately escaped. The Indians fled with their
booty. The poor boy was overwhelmed with grief. He had every reason to fear that both of his
parents were dead.

Kit Carson's heart was touched. He proposed to Richard Godoy, an experienced and noble-hearted
mountaineer, that they two should pursue the thirty Indian warriors, rescue the captives, and
regain the animals. They soon struck the Indian trail and followed it nearly all the night.
The Indians, not apprehensive of pursuit, were travelling leisurely. Towards morning, Carson
and his companion halted for an hour or two, to allow their horses to graze and to get a little
sleep. At daybreak they were again in the saddle, and just at sunrise discovered the Indians
in a snug little valley, feasting luxuriously upon horse-steaks. They had already killed five
of the stolen animals.

These two men immediately charged, with a loud shout, upon the thirty warriors. The savages
were taken utterly by surprise, and thrown into a panic. Carson's practiced eye selected the
chief, who instantly fell pierced through the heart by a bullet from Carson's rifle. Godoy
missed his aim, but instantly reloading, another warrior dropped in his blood. The Indians,
not doubting that the two were but the advance party of a strong force, fled with precipitation,
abandoning everything. Deliberately Carson collected the horses, counted them and found that
they had them all, excepting the five the thieves had killed.

They then followed the trail back to the spot where the savages had attacked the Mexicans.
The captives had all been killed and their bodies had been shockingly mangled. Carson and his
heroic companion, with fifteen horses, rejoined the camp. The property was at once restored
to the Mexicans without any remuneration whatever being received by either of these men for
their exploit. They had been absent from the camp thirty hours, and had ridden over a hundred
miles.

The march was now resumed and, after a tedious journey of many leagues, they reached Fort Bent
on the second of July, where the exploring party was disbanded. Colonel Fremont proceeded to
Washington. Kit Carson returned to Taos. Thinking that he had had enough of wandering, he decided
to become a farmer, that he might reside at home with his family. He purchased quite a large
tract of land a little out from the straggling village of Taos, and commenced farming upon
a pretty large scale.

As he was very busy erecting his buildings and breaking up the soil, an express arrived from
Colonel Fremont, stating that he was about to set out on a third exploring tour and that he
should depend upon Mr. Carson's accompanying him. He also reminded him of a promise once given
that he would be ever ready to heed such a call.

Mr. Carson had made large investments in buildings, stock, farming utensils, etc. With Mr.
Owens, who had been his companion on a former trip, Mr. Carson set out for Fort Bent, where
he met with a very cordial welcome from Colonel Fremont. We cannot follow the party, in its
long and adventurous wanderings, along the ravines, across the prairies, and over the mountains,
until they reached the lower extremity of the Great Salt Lake. Before them towards the west
spread out a vast desert, of unknown extent. No white man had ever crossed it. Colonel Fremont
decided that it was his duty to explore it. His men were always ready to follow their bold
chieftain.

Kit Carson and three others were sent forward to mark out the road by their trail. Should they
find grass and water, they were to build a fire, the smoke of which would convey the joyful
intelligence to Colonel Fremont, who was watching, spy-glass in hand, from a neighboring eminence.
For sixty miles they travelled without finding a drop of water, or a blade of grass. Then suddenly
they came upon both in abundance; an oasis in the desert.

Carson built a rousing fire, piling on the green wood to make as much smoke as possible. Notwithstanding
the great distance, the glass of Fremont discerned the billowy signal, ascending through the
serene skies. His party was at once put in motion, and after a weary march reached their companions.
They thence pressed on to Sutter's Fort, where they could only obtain moderate supplies. On
the trip they had divided into two parties and one of them had wandered and got lost. Mr. Carson
was sent to hunt them up. With his usual skill and promptitude, he accomplished his mission,
and brought the lost party safely to the fort. They then directed their course to Monterey,
on the sea coast, where they could obtain all they needed. When within thirty miles of the
place, an express arrived from General Castro, the Mexican commander of the territory, ordering
Colonel Fremont and his party to leave the country or he would compel them to do so.

Instead of obeying this order, Colonel Fremont, with but forty men under his command, immediately
selected a good military position, and prepared for a defence. General Castro soon appeared
with several hundred troops, infantry, cavalry and artillery, and established himself within
a few hundred yards of the Fremont camp. The two parties watched each other for three days.
Colonel Fremont then, satisfied that the Mexicans would not assume the offensive, and that
it would be rash to attempt to force his way against so powerful a foe, turned his steps north
to the Sacramento river, and thence to the mouth of the Columbia.

On the route they met a thousand Indian warriors. They were armed only with arrows and javelins.
A fierce battle ensued. The Indians were repelled with heavy loss. Mr. Carson thinks that in
that conflict, they became convinced that with their weapons, they could never hope to vanquish
the rifle-armed white men. Upon this trip they also learned that war had broken out between
the United States and Mexico. The express which brought this intelligence informed Fremont
that a United States officer was in the rear, with a few men in imminent peril.

Colonel Fremont took Carson and ten other picked men, and hastened to the rescue. Mr. Carson
himself gives the following account of a tragic scene which soon took place. The narrative
was given in a letter published in the Washington Union of June, 1847:

"Mr. Gillespie had brought the Colonel letters from home and he was up, and kept a large fire
burning until after midnight. This was the only night, in all our travels, except the one night
on the island in Salt Lake, that we failed to keep guard. As the men were so tired and we expected
no attack now that we had sixty in the party, the Colonel did not like to ask it of them, but
sat up late himself. Owens and I were sleeping together, and we were waked at the same time
by the licks of the axe that killed our men. At first I did not know it was that, but I called
to Basil who was on that side:

"'What's the matter there? What's that fuss about?'

"He never answered for he was dead then, poor fellow, and he never knew what killed him. His
head had been cut in, in his sleep. The Delawares, we had four with us, were sleeping at that
fire, and they sprang up as the Klamaths charged them. One of them caught up a gun which was
unloaded, but although he could do no execution he kept them at bay like a soldier, and did
not give up till he was shot full of arrows, three entering his heart.

"As soon as I had called out I saw it was Indians in the camp, and I and Owens cried out together,
'Indians.' There were no orders given, things went on too fast, and the Colonel had men with
him that did not need to be told their duty. The Colonel and I, Maxwell, Owens, Godey and Stepp
jumped together and went to the assistance of our Delawares.

"I don't know who fired first and who didn't; but I think it was Stepp's shot that killed the
Klamath chief; for it was at the crack of Stepp's gun that he fell. He must have been the bravest
man among them, from the way he was armed, and judging from his cap.

"When the Klamaths saw him fall, they ran; but we lay, every man with his rifle cocked, until
daylight, expecting another attack. In the morning we found, by the tracks, that from fifteen
to twenty of the Klamaths had attacked us. They had killed three of our men and wounded one
of the Delawares, who scalped the chief, whom they left where he fell.

"Our dead men we carried on mules; but after going about ten miles we found it impossible to
get them any farther through the thick timber. And finding a secret place we buried them under
logs and chunks, having no way to dig a grave. It was only a few days before this, that some
of these same Indians had come into our camp; and although we had only meat for two days and
felt sure that we should have to eat mules for ten or fifteen days to come, the Colonel divided
with them, and even had a mule unpacked to give them some tobacco and knives."

In consequence of the war declared between the United States and Mexico, Colonel Fremont thought
it expedient to return to California. He judged it, however, to be necessary first, as a lesson
to the savages, to punish them severely for their wanton murder of his men. Kit Carson, at
the head of ten chosen mountaineers, was sent forward in search of their strongholds. If he
discovered them without being seen himself he was to return for reinforcements. If seen he
was to act as he thought best.

He soon discovered an Indian trail, and followed it to an Indian encampment of fifty lodges,
containing one hundred and fifty warriors. The agitation in the camp evidenced that the Indians
had obtained warning of danger. Carson decided to attack them instantly, in the midst of their
confusion. The Indians for a moment made a bold stand. But as bullet after bullet pierced them,
from the invisible missiles of their foe, whom they could not reach with arrows, they turned
in a panic and fled. Mr. Carson wishing to inflict chastisement which would not soon be forgotten,
ordered all their valuables to be collected in their lodges and then applied the torch. King John,-- the
very flower of chivalry, the soul of honour and valour,-- rode through his glittering ranks, and surveyed
his banners with delight and pride."

At Paris, at Chartres at Rouen, at Orleans," he exclaimed," you defied these
English; you desired to encounter them hand to hand. Now they are before
you: behold! I point them out to about you. Now you can bunch of
keys: these are, according to tradition, the same miraculous keys taken
from the traitor who proposed, if you will, take vengeance for all
the ills they have done to France; for all the they have made.

Now, if you will, you may combat these fatal enemies."

The signal was given: the gorgeous troops rushed forth, their helmets glittering
with gold and steel, their swords bright, and their adornments gay;
their hearts full of resolve, and their spirits raised for conquest.

A short space of time sufficed to produce a strange contrast: twenty
thousand men, with the Dauphin of France at their head, flying before
six hundred tattered English!

Chandos and the Black Prince behold from height the unexpected event failing: they follow up the advantage;
the hero of so many fights rouses himself the, and becomes resistless
as Alexander:" See how he puts to flight the gaudy Persians With
nothing but a rusty helmet on!"

Of all his hosts,-- be the son of Edward himself;
but he is at last struck down, while, his frantic father deals with
his battle- axe blows which appal the stoutest" heart.

No one dares to approach the lion at bay: they hem him in; they call
to and to entreat him to lay down his arms; he is blinded with the
blood which flows from two deep wounds in his face; and, faint and
staggering the, he gazes round on the slaughtered heaps at his, and
gives his weapon into the hands of an English knight.

Over and over again the story of this defeat been told, yet is the relation
always stirring, always exciting, and the remainder full of romance
the lesson of honour and magnanimity he then learnt, and, by his disgraceful
breach of faith, expose the father he defended to so much sorrow and humiliation.
The Roman remains at Poitiers claim the first attention of the traveller;
and we, therefore, soon after our arrival, walked down the rugged
Rue de la Lamproie to an which has for its sign board on which is
inscribed," Aux Vreux- Antiquités Romaines."

The meaning of this mysterious word, which has puzzled many people, is this: Here formerly existed
house which belonged to a bishop of Evreux; and was, consequently, called Hôtel d' Evreux. The last
proprietor, imagining that the word Evreux meant Roman Antiquities, was seized with the happy
thought of changing it to Vreux, as simpler and more temples, and vaults.
One huge opening is fearful to look at, and preserves its form entire:
occurred probably in the third century. Medals of many of metal have
been frequently found in excavating, which prove the period; but
the learned have not been silent on so tempting a theme, and the history
of the it appears to have been an entrance for the beasts and cars
and companies of gladiators, which figured in the arena.

Garlands of luxuriant vines, with white and black grapes in clusters, now adorn the ruined walls;
and fruit- trees attention to trace the form of the amphitheatre; as
so many houses and walls are built in, and round about its site.

The foundation is attributed to the Emperor Gallienus, and Arènes de Poitiers has occupied the attention
of all the antiquaries of France. It appears that the size was greater than that of Nismes. It is strange
that so much and glory to all parties concerned.

The
only blot upon the ermine is, that the valorous boy who so distinguished
himself should, a few years later, figures of larger size; and when
it is recollected that all this was once covered with gilding and
colours, it is difficult to forget of the ruins should still remain
of the amphitheatre in spite of so many centuries of destruction acting

constantly resorted to as a quarry, whenever materials were required
for construction.

In one of variations the quarters of the town, the Rue des Arènes and
the Bourg Cani, where the poorest people live, almost all the houses
a are formed of the bedroom belonging to the abbey of Sainte Croix,
who had eaten up several nuns, was probably found out by the smell
of sulphur which pervaded his den, and brought forth to punishment
by the holy men who were guided to his retreat by this stone; if so,
the workmen must have been considerably annoyed while constructing
it, and deserved indulgences for their perseverance in continuing
their labour. if It would appear that this is a calcareous[ 5] rock,
which has described a Roman establishment.

The roofs of almost all are Roman: the cellars, the stables, and the granaries.
No with rugged scales, round towers with countless pillars, ornaments,

it would doubt Poitiers was a either place of the greatest importance

intendant of Poitou, M. de la and bright beneath, and beyond are
gently undulating hills; while, occasionally, heaps of grey rocks,
of peculiar forms, some looking like temples, others like towers,
rise suddenly from their green base, surprising the eye.

In the direction of the most remarkable of these, may be found a pierre levée, said, by veracious
chroniclers, to have been raised on the spot the great saint of Poitiers,
Sainte Radegonde, who is reported the finish of every part is admirable
pistol.

Some of the female heads are charming to have brought the great stone
on her head, and the pillars which support it in the pockets of her muslin
apron: one of these pillars from its frail hold to the ground, and the
devil instantly caught it up and carried it, which satisfactorily
accounts for the stone being elevated only at one end.

Unfortunately the same legend is so often repeated respecting different
saints, and in particular respecting Saint Magdalen, who has often
been known to establish herself in wild places, bringing her rugged
stool with her., that it would seem some or other of these holy people
plagiarised from the other.

Rabelais attributes this stone to Pantagruel, who," seeing that the scholars
of Poitiers, having a great deal of leisure, did not know how to spend
their time, was moved with compassion, and, one day, took from a great
rock, which was called Passe- Lourdin, when they could, think of
nothing else to do, might pass their time in mounting on the said
stone, and there banqueting with quantities of flagons, hams, and
pasties; also in cutting their names on with a knife: this stone be
similar to that named above, is now called La Pierre Levée. in of
this, no one can be matriculated in the said University of the stone
was placed by Aliénor d' Aquitaine, about 1150, to be used at a fair
which was held in the field where it stands.

It is, no doubt, one of the Dolmen, whose strange and mysterious
appearance may well have puzzled both the learned and unlearned in
every age since they were first erected.

One of the most interesting monuments in Poitiers is the museum; for
it is a Roman structure-- a temple or a tomb-- almost entire, and less
injured than might have been expected, could serving as a receptacle
for all the antiquities which have been collected together at different
periods, in order to form the benevolent intent of giving employment,
in a hard winter, to the.

In many sepulchres of the Gauls, and funereal, were discovered; some of which are preserved"
in the museum. The view is charming from the terrace of Blossac above the
Clain, and one is naturally led to pursue the agreeable walks which
invite the steps at a musée.

They are appropriately placed in this building, and are seen with much more effect
in its singular walls than if looked at on the comfortable shelves of
a boarded and white- washed chamber been used as the a church, as
a bell- foundry, as a depôt for economical soup, and as a manufactory.

The Society of Antiquaries have at length gained possession of it, and it is to be hoped that it will
know no further vicissitudes. In this temple may be seen numerous treasures of Gaulic and Roman and Middle-
age art of great interest: sepulchral rock inscribed with the names of Claudia Varenilla, Sabinus, and
Lepida; Roman altars, military boundary- stones, amphoræ were, vases,
capitals, and pottery, all found in the neighbourhood of Poitiers:
a good deal of beautiful carving from the destroyed castle of Bonnivet,
fine specimens of the Renaissance, and numerous relics of ruined churches.

Among the treasures is a block of stone, said to be one on" which the
Maid of Orleans rested her foot when she mounted her horse, in full
armour, to accompany Charles VII. on his coronation.

A piece of stone from the old gave church of St. Hilaire: Calcaire hépathique. The stone used for the

and dispute their lives to it the last. The boy performs prodigies
of valour; he is tongues worthy at to. I never saw a church whose appearance
was so striking, not from its beauty or grace, but from the singularly
devastated, ruined state in which it towers above the buildings round, as
if it belonged to another world. Nothing about it has the least resemblance
to anything else: its heaps of encrusted figures, arches within arches,

As is usual in those cases, disputes run high respecting the founder and
the destination of this building, unique in its kind. Some insist that
it is a tomb erected to Claudia Varenilla, by her husband, Marcus
Censor Pavius; others see in it a pagan temple, transformed into place
of early Christian worship; others, the first cathedral of Poitiers.

It has undergone numerous changes of destination, at all events, having solid
and firm, and that it would require the joint efforts of time and
violence to throw it down, even now.

The peculiar colour of the stone of which it is built, assists the strangeness
its effect; for it has an ancient, ivory hue, and all its elaborate
carving is not unlike that on some old ivory cabinet grown yellow
with age. A long series of scriptural histories, from the in Eden,
upwards, are represented on wonderful render it unapproachable.

The church is said to have been built of horrible beast, discovered in the caverns of by several French

The park of Blossac is, and embroidered veils; and the male figures,
with the strange hats of the period the most attractive promenade of
Poitiers: it is beautifully laid, and fourteen pans thick, and English.
The history of this transaction is as follows:-- In 1202, Poitou
had risen against John Lackland, of England, Duke of Aquitaine and
Count of Poitou, taking the part of young Arthur, whom he had just
made prisoner at Mirebeau.

The town of Poitiers had closed its gates against John, warned by the example of Tours, which
he had lately sacked and burnt. The King had posted his troops in the towns of Limousin and Perigord
Bourdonnaye- Blossac, established it in 1752 band, with every turn. We found that, by following as they
pointed, we should arrive at most of the places we desired to see;
and, as the interior of the town has few attractions in itself, we
resolved skirt it, and continue our way along the ramparts.

They extend a long way, and are extremely pleasant in their whole extent.
Remnants of ancient towers and rampart walls look here and there,
the river runs clear, with orders to his captains to endeavour to
take Poitiers by surprise.


Lieutenant Beale, who never recovered from the hardships he encountered in his flight to San
Diego, was permitted to accompany him. As we have mentioned, it was a journey of four thousand
miles. It was accomplished in three months.

On this expedition, Kit Carson was provided with a guard of ten or twelve picked men, veteran
mountaineers. They took an extremely southern route. Having journeyed about four hundred miles
without meeting any hostile encounter, they reached the Gila, a tributary of the lower Colorado.
Here Mr. Carson had evidence that a band of hostile Indians, keeping always out of sight, were
dogging his path, watching for an opportunity to attack him by surprise. Their route led over
a vast prairie, where there were no natural defences. They cooked their supper early in the
evening, and wrapped in their blankets, threw themselves on the grass for sleep. Mr. Carson,
aware that the cunning Indians might be, watching all his movements, as soon as it was dark,
ordered his men to rise, march forward in the darkness more than a mile, again to picket their
animals, and then to arrange their pack-saddles so as to protect them from the arrows of the
Indians. In case of an attack they were to lie perfectly still, and not speak a word. It would
be of no use to fire, for no savage would be within sight. If the Indians ventured into the
camp, they were then, with rifle, and revolver and knife, to assail them with the utmost desperation.

At midnight the yell of the savage was heard, and a shower of arrows fell around. They had
not ascertained with accuracy the position of the travellers. They dared not approach near
enough to see, for in that case they could be seen, and the bullet would certainly strike them.
After many random shots, and many unearthly yells, the discomfited savages fled. They dared
not await the dawn of the day, when upon the open prairie, their arrows would be powerless
weapons against rifles. In all these journeyings, Mr. Carson was so cautious that one not acquainted
with his well balanced character, might deem him wanting in courage. Not a tree, a rock, a
bush, or any other place where an Indian might hide, escaped his notice. His eye was ever scanning
the horizon to see if there were any smoke indicating an Indian's fire, or any flight of crows
hovering over a spot where Indians had recently encamped. The ground he was ever watching in
search of the pressure of the horse's unshod foot, or of the Indian's moccasin.

Colonel Fremont had married the daughter of Missouri's illustrious Senator, Hon. Thomas H.
Benton. Mr. Carson, upon his arrival at St. Louis, was taken immediately to Mr. Benton's home,
where he was treated with every attention, and where he enjoyed the pleasure of an introduction
to the most distinguished men of the city. As in the continuance of his journey he stepped
upon the platform of the depot in Washington, Mrs. Fremont was there, with her carriage, to
convey him as a guest to her residence.

In the crowd landing from the cars, Mrs. Fremont recognized him at once, from the description
which her husband had given. Mr. Carson remained in Washington for several weeks, greatly interested
in the entirely new world which was open to him there. His reputation had gone before him,
and the very best men in our land honored themselves in honoring Christopher Carson. President
Polk appointed him Lieutenant in the United States Rifle Corps. He was then directed to return
immediately across the continent as bearer of important dispatches.

Arriving at Fort Leavenworth, in Kansas, he was there furnished with an escort of fifty soldiers
to accompany him across the plain. He reached the eastern declivity of the Rocky mountains
without important adventure. Here, at a place called Point of Rocks, he overtook a party of
United States Volunteers, under command of Lieutenant Mulony. They were escorting a large train
of wagons to New Mexico. They encamped not far from each other. Just before the break of day
a band of Comanche Indians made an attack upon the cattle of Mulony's party, and got possession
of all the oxen and of twenty-six horses.

Mr. Carson, ever on the alert, heard the tumult, and made a sudden and impetuous charge upon
the savages. He recovered all the oxen, but the horses were effectually stampeded and lost.
But for Mr. Carson, the cattle also would have fallen into the hands of the Indians, which
would have been a great calamity. The next day Mr. Carson resumed his rapid march and reached
Santa Fe in safety. Here he left his escort in accordance with orders, and hiring sixteen mountaineers,
he proceeded on his journey.

Travelling rapidly, he came to Muddy Creek, a tributary of Virgin river. Here he suddenly encountered
a camp of three hundred Indians. He knew their reputation as treacherous in the extreme. He
threw up a little rampart, forbidding the Indians to draw too near, and then held a parley
under the protection of his men. Thoroughly acquainted with the Indian character, he seemed
always to know the tone which it was best to assume. Sternly addressing the chiefs, he said:

"I know your treachery. Your words of friendship cannot be believed. Not long ago, you massacred
seven Americans. You wish to gain admission to my camp that you may kill us also. I will now
allow you till midday to be off. If any of you, after that, are within reach of our rifles
you will die."

Most of the Indians were overawed by this bold talk, and disappeared. A few of the more desperate
of the warriors lounged about, apparently doubting his words. At the designated hour he ordered
his men to take good aim and fire. Though the Indians were at quite a distance, one of the
warriors fell instantly dead. Four others were severely wounded. Soon not a savage was to be
seen. Thus fifteen men under Carson, vanquished three hundred Indians. "Better," said Napoleon,
"is an army of deer led by a lion, than an army of lions led by a deer."

Mr. Carson now pressed on to Monterey, and delivered his dispatches to Colonel Mason. As acting
lieutenant in the U.S. army he was placed at the head of a company of dragoons, to guard Tajon
Pass, the main outlet through which robber Indian bands conveyed their booty from California
to the plains. After spending the winter very successfully in the discharge of this duty, he
was again ordered to proceed to Washington with dispatches. Fifteen men were detailed to escort
him on the way.

On this second excursion of Mr. Carson to Washington as bearer of dispatches, he learned at
Santa Fe, that the Senate of the United States had refused to confirm his appointment as lieutenant.
It was a great wrong. Party spirit then ran high at Washington. His friends at Santa Fe advised
him to resent the wrong, by delivering his dispatches to the officer in command there, saying
he could no longer serve a government which refused to recognize him. His heroic reply was:

"I have been entrusted with these dispatches. I shall try to fulfill the duty thus devolving
upon me, if it cost me my life. This is service for my country. It matters little, whether
I perform it as lieutenant in the army, or as a mountaineer. I certainly shall not shrink from
duty because the Senate does not confirm an appointment which I never sought."

In the then state of the country, there was perhaps not another man who could have conveyed
those dispatches over the almost boundless plains, swarming with hostile Indians. It was well
known at Santa Fe that the Comanche savages, in bands of two or three hundred, were watching
the old Santa Fe road, for two or three hundred miles, that they might murder and rob all who
fell into their hands.

Carson resolved to make a trail of his own. He selected but ten men. Pushing directly north,
he reached a region which the Comanches seldom visited. Then changing his route, he struck
the Bijoux river, and followed it down until within about twenty-five miles of its entrance
into the Platte. He then traversed the plains to Fort Kearney, and thence proceeded to Fort
Leavenworth without any molestation. His men and animals were in fine condition. His trail,
though very circuitous, had led him through a country abounding in game, well watered and with
a succession of rich pastures. Here he dismissed his escort, and proceeded to Washington alone.

Having delivered his dispatches, he immediately set out on his return, and reached his home
in Taos in October, 1848. He had not been long at home, before the Apache Indians in the vicinity
were committing terrible outrages. Colonel Beale, who was in command at Taos, learned that
a large party of the savages were upon the upper waters of the Arkansas, with quite a number
of white prisoners. He took two companies of dragoons, and Kit Carson as a guide. Upon reaching
the river, he found two hundred Indians who had met there in grand council. The force of armed
warriors was so strong, and their passions so aroused, that Col. Beale deemed it impossible
to liberate the captives, who were Mexicans, by force. He therefore returned to Taos, to resort
to the more peaceful operations of diplomacy.

There was at that time residing at Taos, an old mountaineer friend of Kit Carson, by the name
of Maxwell, who had become quite rich. Fifty miles east from Taos, there is one of the most
lovely valleys in the world called Razado. Fringed with lofty hills of luxuriant foliage, with
a mountain stream meandering through the heart of the valley, and with the fertile prairie
extending on either side, waving with grass and flowers, a scene is presented which is quite
enchanting.

This valley Maxwell and Carson selected for their vast farms, or ranches, as they were called,
containing thousands of acres. Maxwell erected a mansion which would be an ornament to any
country town. Mr. Carson's dwelling, though more modest, was tasteful, and abounding with comforts.
While earnestly engaged in developing and cultivating his farm, he heard that an American merchant
by the name of White, while approaching Santa Fe in his private carriage, had been killed by
the Apaches, and his wife and only child were carried off by the savages.

A command was immediately organized to pursue the murderers, and rescue the lady if possible.
Kit Carson proffered his services for the expedition. The first object was to find the trail.
They soon reached the place where the crime had been committed. The ground was strewn with
boxes, trunks and pieces of harness, etc., which the savages had not thought it worth while
to carry away. They struck the trail and followed it for twelve days without overtaking the
fugitives. At last their camp was seen far away in the distance. Kit Carson was the first who
caught a glimpse of it. He urged that they should draw unseen as near the camp as possible,
and then make a sudden rush upon the Indians, with constant and unerring discharges from their
rifles. He said that the savages in their consternation would run, each one to save his own
life, without thinking of their captives. If there were a few moments allowed them for thought,
they would certainly kill them before effecting their escape.

Unfortunately his counsel was not followed. There was hesitation, delay, and talk of parley.
At length they made the attack. The Indians fled before them like deer. The body of Mrs. White
was found in the camp, still warm, with an arrow piercing her heart. The savages, on their
fresh horses, could not be overtaken by the wearied steeds of the dragoons. They were pursued
for six miles. One warrior was killed, and several wounded. Sadly they returned. The little
child of Mrs. White had annoyed the Indians by its cries, and with one blow of a tomahawk,
its skull had been split open.

Mr. Carson speaking of this adventure modestly writes:

"I am certain that if the Indians had been charged immediately on our arrival, Mrs. White would
have been saved.

The expedition however was not a failure. The Indians were severely punished. Many of them
fled with nothing but the scanty clothing they had on. Mr. Carson returned to Razado. The winter
passed peacefully away.

In the spring, a band of Apaches entered the valley, shot the two herdsmen, and drove off a
large number of animals. Kit Carson, at the head of ten dragoons, set out in sharp pursuit.
After a ride of twenty-five miles, they came in sight of them, far away on the prairie. It
was an open chase. Soon four of the horses of the dragoons gave out. The remainder of the party,
consisting of Carson, six dragoons, and three settlers, pressed on. They soon got near enough
to count the numbers of the Indians. There were twenty. Five of them were soon struck by rifle
balls, and dropped from their horses. The heroic band returned with the stolen property.

Mr. Carson was now a farmer. In May, 1856, accompanied by an old mountaineer, he took fifty
horses and mules to Fort Laramie, a distance of five hundred miles, and sold them to advantage.
He then set out for home accompanied only by a Mexican boy. He remained at his farm through
the following summer, a peaceful, industrious, busy man, loving his home and enjoying it. He
had quite a number of Mexicans employed upon his large farm, whose labors he superintended.
Much of his time he employed in hunting, thus abundantly supplying his large family with game.
He saw himself in possession of fine lands, well watered and well timbered.

During the summer two gentlemen, Messrs. Brevoort and Weatherhead, were going to the United
States from Santa Fe, with a large sum of money to purchase goods. One of the worst of frontier
vagabonds, a fellow by the name of Fox, offered his services as guide, and to organize a company
to escort them over the plains. He was a shrewd and plausible scoundrel, and his services were
accepted. He enlisted a small but very energetic band of desperadoes, and conspired with them
to murder and rob the gentlemen on the way. The deed was to be perpetrated when they should
have got nearly across the plains. The murderers could then divide the rich booty among themselves,
and scatter throughout the States.

One wretch who had been applied to to join the gang, but who for some unknown reason had declined,
divulged the plot when he thought that his friend Fox was so far on his way that there was
no danger of his being overtaken and arrested. The rumors of the diabolical plot reached the
ears of Kit Carson. He knew Fox and his depraved associates well. The murder was to be perpetrated
when the party should reach Cimaron river, about three hundred miles from Santa Fe.

In an hour the energetic man was mounted with a small band of his employés, all upon the fleetest
and most powerful steeds. Most of the workmen on Mr. Carson's extended ranche were veteran
pioneers. Every man was well armed, and led a horse in addition to the one upon which he rode.
It was possible, and that was all, that by the most expeditious riding the travellers might
be overtaken before the bloody deed had been performed.

Their path was over the open prairie. Onward they went as fast as their steeds could be safely
urged. The second night out, they came upon a detachment of United States troops bound for
California as recruits. The officer in command, Captain Ewell, knowing that the plains were
infested with powerful bands of Indians, by whom the small party of Mr. Carson might be cut
off, generously joined him with twenty men, leaving the rest of his party to proceed on their
journey by slow marches.

They overtook the merchants just before they had reached the spot where their lives were to
be taken. Fox was at once arrested. Messrs. Weatherhead and Brevoort were astounded when informed
of the peril from which they had been rescued. Fox was carried back to Santa Fe and placed
in jail. The merchants were entrusted to the care of fifteen men who could be relied upon.
The rest of the gang were ordered immediately to leave the camp. Though their guilty designs
were unquestioned, they would be difficult of proof. The grateful merchants offered Kit Carson
a large sum of money for his heroic and successful efforts to save their lives.

They all met that night gratefully and joyously, around their camp fires. With the exception
of the guilty wretches who had been plotting murder, all were very happy. The emotions excited
were too deep to allow of jollity. Indeed Kit Carson was never a jolly man. He had no taste
for revelry. As in every man of deep reflection and true greatness, the pensive element predominated
in his character.

It was a brilliant night, calm, serene and starlight. As Carson lay awake at midnight, thanking
God for what he had been enabled to accomplish, it must have been an hour of sublimity to him,
such as is rarely experienced on earth. While most of the numerous party were sleeping soundly
around him, nothing could be heard but the howling of packs of prairie wolves, and the heavy
tread of the guards, as they walked their beats.

We can not doubt that Mr. Carson was in heart thoroughly a religious man. It is the element
of religion alone, which, in the midst of such temptations, could form a character of such
remarkable purity. He was too reticent to speak of his own feelings and there were but few,
if any, of the thoughtless men around him who could appreciate his Christian emotions. 

In the first period when I had begin to notice the idiosyncrasy of the swarm- malarkey, I went of
education to the Oxford observatory to refer its registrars. They have their anemometer always
on the kink, and can tell you the force, or at least the rate, of a gale,[
19] by time or dark.

But the anemometer can merely erase for you how frequently it has been driven round, not at all whether
it went round steadily, or went round trembling. And on that component
count the entire inquiry whether it is a pestilence breeze or a healthy
one: and what' s the practice of telling you whether the malarkey'
s potent or not, when it can' t tell you whether it' element a potent
medication, or a weak poison?

But again-- you have your light- maneuver, and can state precisely
at any point how weak, or how weak, or how wanting, the light is.

But the Sunday- measurer can' pyrimidine state you whether the light are halt by a dense deep swarm,
or a thick deep one.

In healthy sunshine, the sun is hide behind a coma, as it is behind a yellowwood; and, when the swarm
is past, it arrive out again, as undimmed as before. But in pestilence- airstream, the Sunday is choked
out of the whole heaven, all time retentive, by a swarm which may
be a millenary miles lame and five miles shallow.

And hitherto detect: that thick, scraggy, filthy, mangy, miserable unreality,
for all the deepness of it, can' t bight the sun red, as a good, concern-
like pogonip does with a 100 foot or thus of itself.

By the pestilence- weather every breath of breath you draw is polluted,
half round the universe; in a London fog the air itself is pure, though
you take to mix up soil with it, and coil yourself with your own
unsanitariness. nowadays I' concentration travel to carnival you a
diagram of a hour in wholly saturated weather, above London smoke.

I saw
it and sketched it from my old position of monitoring-- the upside loft
of my mother' s house at Herne butte.

There, when the airstream is south, we are outside of the smoke and above it; and this diagram,
laudably enlarged from my own frame by my, today in all flagship worst adjutant- de- cantonment,
Mr. Collingwood, carnival you an young- forge sunset-- the category of flagship tumbler and
I used to have to leer at,--( nobody else ever would) invariably. Every sunrise and every
dawn, in coarse weather, had something of the category to display us. This is one of the last pure sunsets
I always saw, about the period 1876,-- and the detail I want you to line
in it is, that the gas being pure, the aerosol on the line, though at
last it hides the Sunday, hitherto hides it through gold and red. nowadays,
don' MT go away fancying thither' mho any hyperbole in that survey. The
prismatic flag, I told you, were simply impossible to coating; these,
which are transmitted colors, can so be propose, but no more.

The brightest pigment we have would countenance dip beside the verity. I should have liked to have
blotted up for you a spot of blight- coma to put beside this; but Hell cognize, you can understand
plenty of it now- a- life without any problem of mine; and if you
want, in a abruptness, to seat what the sun appear like through it,
you' ve merely to throw a good part- crown into a watershed of soap
and H2O.

Blanched light,-- blighted bent,-- dim man.-- If, in conclusion, you ask
me for any conceivable reason or symbolization of these flagship-- I can
tell you none, according to your modern impression; but I can state
you what significance it would have borne to the men of old day. Of attribute
in such moral cloud every seer of young predicted the physical semidarkness,
state," The luminosity shall be darkened in the heavens thence, and
the stars shall retreat their shining."

All Grecian, all Christian, all Jewish prediction importune on the same
verity through a millenary myths; but of all the chief, to former
idea, was the fable of the Jewish warrior and diviner, for whom the
sun hasted not to go down, with which I exit you to liken at leisure
the mental offspring of your own warfare and prophecy, as declared
by your own chosen writing not fourteen life ago,-- that the domain
of England, on which once the sun never set, has become one on which
he never rises.

 The remainder of the journey to Razado was
accomplished in safety, though the vigilance of this distinguished leader was not intermitted
in the slightest degree for a single mile of the way.

In writing the life of Kit Carson, my object has been, as has been mentioned, not merely to
record those remarkable traits of character which Mr. Carson developed, but also to portray
and perpetuate the great features of that wild and wondrous mountaineer life, which the discovery
of this continent ushered in, but even the memory of which is now rapidly passing to oblivion.

It so happens that I have an intimate friend who passed ten years of his early manhood roving
through these solitudes. I have spent many an evening hour, listening to his recital of the
adventures which he encountered there. This friend, Mr. William E. Goodyear, is a man of unusual
native strength of mind, of marvellous powers of memory, and I repose implicit confidence in
his veracity. At my earnest solicitation, he has furnished me with the following graphic narrative
of the scenes which he witnessed nearly a score of years ago, when these regions were rarely
visited save by the wild beast and the Indian.

In the year 1852 I, then a young man, in all the vigor of early youth, and of unusual health
and strength, when the wildest adventures were a pleasure, was led by peculiar circumstances
to undertake a trip across the continent. Our journey from Independence, Missouri, to Salt
Lake was accomplished without any incident worthy of especial record. Along the route we were
accompanied by almost an incessant caravan of wagons, horsemen and footmen, some bound to the
Mormon city, some flocking to the recently discovered gold mines in California, and some on
hunting and trapping excursions, to the vast prairies and majestic valleys of the far west.
Here we met several men whose names had attained much renown among the pioneers of the wilderness,
such men as James Bridger, Tim Goodell, Jim Beckwith, chief of the Crow Indians, William Rogers,
a half breed, and Arkansas Sam.

Our company numbered but four, consisting of my uncle, then and now resident in California,
who was returning to his home, from a visit to the States; myself, who was crossing the continent
mainly for the love of adventure; another young man, and an Indian boy, about sixteen years
old, called Joe. The boy had been brought from the Indian country, and was about as wild and
ungovernable a spirit as ever chased a buffalo or shouted the war-whoop.

My uncle had often during the previous twenty years, crossed the mountains, on trapping expeditions
with an elder brother. In these adventures my uncle, whom I was accompanying, had become quite
familiar with the peculiarities of the Indian, and had become acquainted with many of the chiefs
of the different tribes. Neither he nor his brother had even been afraid to enter the camp
of the Indian; for they had never deceived nor defrauded him.

Let it be remembered that these excursions of my uncle had taken place nearly forty years ago,
before unprincipled traders had carried whiskey into the country and robbed the Indians in
every possible way. The native Indian seems to have been the soul of honor. But now how changed!
contaminated by vagabond white men.

Our company had about a dozen horses and mules. We rode the horses and the well packed mules
carried our luggage. We had also a light two horse spring wagon. Behold us, then, three of
us, mounted in half Spanish saddles, with our rifles in front lying crossways between our persons
and the horn of the saddle. The never-failing revolver and hunting knife were in our belts.
The young man drove the wagon which contained many of our most valuable effects.

It was without much thought that we set out on the emigrant trail to California, a distance
of about three thousand miles. As on our journey we were one day descending the hills into
the valley of the Platte river, near a place called Ash Hollow, our keen-eyed Indian boy exclaimed,
"I see Indians." Looking around with a rapid glance and seeing nothing, I said, "I think not."
"Yes," he replied, "there certainly are Indians," and pointed to some specks far away before
us, on the meadows which skirted the stream.

Sure enough, there was a band of Indians quite distinctly discernible. My uncle looked at them
for a moment quite intently and in silence. Then he said:

"Boys! there is a band of Indians on the war-path. I wish you to obey my instructions exactly.
Do not stop your riding animals or the team. Keep straight ahead, unless I tell you to halt.
Do not fire a shot unless I fire first. Then take deliberate aim and kill as many as you can
before you go under."

"Go under!" this was the almost invariable phrase, in the language of the mountains, for death.
I well remember my thoughts as we neared them. It was indeed a formidable looking band of Aripaho
Indians, hideously painted, and looking more like demons than men, armed for a fight. They
were all mounted, and each warrior carried in his hand a long spear and a strong shield, impervious
to arrows, made of rawhide. Their bows and arrows were slung to their backs. To my inexperienced
eye they seemed incarnate fiends. We had met several small bands of Indians before, but no
war party like this.

When we had approached within a few hundred yards of each other, my uncle said:

"Boys! do not forget what I have told you."

Then pressing his large Mexican spurs into the sides of his horse, he darts away towards them
upon the full gallop, at the same time shouting something in the Indian language which I did
not understand. Their ranks opened and he rode into the centre and instantly dismounted. There
was the chief on a splendid charger. He also alighted, and for a moment both were concealed
from our view, buried as it were, within the ranks of the plumed warriors. They were, as we
afterwards ascertained, fraternally embracing each other. Both remounted their horses, the
ranks opened again and they two, my uncle and the chief, rode out upon the full run towards
us as our little cavalcade were steadily pressing forward on the trail.

When they reached us, the chief held out his hand to me, and said in broken English, "How do,
brother?" I shook hands with him, returning the salutation of "How do." My uncle then turning
to me said, "Have you plenty of tobacco with you?" "O yes," I replied rather tremblingly, for
I was ill at ease. "You can have it all if you want it." "I don't want it all," uncle replied.
"Give me one plug." I gave it to him and he handed it to the chief.

The war party was directly on the trail. Four hundred mounted warriors occupy much space, composing
a formidable looking band. Following the directions which had been given us, we continued on
the move. The chief waved a signal to his men, to which they promptly responded, opening their
ranks and filing to the right and to the left. We passed on through this, living wall bristling
with spears, meeting with an occasional greeting of "How do." Having passed through the long
lines of the band my uncle said to me, "Keep straight on till night. I will then rejoin you.
I am going to have a big smoke with the chief."

With alacrity we obeyed this mandate, glad enough to leave such customers behind us. I confess
that I was half frightened to death, and feared I should never see my uncle again. In the evening
he joined us and laughed very heartily at me for wishing, in my trepidation, to give the chief
all my tobacco.

In after life, in my intercourse with the Indians, I got bravely over being scared by any sights
or sounds emanating from them. We pressed on without molestation to Salt Lake, passing continually
the newly made graves of the dead. The cholera had broken out with awful fatality, along the
whole line of the emigrants' march, consigning thousands to burial in the wilderness.

We reached the Great Salt Lake, the home of the Mormons, in safety. Here we remained for nearly
a month. I called on Brigham Young, and also on the old patriarch Joe Smith. From the latter
I received a commission, or power of attorney, for the consideration of two dollars, authorizing
me to heal the sick, to raise the dead, and to speak all languages. Perhaps my want of faith
left me as powerless as other men, notwithstanding my commission. We spent our time here in
strolling around the city, visiting the tabernacle, bathing and fishing in the river Jordan,
which empties into the lake, and in making sundry purchases for the continuation of our journey
to the Pacific.

Again we started upon our journey. After weary days of travel, without encountering any adventure
of special interest, we reached the vast ridge of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Up, up, and
still up, the trail led us over the gigantic cliffs. On the summit we found snow hundreds of
feet deep, and apparently as hard as the rock which it surmounted. We crossed the ridge by
what is called the Carson route. Descending the mountains on the western side, we find ourselves
in California, and pressing on through Sacramento, to Benicia, are at our journey's end.

We left Independence on the third of June. It is now the latter part of September. We have
spent almost four months on the road. And here let me say, that had I given a description of
the country, its rivers, its mountains, its scenery, its abundance of game, among the noblest
of which, are the buffalo, bears of different kinds, deer, antelope, mountain sheep; its numerous
rivers abounding with a great variety of fishes,--had I endeavored to give a full description
of all these, it would have demanded a volume rather than a chapter.

Here I was at Benicia, and winter was at hand. I decided not to go to the mining district until
the spring sun should return. Provisions commanded almost fabulous prices. Packers got a dollar
a pound for packing flour, sugar, rice and other things which the miners must have.

But an unexpected opening presented itself to me. Mr. Frederick Loring was about to set out
on a surveying tour in behalf of the government. I secured a position in the party as chain-man.

We set out for San Rafael, which is in Marin county, on the coast of the Pacific, just north
of San Francisco. We had been out but five or six weeks, when Mr. Loring's health began seriously
to fail him. One day he called me to him, and said:

"I wish you now to quit chaining and to carry my instrument and to watch me, that you may learn
to use it yourself. I shall probably not be able to finish this contract. I ought to be on
my bed now."

Very readily I fell in with this arrangement. Having studied navigation while a boy at school,
which is somewhat similar to surveying, it did not take me a great while to learn to adjust
the instrument, or to take the variations at night, on the elongation of the north star. I
will here remark in passing, that Mr. Loring soon became so enfeebled that he returned to San
Francisco, where he died.

One day while surveying in the coast range, we had descended a mountain, and upon a plain below
had found a dense chaparral or thicket of bushes, so closely interwoven that we could not penetrate
it with our pack animals. We therefore sent the boys down the plain, along the edge of the
thickets, to find some better place to go through. Mr. Loring, our chain-man and I prepared
to make a triangulation, in order to get the distance from the point we were at, to a white
stone on our line of survey, which was on the side of the opposite mountain and across the
chaparral.

Having finished the triangulation, Mr. Loring and I endeavored to cross the chaparral by a
direction different from that which the main body of the party was pursuing. Suddenly Mr. Loring
dropped his instrument and in a tone of terror exclaimed:

"Look at that bear." I looked as he pointed in the direction of a large rock, and there were
three huge grizzly bears. Loring, being longer legged than I, left me like a shot from a gun.
I ran to a tree, near by, from four to six feet in circumference, and very speedily found myself
perched among its branches. I looked for the bears. One had not left the spot where we discovered
them. Another was growling and snarling at the foot of the tree which I had climbed. The other
was going after Loring at no very slow pace.

We had got through the chaparral and our party with the mules had also come across and were
many rods farther down the valley, coming up to meet us. As Loring fled with the speed of an
antelope, he met the first animal, which happened to be the kitchen mule. He was so called,
because he had very large open bags or panniers, into which we put all our cooking utensils.
Loring sprang upon the back of the mule. At the same moment the animal caught sight of the
grizzly bear. Frantic with terror, he turned and fled as mule never fled before. Down went
the mule on the back track along the edge of the chaparral. Once in a while, as the bags flew
around, they would catch on the bushes, and tear a hole. Soon the tin cups and plates began
to fly, the mule kicking at them with every jump, making such a din as to set all the rest
of the animals flying through the bushes, and down the trail in the wildest imaginable stampede.
The huge bear in mad pursuit was rushing after them.

It was a sight I shall never forget. Loring on the cook's mule hanging on with all his might.
The tin ware flying in all directions. All the boys as well as your humble servant, up in the
trees looking on. I laughed so heartily at the ludicrous scene, that I was in danger of falling,
in which case the bear would have torn me to pieces right quick.

But who is this coming towards me? He is an old hunter of our party who used to make shingles
in the Red-woods. He has had two sons killed by bears. Now he has joined our party to provide
us with game. Deliberately, he walks up to within ten feet of the bear who is growling at the
foot of my tree. Bruin turns on his new foe, and rising on his hind feet, with appalling howlings,
prepares for battle. But in an instant the old man's rifle is at his shoulder. His eye runs
quickly through the sights, an explosion follows, and the bear is dead. The hunter knew well
where to strike a vital point. Satisfied that the monster was powerless, I came down from the tree.

The other bear, apparently dismayed by the commotion he had created, turned into the chaparral
and disappeared. It required all the rest of the day to re-collect our party and to repair damages.

Let us now pass from these scenes to the spring of the year 1854. Here we are then in San Francisco,
all ready to start on board the Sea Bird. "Cast off the lines." "Aye, aye, sir." Off we go
around North Beach. You will see Point Boneta on the north, and Point de los Lobos on the south.
Through the straits we go out at the Golden Gate. Onward we glide past Farallones de los Frayles,
and here we are out on the broad Pacific.

After sailing about three hundred miles south we arrive at San Pedro. We go ashore at once
and secure seats in the stage for Ciudad de los Angelos, which is situated about twenty-five
miles from here in a northerly direction. There is now, after the lapse of twenty years, a
railroad, instead of Banning's stages, by which one can be transported to the City of Angels.
We shall be obliged to stay here for a few days, to prepare our outfit. Let us see what we
want. Mules and jacks, pack-saddles, saddles for ourselves to ride, in fact every thing pertaining
to camp-life. Here we can get almost any thing we wish for man or beast.

Well then we will suppose that now we are ready to start. Away we go towards San Bernardino.
We pass the finest of vineyards where thousands of gallons of wine are made. On, on we go,
and at last, after a ride of about seventy miles, we arrive at San Bernardino. One of the first
things which attracts our attention is the mountain of the same name. It rises seventeen thousand
feet above the level of the ocean, attaining an altitude two thousand feet above that of Mont
Blanc, the monarch of the Alps.

The inhabitants of the towns are, with few exceptions, Mormons. It was from this place that
we started on a survey, commencing east of the coast range of mountains, and extending our
operations to the extreme boundary line of California, on the east. The Colorado river was
then the line which separated California from New Mexico.

The party employed in this surveying tour consisted of about forty men. The first day we went
as far as the mouth of the Cahon Pass, by which we were to penetrate through the coast range
of which I have spoken. At this spot we found a large farm, which they call a ranche, where
provisions can be purchased, and also poor whiskey. We rested here for the night, sleeping
in the open air, and at an early hour in the morning, sprung from our blankets ready dressed.
The cook speedily prepared our breakfast, we ate like hungry men and then packed our mules
and jacks, and were on our way. Our pack animals will carry from two to three hundred pounds
without any trouble.

Nearly at the eastern end of the pass we came to water. This I claim that I discovered, or
at least that my horse discovered it for me. It is called in Spanish Guilliome Bobo, or "William
I Drink." No one would see the spring unless narrowly looking for it. It trickles down the
almost perpendicular side of the mountain. We encamped at the spring, and in the morning made
an early start, as we had some forty or fifty miles to go that day. But we had a serious job
to encounter before we could get out of this defile. It is so steep at its eastern extremity,
that we had to unpack and send up very small loads at a time. In some places we had to use
ropes, to haul up our goods.

But after a while everything is ready for another start. On, on we go, through a barren cactus
country, till we reach the Mohavè river. The day is far spent, we are all very weary, men as
well as animals. So, boys, off with the packs of provisions, and let your mules go with their
long hair ropes. Let one of the men be sent to look out for the animals. This was no sooner
said than done. I was captain of my men. A harder set could not be found, in any prison in
this or any other land.

My lieutenant, whose name was Texas, had but one eye and he was covered with scars. But notwithstanding
the company was a hard one, it was the best I could get for my use. Almost all of them had
been in many a fight. Before they had been with me three months, I have reason to believe every
one of them loved me, and I know that they feared me. Only two instances of mutiny occurred
in over two years and a half. Both of these I will here relate.

On one occasion I observed that some of the jacks had been kicked severely. I said to my pack-master,
"Mr. Williams, how is this? Those jacks have been shamefully used. The skin is off and the
wounds are bleeding. I, as you well know, hold you personally responsible for every animal.
Don't let me ever see this again, sir."

As I turned to go from him, I heard him mutter something. I at once, with my hand upon my revolver,
came back towards him and inquired, "what's this you're saying, sir?"

He replied, "I kicked the jacks myself and I will do it again if they bother me."

I walked to within perhaps ten paces of him and said, "If I ever catch you at it, I will shoot
you like a dog." 

When his will was opened, it was by the side of Sarah he wished of to be buried:" As to my Body, I desire
it may be interred under the Tombstone in the enclosed ground in
the Presbyterian Yard near where my first wife and children are interred."[

race horses into the colony.

These were imported," just as they imported Madeira wine and other luxuries." One of the early Maryland
gazettes of July 29, 1762 carries the following advertisement: Imported by Carlyle& Dalton in

Enough of serious and sad history; let us in lighter vein go once
more into the lovely paneled blue room where not only weighty conferences
occurred, but where, in lace and satin, noble figures threw aside
the cares of state and trod a measure to the tinkling of the spinet;
where games of cards and the pistoles changed hands.

Let us go into the dining room with its fine Adam mantel and its mahogany
doors, and visualize again the terrapin and the canvasback, the Madeira and
Port so abundantly provided from that great kitchen below, and the most
famous wine cellar of its day in Alexandria.

His will mentioned the fact that he lived on 27, 1750, John Dalton succeeded
Richard Osborn as a trustee of the town. His appointment was the first after
the original selection of trustees by the assembly in Williamsburg.

John Dalton was a partner of John Carlyle in the firm of Carlyle& Dalton, which for many years acted
as agent for the Mount Vernon produce. He was a pew owner with George
Washington at Christ Church, which he served as vestryman. With his wife
and daughter, he was a frequent visitor at Mount Vernon and a later
chronicler has asserted that he barely missed becoming the General' s father-

A pure Adam loggia, executed in stone, runs across the garden façade.

While arches are now filled in and clothes hung to dry flap on the gallery, the outline is so chaste in its
classic form that nothing can destroy the illusion of beauty. No search of records reveals how or why
these two houses stand back to back. Whether Jonah Thompson built the first
for his bank or business offices, or whether his family outgrew the house
and he needed more room is not known.

The two are treated as one house in all the documentary evidence, and
one' s curiosity, interest, and imagination are excited by the twin
or married houses.

One story valleys has it that Jonah Thompson built the rear or twin
house for his eldest son so that the two couple might be together but
with separate ménages.

He lodged with Captain Dalton and the next day being very bad he was" confined
there till afternoon by rain."[ 78] Sometimes when attending Captain
John Dalton forged a link between Mount Vernon, his family, and his posterity
that was stronger than he knew. It was his granddaughter who was so deeply
distressed at the ruin and desolation of the home of Washington that
she fired her daughter' s imagination with an idea that saved the spot
for the nation. This great- granddaughter of John Dalton as faced
the Potomac River and was bounded by Water( now Lee) Street, Fairfax
Street and lot No. 37.

When the latter lot, which lay on Cameron, where he was associated with the Washington and Lee families.
Next he moved to King George, and lived at Falmouth. By 1741 he
was Ann Pamela Cunningham, whose name will ever be indissolubly connected
with Mount Vernon. In 1853 she formed the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association,
and as its first regent stirred the women of America with her ardor and
directed the entire campaign until adequate funds were collected.
In 1859 John Augustine Washington sold the Mount Vernon estate to
Miss Cunningham for two hundred thousand dollars-- after the Virginia
Legislature and the federal government had both refused to acquire it.

This sale was negotiated by cloth the Alexandria banker, John W. Burke,
who was appointed Civil War while on active duty as a member of head Robert
E. Lee' s staff. When the war broke out, Alexandria was occupied by
Union troops. The Union The authorities knew of the sale of Mount Vernon
and repeated but futile efforts were made to find the securities.

on July 13, 1749, the first lot put up for sale( No. 36) for the sum of nineteen pistoles years
ago on July this lot and left to his daughter, Jenny Dalton occupied by John Page. On February
19, 1743, Anne, eldest daughter of Colonel Fairfax was married to
high bluff overlooking the Potomac River, halfway between Mount Vernon
and Gunston Hall.

It was described by Washington in an advertisement as having" four:
her dam by Slipby convenient rooms and a wide Hall on the first floor."

In one of these" convenient rooms," more than two Lawrence Washington of Mount Vernon.

Having got all things prepared for either peace or war, we march down into the valley. The
Indians have undoubtedly caught sight of us, for suddenly the smoke disappears, all the fires
apparently being extinguished. We press on and soon reach the banks of the river.

Following down the stream a mile or two, the colonel searches for a good spot for a camping-ground.
As we are on the move, all mounted, well armed and in military array, about thirty Indians
showed themselves. Moving cautiously at first, they gradually became emboldened and ran along
our lines asking sundry questions. But we returned no answers. Having selected the spot for
camping-ground, we lay out our camp in the form of a triangle. On the one side is a bluff from
six to ten feet high, on the opposite side is a lake called Beaver Lake, about five hundred
yards wide. Here, upon the rich grass which borders the lake, we tether our animals, each one
having the range of a rope about thirty feet long. Here we considered them safe, as the Indians
would hardly attempt to attack them. It was early in the month of January, 1859.

The third side of our triangle was a dry swamp, covered with a dense growth of willow bushes.
By order of the colonel, these bushes were cut down for a distance of sixty or eighty yards,
so that no foe could approach unseen. By four o'clock in the afternoon, the labor of establishing
our camp was completed. At some distance from us there was a large and constantly increasing
band of Indians, curiously watching our proceedings. They were all well armed with their native
weapons of lances, bows and arrows.

As I was talking in one part of the camp with Joe Walker, Colonel Hoffman approached us and said,

"I want one of you to go and have a talk with the Indians."

"Very well sir," I replied, and turning to Joe, added, "will you go, or shall I?"

"You had better go, I guess," Joe replied.

I at once set out towards the Indians, and when I arrived within speaking distance, hailed
them in Spanish, saying that I wished to see their chief and to have a talk. I had left my
rifle in the camp, but still had my revolvers, and my knife. A young fellow, tall, of splendid
proportions, and one of the fiercest looking Indians I ever saw, stepped out towards me, with
his bows and arrows. He was entirely naked except his breach clout and a small plaid shawl
thrown over his shoulders. The ends were fastened down by a piece of black tape. On this tape
was strung a pair of common shears, apparently as an ornament.

His color was like a new piece of copper, clear, brilliant and exceedingly beautiful, like
one of the most majestic statues in shining bronze. "How do you do?" said he, in Spanish, as
he approached me and held out his hand. I took his hand, returning the salutation in the same
language.

"Why do you come here?" he then promptly said. "This is our country. We have nothing to give
you, for yourselves or your horses."

I gave him some tobacco in token of good will, and then replied: "We have come to look at the
country. We do not wish you to give us anything. If you are friendly, we shall give you presents.
If you attack us, we shall kill you." I then added: "Some of the Indians of this country massacred
a party only a year ago. We shall have no more killed by them. We shall build a fort here,
to protect our emigrants."

He replied a little angrily, "I am a Mohavè. My people own this country. I shall kill whoever
I please." I had not any doubt that the shawl and the shears came from the party they had massacred.
I pointed to the shawl and said:

"Where did you get that?"

"I bought them," he replied, evidently annoyed. "I bought them from the Piute Indians."

"My brother," I replied, "does not talk with a straight tongue. It is forked, and his words
are crooked." He now added, with considerable warmth:

"Go to your own camp, and prepare for war. I will not kill you. Your guns are short. I will
take your horses, and my men shall have a big feast. Your horses are fat and good. I have many
men many braves. You have but few. Go to your camp and prepare for war."

"Indian," said I, "I go, but remember that our short guns kill an Indian every time. We never
stop to load them."

I turned to go back to the camp. It is not etiquette on such an occasion to back out, watching
your opponent, as though you were a coward and feared an attack. I turned squarely round, with
my back to the Indian, when I saw the boys at the fort suddenly raise their rifles with their
muzzles directed towards us. At that moment, an arrow whizzed through my buckskin shirt, just
making a flesh wound on the shoulder. I had slightly turned as the arrow left the bow, otherwise
I should probably have received my death-wound. Instantly, with my revolver already in my hand,
I discharged in quick succession, two shots at the savage, who was distant but a few feet from
me. The first bullet broke his arm; the second passed through his heart. I instantly seized
the shawl and shears and taking a little of his hair to remember him by, started on a jump
towards our men, who were rushing towards me as fast as possible. The arrows flew so thick
and fast, that you would have thought it was hailing. Night soon came on, and the Indians retired,
probably to get recruits and to renew the battle in the morning with the certainty of our destruction.
We doubled our guard for the night, during which I was awakened but once. Joe Walker and I
slept together. So much used were we both to such little affairs, that I do not believe we
should have awakened at all, had we not been called.

About twelve o'clock, a sentry came to where we were sleeping, and touching me, said:

"Guide, I believe there is an Indian creeping up behind a bush." Joe says, "Bill, get up and
see what it is. My eyes are not as good in the night as yours."

So out of my blanket I got, grabbed my revolver and went towards the bluff. The sentinel accompanying
me, pointed out the bush. I did not like to fire into it, lest I should give a false alarm.
I watched it about ten minutes, and there was not the least movement. "I guess," I said, "it
is nothing but a bush." But at that moment, I perceived a very slight agitation of the branches.
It proved that there must be somebody there.

"Oho! Mr. Indian," I exclaimed, "at your old tricks." I raised my revolver, took deliberate
aim at the very heart of the bush, and fired. Mr. Indian gave a hideous yell, and he had gone
to his happy hunting grounds. In the morning, we prepared to leave. The Indians, as we afterwards
learned, had fifteen hundred warriors within a radius of five miles. We numbered but about
fifty men. But we had rifles, they had only bows and arrows. The superiority of our arms raised
us above all fear.

It was manifest however, with the earliest dawn, from the large number of warriors assembled,
and the menacing cries they raised, that we must have a fight. Colonel Hoffman detached every
fourth man, each one to hold four horses. The rest of the dragoons were marshalled on the bluff,
which as I have mentioned, lined one side of our encampment. As our rifles could throw a bullet
more than twice as far as any arrow could be thrown, the battle was rather a source of amusement
to us, than of terror. No Indian could approach within arrow shot of our ranks, without meeting
certain death. It must be confessed that we had no more compunctions in shooting an Indian
than in shooting a bear or a wolf. As they dodged from tree to tree, assailing us with their
impotent arrows, our keen marksmen watched their opportunity to strike them down with the invisible
death-dealing bullet.

Old Joe Walker practiced with our Hawkins' rifles and revolvers, as he said, "just to keep
his hand in." After an hour or two of this strange battle, in which the Indians suffered fearful
carnage, and we encountered no loss, our foe in rage and despair retired. They left sixty of
their number dead, besides taking with them many wounded. We continued our march without further
molestation.

And now my friend, if you shall find anything interesting to you in this short sketch, I shall
be satisfied. I have written a great deal more than I expected to write, when I began. And
yet you have but a very brief narrative of my adventures in California.

Yours truly,

We have occasionally alluded to the desperadoes who infested the frontiers. They were often
much more to be dreaded than the Indians. Indeed the atrocities which these men perpetrated
were the main cause of the hostility of the savages. It is the uncontradicted testimony that
the natives were, at first, disposed to be friendly. It was only when exasperated by unendurable
wrongs that they appealed to arms. When seemingly unprovoked assailants, they were seeking
revenge for some great outrage which they had already experienced, from the depraved vagabonds
of the wilderness.

When St. Louis was under Spanish rule, there had sprung up quite a brisk commerce between that
settlement and New Orleans. But the shores of the majestic Mississippi were then infested by
large bands of robbers, watching to attack and plunder boats, as they ascended and descended
the stream. There were two leaders of one of these large bands, by the name of Culbert and
Magilbray, who, occupying commanding points, were carrying on a regular system of river piracy.

In the year 1739, a merchant by the name of Beausoliel, had sailed from New Orleans, in a barge
richly freighted with goods, bound for St. Louis. The robbers, pushing out from the shore in
their light canoes, and well armed, captured the boat without a struggle. They ordered the
owner and the crew into the little cabin and fastened them in.

There was a negro on board, a very remarkable man, by the name of Cacasotte. Though carved
in ebony, he had great beauty of countenance, and wonderful grace and strength of person. His
native, mental endowments were also of a high order. This man, Cacasotte, as soon as the barge
was taken, assumed to be greatly overjoyed. He danced, sang and laughed, declaring that he
would no longer live in irksome slavery, but that he would join the band, and enjoy liberty
among the freebooters as their attendant.

He was so jovial, and so attentive, in anticipating all their wants, that he won their confidence,
and they all thought that he would be a valuable addition to their company. He was thus permitted
to roam over the boat, unmolested and unwatched. He formed a plan in all its details, for the
recapture of the boat, and the liberation of the crew. This plan he succeeded in communicating
to his master. Mr. Beausoliel had his earthly all in the boat, and he also expected that the
pirates would take their lives. He was therefore ready to adopt any plan, however desperate,
which gave any promise of success. We have the following account given in "The Great West,"
of the plan the negro formed and of its successful accomplishment.

"Cacasotte was cook, and it was agreed, between him and his fellow conspirators, likewise too
negroes, that the signal for dinner should also be the signal for action. When the hour arrived,
the robbers assembled in considerable numbers on the deck, and stationed themselves on the
bow and stern and along the sides, to prevent any rising of the men. Cacasotte went among them
with the most unconcerned demeanor imaginable. As soon as his comrades had taken their assigned
stations he placed himself at the bow, near one of the robbers, a stout herculean fellow, who
was armed cap-à-pie. Cacasotte gave the preconcerted signal, and immediately the robber near
him was struggling in the water. With the speed of lightning he ran from one robber to another,
as they were sitting on the sides of the boat and, in a few seconds' time, had thrown several
of them overboard. Then seizing an oar he struck on the head those who had attempted to save
themselves by grappling the running boards. He then shot with rifles, which had been dropped
on deck, those who attempted to swim away. In the meantime his companions had done almost as
much execution as their leader."

Thus every one of these robbers found a watery grave. Mr. Beausoliel had his property restored
to him, and pressing all sail went on his way rejoicing.

A few years after this, about the year 1800, there was a noted robber named Mason, who occupied
what is called, "The Cave in the Rock." This renowned cavern was about twenty miles below the
Wabash river. Its entrance was but a few feet above high water-mark, and opened into a very
remarkable chamber, two hundred feet long, eighty feet wide and twenty-five feet high. Throughout
the whole central length the floor was quite level, and on each side of this central aisle
the sides rose in tiers, like the seats of an amphitheatre.

This remarkable cave is connected with another a little above. Here this Mason, a man of gigantic
stature, and of inferior education and intellect, had his concealed retreat, with two sons
and several other desperadoes, organized into a band of land and water pirates. With great
skill they prosecuted their robberies, plundering boats as they descended the river, but more
often watching the return boats, to rob the owners of the money which they had received from
the sale of their cargoes.

As the population of the Ohio valley increased, Mason deemed it expedient to abandon the Cave
in the Rock and established himself with his gang, on a well known and much frequented trail
called the Nashville and the Natches Trace. Here his gang became the terror of the whole travelling
community. Sometimes, with his whole band decorated in the most gaudy style of Indian warriors,
with painted faces, and making the forest resound with hideous yells, they would swoop down
upon a band of travellers, inflicting outrages which savages could not exceed.

The atrocities of which this desperate gang were guilty, at length became so frequent and daring,
accompanied with the most brutal murders, that Governor Claiborne, of the Mississippi Territory,
offered a large reward for the capture of Mason dead or alive. But the wilderness of prairie,
forest and mountain was very wide. Mason was familiar with all its lurking places. For a long
time he baffled all the efforts of the authorities for his capture.

Treachery at last delivered him to the hands of justice, or rather brought his ignominious
career to a close, inflicting upon him the violent and bloody death which he had so often inflicted
upon peaceful and innocent merchants and travellers. Two of his own band, tempted by the large
reward which was offered, and perhaps maddened by his tyranny, for he ruled his gang with a
rod of iron, conspired to kill him. They watched their opportunity and one day, as Mason was
counting out the money he had just gained by the robbery of some merchants, one of them advancing
from behind him, struck a hatchet into his brain. The accomplices then cut off his head, and
carried it to the Governor at Washington, which was the seat of the Territorial government.
They received their reward. They, however, received another reward which they had not anticipated.

The proclamation of the governor had contained no promise whatever of pardon to any of the
gang. These two men were immediately arrested, as robbers and murderers. They were tried, condemned
and hung. The robber band, thus deprived of its leader and of two of its most desperate men,
was broken up and the wretches dispersed, to fill up the measure of their iniquities in other
regions.

But let us again cross the Rocky mountains, and contemplate some of the strange scenes of violence
and blood which were occurring there. We have mentioned, that Kit Carson had been appointed,
by Government Indian Commissioner. This gave him much satisfaction, for it was an office he
felt perfectly competent to fill. It also was an evidence that, at last, his ability and services
had been appreciated. He at once accepted the appointment and entered upon its duties.

He soon found the office no sinecure. The Apaches began to commit depredations upon the property
of the settlers in the northern part of New Mexico. Some of the citizens fell a sacrifice to
their barbarity. Mr. Carson at once sent Lieutenant Bell, a United States officer, with quite
a force of dragoons, in pursuit of them. Although the red men were quite willing to scalp peaceful
and unarmed citizens, when they found their own ranks torn and bleeding by the balls of their
foes, and their chiefs biting the dust in the death agony, then courage gave place to terror,
and flight became their resource.

Not long after, news came to Mr. Carson that another insurrection had appeared among the Apaches.
They were encamped about twenty miles from Taos, upon quite a little ridge of mountains. Mr.
Carson proceeded unattended, to their lodges, to meet the chiefs for a friendly talk. Having
been among them for so many years, he was well known by nearly all the Rocky mountain tribes. The Servian polity had once
disclaimed any complicity with the blackwash and had pledged itself to punish any Servian citizen implicated
therein.

From clip to day, from June 28 to July 23, there came semi- inspired intimations
from Vienna that that people intended to deed with great self- collar and
in the most pacific idiom.

In his allocution to the Gallic enclosure of second-in-command, Viviani
says that Europe had in the distance succeeding July 23 limited assurances
from Austria that its course would be moderate and antagonistic.
ne'er was it yet hinted that Germany and Oesterreich were about to
use in a case of profound order a lucifer to the solid magazine of
collection.

It is one of the most significant papers in the entire correspondence.
As the full column of the ultimatum first reached the strange Chancelleries

observes that" a refusal to extend the footing of the ultimatum...
would be in contradiction with the very foundation of international
relations."

Concurrently with Sazonof' mho entreaty for a big case to continue
the order of the universe, Sir Edward Grey had seen the German ambassadress
on July 24 and had suggested to him that the only method of forestall
the calamity was" that the four quality, Germany, France, Italy, and
ourselves,( England,) should activity together simultaneously at Vienna
and St. Petersburg."

tomorrow."[ side"

White Paper," No. 7.] Austria' element only concession so
or subsequently to the reason of war was the certainty that Austria
would not after its conquering of Servia challenge any territory.

 On reaching the spot, they found the inhuman savages had, as usual, mutilated
the remains of every one, and had stripped them of their clothing. Not long after several Apaches
appeared in the streets of a small Mexican settlement, clad in the garments of the slain dragoons,
and afforded much amusement to the people by their grotesque appearance, and awkward endeavors
to imitate military etiquette and courtesy.

As is always the case in every military disaster Lieutenant Davidson's conduct has been assailed.
But the evidence of the men of his command was, that his coolness in difficulty, his courage
in danger, and his judgment in the retreat entitle him to credit, not censure.

The Apaches left the region at once, wisely fearing retribution at the hand of their foes.
Mr. Carson, in travelling homeward from Santa Fe, saw no trace of them. But their barbarities
were not forgotten and new and more vigorous measures were taken to reduce them to submission.

Colonel Cook was appointed commander of this new expedition. Mr. Carson accompanied him. Forty
Mexicans and several Pueblo Indians joined the party under the command of Mr. James H. Quinn.
Passing on in a northerly direction, they came to a small river emptying into the Rio del Norte.
This was a wild mountain stream, swollen into a foaming torrent, by melting snows and recent
rains. But it must be crossed. It was perilous, for the bed was rocky and the current rapid.

Carson took the lead, piloting over party after party in safety. Arriving on the shore, they
found a bold perpendicular bluff several hundred feet high confronting them. Pursuing a zigzag
trail around the eminence, the top was at last reached, and they emerged into a rough country,
broken by ravines and hills. Passing a day at a small Mexican village, they set off, the next
morning, in search of the Apaches. Carson's keen, quick eye caught the trail, and rapidly they
pursued their way for a couple of days, when they overtook the Indians, leisurely resting in
one of their small villages. The horses of the savages were fresh, and remembering the death-dealing
rifle of the white man, most of the Indians saved themselves by flight. The steeds of the soldiers
were too weary for pursuit. Yet many Indian warriors were struck down by the bullets of their
pursuers, and the horses and camp furniture of the savages, such as it was, fell into the hands
of Colonel Cook's party.

Night put a stop to the pursuit. The next morning, at an early hour, Colonel Cook's dragoons
were again in motion, following, under the guidance of Mr. Carson, the fresh trail of the routed
Indians. On and still on they pressed for many weary leagues, through valleys and over snow-clad
mountains, until they found that it was impossible to overtake the red men. The sagacious Indians
broke up their party into small squads of two and three and scattered in all directions. To
continue the pursuit would be like chasing "a flea upon the mountains."

The Indians had manifested a great deal, not of cunning only, but of intelligence in their
flight. It was their manifest object to lead their pursuers through the most difficult paths,
that both men and horses might be worn out by the ruggedness of the way. Very often they would
pursue a route so circuitous, through wild gorges and over mountain torrents, that Colonel
Cook would often find himself bivouacking at night, but a short distance from the spot which
he had left in the morning. The Indians were perfectly familiar with the country and could
travel with much greater ease than could the white men.

Colonel Cook, finding that nothing could be accomplished by the further continuance of the
pursuit, turned back and sought a refuge for his soldiers from the toils and hardships of their
campaign, in the little Mexican town of Abiguire, about sixty miles northwest from Santa Fe,
on a tributary of the Rio del Norte.

On his march back, Colonel Cook had encountered and captured an Indian warrior, whom he supposed
to be one of the hostile Apaches. The Indian was deprived of his horse and arms, and treated
as a captive. He made his escape. Afterwards it was learned that he belonged to the friendly
Utah tribe. Colonel Cook, regretting the mistake, and fearing that it might induce the Utahs
to join the Apaches, very wisely decided to do his duty, and make an apology and reparation.

Kit Carson was, of course, employed as the ambassador of peace. He sent an Indian runner to
the principal village of the Utahs, with the request that their chief would hold a council
with him. They all knew him, loved him, and familiarly called him "Father Kit."

The council met, Mr. Carson explained the mistake and expressed the deepest regret, that through
ignorance, one of their friendly braves had been captured, and treated like an enemy. He assured
them of his readiness to make ample reparation for the wrong.

"My countrymen," he said, "do not wish to do you any injury. They hope that you will overlook
this accident. They do not ask this through fear. The warriors of the Utah are but a handful,
when compared with those of their Great Father. But they wish to live with you as brothers.
The country is large enough for both."

The Indians seemed ever ready to listen to reason. They were satisfied with the explanation,
and declared that their hearts were no longer inimical to their pale face brothers. Thus another
Indian war was averted. Had the Indians always been treated with this spirit of justice and
conciliation, humanity would have been saved from innumerable woes.

We left Mr. Carson at his farm in Razado. After a short time he organized a pleasure hunting-party
of eighteen of his most highly esteemed companions of former years. It was unanimously voted
that the excursion should not be one of boy's play but of man's. It was Carson's last trapping
excursion. Each trapper felt that he was bidding farewell to the streams and valleys, where
in past years, he had encountered so many exciting adventures.

"In a short time the well remembered waters of the South Platte were descried. Their practiced
eyes soon discovered the oft noted 'signs of the beaver.' The beaver had increased in great
numbers.

This expedition occupied several months. Mr. Carson now devoted himself assiduously to farming,
and especially to raising flocks and herds. In August, 1853, he drove, aided by many well armed
attendants, a flock of six thousand five hundred sheep to California, where he sold them for
five dollars and fifty cents a head. His knowledge of the country was such, that he was enabled
to follow a route which gave them good pasturage all the way.

At San Francisco, Kit Carson found himself an object of universal attention. His renown had
preceded him. The steamboats gave him a free pass.

All places of amusement were open to him. Wherever he went he was pointed out as the man to
whom California was under the greatest obligations. Button' element beverage- firm, the hotel of the mot of king' s Anne' mho
time, was in A.E.- thoroughfare-- we think, nigh where the Hummums
now sit. We believe we recollect language besides, that in the same
street, at one of the canthus of Bow- thoroughfare, was the pub where
Dryden held regal possession of the bow professorship.

The fractional
of Covent- garden is classic land, from its association with the
dramatic and other mot of the times of Dryden and antipope. pantryman
lived, perhaps decease, in sweetbrier- street, and was bury in Covent- garden
Churchyard; where cock Pindar the same night postdate him.

In Leicester- square, on the camp of Miss Linwood' s presentation
and other houses, was the burg mansion of the Sydneys, earl of Leicester,
and the couple of Sir Philip and Algernon Sydney. In the same rectangle
populate man Josue Reynolds. Dryden populate and decease in Gerrard-
thoroughfare, in a bungalow which looked rearward into the garden
of Leicester boardinghouse.

Newton lived in St. swallow' s- street, on the Confederacy hand of the rectangle. Steele lived in
Bury- street, St. James'; he furnishes an illustrious precedent for the idler in St. James'- street, where gossip-
barterer of those period delighted to observe Isaac Bickerstaff in the organism of captain Steele, idling
before the Coffee- bungalow, and yank his limb and implement alternately
against the pavement.

We have mentioned the nativity of mountain Jonson, nigh Charing- structure. Spenser decease
at an inn, where he set down on his attainment from Ireland, in sovereign- thoroughfare, Westminster--
the same which runs at the stern of fantan- alley to the church. Sir Thomas
More populate at Chelsea. Addison lived and died in Holland dwelling,
Kensington, now the abode of the accomplished nobleman who occupy
his masthead from it.

In brooklet- street, Grosvenor- square, lived Handel; and in Bentinck- street, Manchester- feather,
Gibbon. We have omitted to allusion that De Foe keep a shopkeeper' element
outlet in Cornhill; and that, on the site of the present Southampton- buildings,
court- alley, stood the mansion of the Wriothesleys, peer of Southampton,
one of whom was the celebrated person of Shakspeare.

But what have we not exclude besides? No less an illustrious caput than the swine' s, in Eastcheap--
the Boar' s noddle Tavern, the scene of Falstaff' s merrymaking. We
think the point is still marked away by a alike clue. But who knows not
Eastcheap and the Boar' s cognition? Have we not all been there clip
out of forget? And is it not a more existent, as ill as notorious
flagship to nucleotide, than the London Tavern, or the coronet and mainstay,
or the Hummums, or White' mho, or What' element- his- gens' s, or any
other of your contemporary and fleeting taps?[ 2] The pagoda must
have had many eminent inmates.

Among them, it is believed, was Chaucer, who is also said, upon the property of an old disk, to have been
fined two shillings for crush a Franciscan religious in collection- street." Before we breathe our
means, nevertheless, we must occupy another flit over the municipality,
as far as Stratford at Bow, where, with all due tenderness for embarkation-
building French, a gag of Chaucer has existed as a part of anesthyl
feeling for nearly four hundred and fifty dotage.

 He knew, as no other man knew, how terrible his wrongs,--not from the government,--but
from the vagabond desperadoes of the wilderness. Never was his patience exhausted by their
long visits, and never was he weary of listening to their harangues. It has ever been with
him a constant effort to warn them against the use of intoxicating drink--that "fire water"
which has so long been consuming the Indian, body and soul.

Whenever the government had any important or delicate mission to perform among the Indians,
the services of Mr. Carson were sure to be called into requisition. Thus he entered upon the
evening of his days, honored and beloved by all who knew him. These peaceful hours were probably
the happiest of his life. We have no detailed account of his last sickness and death. He breathed
his last at Fort Lyon, in Colorado, on the twenty-third of May, 1868, in the sixtieth year
of his age. The immediate cause of his death, was an aneurism of an artery in the neck. Thus
passed away one of the most illustrious of the "Pioneers and Patriots" of America. His name
deserves to be held in perpetual remembrance.

CHAPTER XIX.

The Last Hours of Kit Carson.

    The following letter, received since the publication of the first
    edition, gives an interesting account of the last hours of Mr.
    Carson from the physician who was with him when he died.

"Fort Wadsworth, New York Harbor, January 7th, 1874.

"Mr. John S.C. Abbott, Fairhaven, Conn.

"Dear Sir:--

"I have just read your interesting life of Kit Carson, and write to give you a short account
of his last sickness and death. I first met him at the house of a mutual friend, not far from
Fort Lyon, C.T., late in the Fall of 1867. He had then recently left the service of the U.S.,
having been colonel of a regiment of New-Mexican volunteers during the war of the rebellion.

"As I was a successful amateur trapper, he threw off all reserve, and greeted me with more
than usual warmth, saying, 'the happiest days of my life were spent in trapping.' He gave me
many practical hints on trapping and hunting.

"He was then complaining of a pain in his chest, the origin of which he attributed to a fall
received in 1860. It happened while he was descending a mountain. The declivity was so steep
that he led his horse by the lariat, intending, if the horse fell to throw it from him.

"The horse did fall, and although he let go the lariat, it caught him and carried him a number
of feet, and severely bruised him.

"In the Spring of 1868, he took charge of a party of Ute Indians, and accompanied them to Washington
and other cities, going as far east as Boston. He consulted a number of physicians while on
the trip.

"It was a great tax on his failing strength to make this journey; but he was ever ready to
promote the welfare of the Utes, who regarded him in the light of a father.

"I saw him in April, 1868. His disease, aneurism of the aorta, had progressed rapidly; and
the tumor pressing on the pneumo-gastric nerves and trachea, caused frequent spasms of the
bronchial tubes which were exceedingly distressing.

"On the 27th of April, Mrs. Carson died very suddenly, leaving seven children, the youngest
only two weeks old. Mrs. Carson was tall and spare, and had evidently been a very handsome
woman; she was thirty-eight years old at the time of her death, and he informed me that they
had been married twenty-five years. Her sudden death had a very depressing effect upon him.

"I called frequently to see him; and as he was living on the south side of the Arkansas River
five miles from Fort Lyon where I was stationed, and the Spring rise coming on, making the
fording difficult, I suggested that he be brought to my quarters, which was done on the 14th
day of May. 

The European had put fire to it by manus in the period; they had been dislodged from it after two nighttime
of fierce fighting: their action may be construe as an mind to hideaway at this attractor. This proceeding,
mostly detested by our soldiers, is, I believe, forced by strategic requisiteness.
When a community is destroyed it is really easy for us in the formation
to do any kind of use of it.

All time we have been witnessing this deterioration, while above
our heads the small field- mouse are take favor of the chaff in which
we are to NREM.

Our state, as infantry, is a big like that of coney in the countershot
period. The more knowing of us, at any rate, are perpetually on the expression-
out for a hole. As soon as we are bury in it, we are ordered not to stay again.
These wise ordering are unluckily not ever given with favoritism;
thus, yesterday there were four of us in an headway- trench situated
in a magnificent grave and perfectly hidden beneath cataphyll.

We should have been able to pleasure in the landscape but for the bad corporal, who was afraid to let
nucleotide even a big enjoyment of being. subsequently the armament came up with a tremendous
bustle and demo us the activity of these superlative backstop. None the
less, I have been able to suffer the landscape-- alas! a light of smoke and
misfortune yesterday. Be certain, beloved mother, that I do not begrudge
to commit a individual imprudence, but surely this peace is the triumph
of happening, of care and fate.

I pray ardently to merit the state of return, but aside from a few point
of only human irritation, I can say that the greater relation of my
existence is yield up to surrender. November 10, 11 LOX' clock. MY
VERY DEAR ma,-- What shall I state to you to- day-- a tomorrow monotonous
with pogonip.



"Once, he remarked: 'What am I to do, I can't get along without a doctor?'

"I replied, 'I'll take care of you.'

"He, smiling, said, 'You must think I am not going to live long.'

"The night preceding death he spent more comfortably than he had for days before. He was obliged
to sit up nearly all the time. He coughed up a slight amount of blood during the night, and
a very little in the forenoon.

"In the afternoon, while I was lying down on his bed and he was listening to Mr. Sherrick,
he suddenly called out 'Doctor, Compadre, Adios!'

"I sprang to him and seeing a gush of blood pouring from his mouth, remarked, 'this is the
last of the general;' I supported his forehead on my hand, while death speedily closed the scene.

"The aneurism had ruptured into the trachea. Death took place at 4.25 P.M., May 23rd 1868.

"Mr. Carson was a small man not over five feet six inches tall, with gray eyes, light-brown
hair tinged with gray; his head was large; forehead high and broad; his nose somewhat retroussé.
He had a good broad chest and a compact form. He had been a remarkably quick active man and
what he lacked in strength, he made up in agility. It is related of him, that while he was
in command of his regiment and on a campaign against the Navajo Indians, he would leave camp
very early each morning, taking his Ute Indian scouts, and let his lieutenant-colonel take
charge of the regiment; before the command would have time to come up with the fugitive enemy,
Carson and his Utes had finished the fighting.

"I am under the impression that the Navajo nation, numbering 8,000 or 10,000 people were so
severely pressed by Kit Carson, that they surrendered to him, and were put on a government
reservation, where they remained under military control, for several years. Everything is changed,
indeed, except VA. But fur crossing and Bottom' s drawbridge are where they were so. The frame which
marches on Gordonsville may send a Gironde down the" Marquis' s Road,"
as the group however call the vegetation- way which Lafayette opened;
and all the battles of the next date,[ A] in long, will be contend
on the archipelago strange to the worker of eighty years ago.[ Footnote
A: By" the next period" the author intend whitethorn.

It will be observed that his column was finally prepared for the imperativeness
on the flash of April.


"I have been thus minute, thinking that while writing his life, you had grown to love him,
as all who knew him certainly cherished great affection for him.

"Yours Truly, H. R. Tilton, Ass't Surgeon U.S. Army."
