An Original Belle

PREFACE.

No race of men, scarcely an individual, is so devoid of intelligence as not to recognize power.
Few gifts are more courted. Power is almost as varied as character, and the kind of power most
desired or appreciated is a good measure of character. The pre-eminence furnished by thew and
muscle is most generally recognized; but, as men reach levels above the animal, other qualities
take the lead. It is seen that the immaterial spirit wins the greater triumphs,--that the brainless
giant, compared with the dwarf of trained intelligence, can accomplish little. The scale runs
on into the moral qualities, until at last humanity has given its sanction to the Divine words,
"Whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant." The few who have successfully
grasped the lever of which Archimedes dreamed are those who have attained the highest power
to serve the world.

Among the myriad phases of power, perhaps that of a gifted and beautiful woman is the most
subtile and hard to define. It is not the result of mere beauty, although that may be an important
element; and if wit, intelligence, learning, accomplishments, and goodness are added, all combined
cannot wholly explain the power that some women possess. Deeper, perhaps more potent, than
all else, is an individuality which distinguishes one woman from all others, and imparts her
own peculiar fascination. Of course, such words do not apply to those who are content to be
commonplace themselves, and who are satisfied with the ordinary homage of ordinary minds, or
the conventional attention of men who are incited to nothing better.

One of the purposes of this story is to illustrate the power of a young girl not so beautiful
or so good as many of her sisters. She was rather commonplace at first, but circumstances led
her to the endeavor to be true to her own nature and conscience and to adopt a very simple
scheme of life. She achieved no marvellous success, nothing beyond the ability of multitudes
like herself.

I have also sought to reproduce with some color of life and reality a critical period in our
civil war. The scenes and events of the story culminate practically in the summer of 1863.
The novel was not written for the sake of the scenes or events. They are employed merely to
illustrate character at the time and to indicate its development.

The reader in the South must be bitter and prejudiced indeed if he does not discover that I
have sought to be fair to the impulses and motives of its people.

In touching upon the Battle of Gettysburg and other historical events, I will briefly say that
I have carefully consulted authentic sources of information. For the graphic suggestion of
certain details I am indebted to the "History of the 124th Regt. N.Y.S.V.," by Col. Charles
H. Weygant, to the recollections of Capt. Thomas Taft and other veterans now living.

Lieut.-Col. H. C. Hasbrouck, commandant of Cadets at West Point, has kindly read the proof
of chapters relating to the battle of Gettysburgh.

My story is also related to the New York Draft Riots of 1863, an historical record not dwelt
upon before in fiction to my knowledge. It is almost impossible to impart an adequate impression
of that reign of terror. I have not hoped to do this, or to give anything like a detailed and
complete account of events. The scenes and incidents described, however, had their counterpart
in fact. Rev. Dr. Howard Crosby of New York saw a young man face and disperse a mob of hundreds,
by stepping out upon the porch of his home and shooting the leader. This event took place late
at night.

I have consulted "Sketches of the Draft Riots in 1863," by Hon. J. T. Headley, the files of
the Press of that time, and other records.

The Hon. Thomas C. Acton. Superintendent of the Metropolitan Police during the riot, accorded
me a hearing, and very kindly followed the thread of my story through the stormy period in
question.

CHAPTER I.

A RUDE AWAKENING.

MARIAN VOSBURGH had been content with her recognized position as a leading belle. An evening
spent in her drawing-room revealed that; but at the close of the particular evening which it
was our privilege to select there occurred a trivial incident. She was led to think, and thought
is the precursor of action and change in all natures too strong and positive to drift. On that
night she was an ordinary belle, smiling, radiant, and happy in following the traditions of
her past.

She had been admired as a child, as a school-girl, and given a place among the stars of the
first magnitude since her formal debut. Admiration was as essential as sunshine; or, to change
the figure, she had a large and a natural and healthful appetite for it. She was also quite
as much entitled to it as the majority of her class. Thus far she had accepted life as she
found it, and was in the main conventional. She was not a deliberate coquette; it was not her
recognized purpose to give a heartache to as many as possible; she merely enjoyed in thoughtless
exultation her power to attract young men to her side. There was keen excitement in watching
them, from the moment of introduction, as they passed through the phases of formal acquaintanceship
into relations that bordered on sentiment. When this point was reached experiences sometimes
followed which caused not a little compunction.

She soon learned that society was full of men much like herself in some respects, ready to
meet new faces, to use their old compliments and flirtation methods over and over again. They
could look unutterable things at half a dozen different girls in the same season, while their
hearts remained as invulnerable as old-fashioned pin-cushions, heart-shaped, that adorn country
"spare rooms." But now and then a man endowed with a deep, strong nature would finally leave
her side in troubled wonder or bitter cynicism. Her fair, young face, her violet eyes, so dark
as to appear almost black at night, had given no token that she could amuse herself with feelings
that touched the sources of life and death in such admirers.

"They should have known better, that I was not in earnest," she would say, petulantly, and
more or less remorsefully.

But these sincere men, who had been so blind as to credit her with gentle truth and natural
intuition, had some ideal of womanhood which had led to their blunder. Conscious of revealing
so much themselves by look, tone, and touch of hand, eager to supplement one significant glance
by life-long loyalty, they were slow in understanding that answering significant glances meant
only, "I like you very well,--better than others, just at present; but then I may meet some
one to-morrow who is a great deal more fun than you are."

Fun! With them it was a question of manhood, of life, and of that which gives the highest value
and incentive to life. It was inevitable, therefore, that Marian Vosburgh should become a mirage
to more than one man; and when at last the delusion vanished, there was usually a flinty desert
to be crossed before the right, safe path was gained.

From year to year Mr. Vosburgh had rented for his summer residence a pretty cottage on the
banks of the Hudson. The region abounded in natural beauty and stately homes. There was an
infusion of Knickerbocker blood in the pre-eminently elect ones of society, and from these
there was a gradual shading off in several directions, until by some unwritten law the social
line was drawn. Strangers from the city might be received within the inner circle, or they
might not, as some of the leaders practically decreed by their own action. Mr. Vosburgh did
not care in the least for the circle or its constituents. He was a stern, quiet man; one of
the strong executive hands of the government at a time when the vital questions of the day
had come to the arbitrament of the sword. His calling involved danger, and required an iron
will. The questions which chiefly occupied his mind were argued by the mouths of cannon.

As for Marian, she too cared little for the circle and its social dignitaries. She had no concessions
to make, no court to pay. She was not a dignitary, but a sovereign, and had her own court.
Gentleman friends from the city made their headquarters at a neighboring summer hotel; young
men from the vicinity were attracted like moths, and the worst their aristocratic sisters could
say against the girl was that she had too many male friends, and was not "of their set." Indeed,
with little effort she could have won recognition from the bluest blood of the vicinage; but
this was not her ambition. She cared little for the ladies of her neighborhood, and less for
their ancestors, while she saw as much of the gentlemen as she desired. She had her intimates
among her own sex, however, and was on the best terms with her good-natured, good-hearted,
but rather superficial mother, who was a discreet, yet indulgent chaperon, proud of her daughter
and of the attention she received, while scarcely able to comprehend that any serious trouble
could result from it if the proprieties of life were complied with. Marian was never permitted
to give that kind of encouragement which compromises a girl, and Mrs. Vosburgh felt that there
her duty ceased. All that could be conveyed by the eloquent eye, the inflection of tones, and
in a thousand other ways, was unnoted, and beyond her province.

The evening of our choice is an early one in June. The air is slightly chilly and damp, therefore
the parlor is preferable to the vine-sheltered piazza, screened by the first tender foliage.
We can thus observe Miss Vosburgh's deportment more closely, and take a brief note of her callers.

Mr. Lane is the first to arrive, perhaps for the reason that he is a downright suitor, who
has left the city and business, in order to further the interests nearest his heart. He is
a keen-eyed, strong-looking fellow, well equipped for success by knowledge of the world and
society; resolute, also, in attaining his desired ends.  His attentions to Marian have been
unmistakable for some months, and he believes that he has received encouragement. In truth,
he has been the recipient of the delusive regard that she is in the habit of bestowing. He
is one whom she could scarcely fail to admire and like, so entertaining is he in conversation,
and endowed with such vitality and feeling that his words are not airy nothings.

He greets her with a strong pressure of the hand, and his first glance reveals her power.

"Why, this is an agreeable surprise, Mr. Lane," she exclaims.

"Agreeable? I am very glad to hear that," he says, in his customary direct speech. "Yes, I
ran up from the city this afternoon. On my way to lunch I became aware of the beauty of the
day, and as my thoughts persisted in going up the river I was led to follow them. One's life
does not consist wholly of business, you know; at least mine does not."

"Yet you have the reputation of being a busy man."

"I should hope so. What would you think of a young fellow not busy in these times?"

"I am not sure I should think at all. You give us girls too much credit for thinking."

"Oh, no; there's no occasion for the plural. I don't give 'us girls' anything. I am much too
busy for that. But I know you think, Miss Marian, and have capacity for thought."

"Possibly you are right about the capacity. One likes to think one has brains, you know, whether
she uses them or not. I don't think very much, however,--that is, as you use the word, for
it implies the putting of one's mind on something and keeping it there. I like to let thoughts
come and go as the clouds do in our June skies. I don't mean thunder-clouds and all they signify,
but light vapors that have scarcely beginning or end, and no very definite being. I don't seem
to have time or inclination for anything else, except when I meet you with your positive ways.
I think it is very kind of you to come from New York to give me a pleasant evening."

"I'm not so very disinterested. New York has become a dull place, and if I aid you to pass
a pleasant evening you insure a pleasanter one for me. What have you been doing this long June
day, that you have been too busy for thought?"

"Let me see. What have I been doing? What an uncomfortable question to ask a girl! You men
say we are nothing but butterflies, you know."

"I never said that of you."

"You ask a question which makes me say it virtually of myself. That is a way you keen lawyers
have. Very well; I shall be an honest witness, even against myself. That I wasn't up with the
lark this morning goes without saying. The larks that I know much about are on the wing after
dinner in the evening. The forenoon is a variable sort of affair with many people. Literally
I suppose it ends at 12 M., but with me it is rounded off by lunch, and the time of that event
depends largely upon the kitchen divinity that we can lure to this remote and desolate region.
'Faix,' remarked that potentate, sniffing around disdainfully the day we arrived, 'does yez
expects the loikes o' me to stop in this lonesomeness? We're jist at the ind of the wourld.'
Mamma increased her wages, which were already double what she earns, and she still condescends
to provide our daily food, giving me a forenoon which closes at her convenience. During this
indefinite period I look after my flowers and birds, sing and play a little, read a little,
entertain a little, and thus reveal to you a general littleness. In the afternoon I take a
nap, so that I may be wide awake enough to talk to a bright man like you in case he should
appear. Now, are you not shocked and pained at my frivolous life?"

"You have come to the country for rest and recuperation, Miss Marian?"

"Oh, what a word,--'recuperation!' It never entered my head that I had come into the country
for that. Do I suggest a crying need for recuperation?"

"I wouldn't dare tell you all that you suggest to me, and I read more than you say between
your lines. When I approached the house you were chatting and laughing genially with your mother."

"Oh, yes, mamma and I have as jolly times together as two girls."

"That was evident, and it made a very pleasant impression on me. One thing is not so evident,
and it indicates a rather one-sided condition of affairs. I could not prevent my thoughts from
visiting you often to-day before I came myself, but I fear that among your June-day occupations
there has not been one thought of me."

She had only time to say, sotto voce, "Girls don't tell everything," when the maid announced,
from the door, "Mr. Strahan."

This second comer was a young man precociously mature after a certain style. His home was a
fine old place in the vicinity, but in his appearance there was no suggestion of the country;
nor did he resemble the violet, although he was somewhat redolent of the extract of that modest
flower. He was dressed in the extreme of the prevailing mode, and evidently cultivated a metropolitan
air, rather than the unobtrusive bearing of one who is so thoroughly a gentleman that he can
afford to be himself. Mr. Strahan was quite sure of his welcome, for he felt that he brought
to the little cottage a genuine Madison-avenue atmosphere. He was greeted with the cordiality
which made Miss Vosburgh's drawing-room one of the pleasantest of lounging-places, whether
in town or country; and under his voluble lead conversation took the character of fashionable
gossip, which would have for the reader as much interest as the presentation of some of the
ephemeral weeds of that period. But Mr. Strahan's blue eyes were really animated as he ventured
perilously near a recent scandal in high life. His budget of news was interspersed with compliments
to his hostess, which, like the extract on his handkerchief, were too pronounced. Mr. Lane
regarded him with politely veiled disgust, but was too well-bred not to second Miss Vosburgh's
remarks to the best of his ability.

Before long two or three more visitors dropped in. One from the hotel was a millionnaire, a
widower leisurely engaged in the selection of a second wife. Another was a young artist sketching
in the vicinity. A third was an officer from West Point who knew Mr.  Vosburgh. There were
also callers from the neighborhood during the evening. Mrs. Vosburgh made her appearance early,
and was almost as skilful a hostess as her daughter. But few of the guests remained long. They
had merely come to enjoy a pleasant half-hour or more under circumstances eminently agreeable,
and would then drive on and pay one or two visits in the vicinity. That was the way in which
nearly all Marian's "friendships" began.

The little parlor resounded with animated talk, laughter, and music, that was at the same time
as refined as informal. Mrs. Vosburgh would seat herself at the piano, that a new dancing-step
or a new song might be tried. The gentlemen were at liberty to light their cigars and form
groups among themselves, so free from stiffness was Marian's little salon. Brief time elapsed,
however, without a word to each, in her merry, girlish voice, for she had the instincts of
a successful hostess, and a good-natured sense of honor, which made her feel that each guest
was entitled to attention. She was not much given to satire, and the young men soon learned
that she would say more briery things to their faces than behind their backs. It was also discovered
that ill-natured remarks about callers who had just departed were not tolerated,--that within
certain limits she was loyal to her friends, and that, she was too high-minded to speak unhandsomely
of one whom she had just greeted cordially. If she did not like a man she speedily froze him
out of the ranks of her acquaintance; but for such action there was not often occasion, since
she and her mother had a broad, easy tolerance of those generally accepted by society. Even
such as left her parlor finally with wounds for which there was no rapid healing knew that
no one would resent a jest at their expense more promptly than the girl whom they might justly
blame for having smiled too kindly.

Thus she remained a general favorite. It was recognized that she had a certain kind of loyalty
which could be depended upon. Of course such a girl would eventually marry, and with natural
hope and egotism each one felt that he might be the successful competitor. At any rate, as
in war, they must take their chances, and it seems that there is never a lack of those willing
to assume such risks.

Thus far, however, Marian had no inclination to give up her present life of variety and excitement.
She preferred incense from many worshippers to the devotion of one. The secret of this was
perhaps that her heart had remained so untouched and unconscious that she scarcely knew she
had one. She understood the widower's preference, enjoyed the compliment, and should there
be occasion would, in perfect good taste, beg to be excused.

Her pulse was a little quickened by Mr. Lane's downright earnestness, and when matters should
come to a crisis she would say lovely things to him of her esteem, respect, regret, etc. She
would wish they might remain friends--why could they not, when she liked him so much? As for
love and engagement, she did not, could not, think of that yet.

She was skilful, too, in deferring such crises, and to-night, in obedience to a signal, Mrs.
Vosburgh remained until even Mr. Lane despaired of another word in private, and departed, fearing
to put his fate to the test.

At last the dainty apartment, the merry campaigning-ground, was darkened, and Marian, flushed,
wearied, and complacent, stepped out on the piazza to breathe for a few moments the cool, fragrant
air.  She had dropped into a rustic seat, and was thinking over the events of the evening with
an amused smile, when the following startling words arose from the adjacent shrubbery:--

"Arrah, noo, will ye niver be sinsible? Here I'm offerin' ye me heart, me loife. I'd be glad
to wourk for ye, and kape ye loike a leddy. I'd be thrue to ye ivery day o' me loife,--an'
ye knows it, but ye jist goes on makin' eyes at this wan an' flirtin' wid that wan an' spakin'
swate to the t'other, an' kapin' all on the string till they can nayther ate nor slape nor
be half the min they were till ye bewildered 'em. Ye're nothin' but a giddy, light-minded,
shallow crather, a spoilin' min for your own fun. I've kep' company wid ye a year, and ye've
jist blowed hot and cowld till I'm not meself any more, and have come nigh losin' me place.
Noo, by St. Patrick, ye must show whether ye're a woman or a heartless jade that will sind
a man to the divil for sport."

These words were poured out with the impetuosity of longsuffering endurance finally vanquished,
and before the speaker had concluded Marian was on her way to the door, that she might not
listen to a conversation of so delicate a nature. But she did not pass beyond hearing before
part of the reply reached her.

"Faix, an' I'm no wourse than me young mistress."

It was a chance arrow, but it went straight to the mark, aad when Marian reached her room her
cheeks were aflame.

CHAPTER II.

A NEW ACQUAINTANCE.

Gross matter can change form and character in a moment, when merely touched by the effective
agent. It is easy to imagine, therefore, how readily a woman's quick mind might be influenced
by a truth or a thought of practical and direct application. All the homilies ever written,
all the counsel of matrons and sages, could not have produced on Marian so deep an impression
as was made by these few chance words. They came as a commentary, not only on her past life,
but on the past few hours. Was it true, then, that she was no better than the coquettish maid,
the Irish servant in the family's employ?  Was she, with her education and accomplishments,
her social position and natural gifts, acting on no higher plane, influenced by no worthier
motives and no loftier ambition? Was the ignorant girl justified in quoting her example in
extenuation of a course that to a plain and equally ignorant man seemed unwomanly to the last
degree?

Wherein was she better? Wherein lay the difference between her and the maid?

She covered her hot face with her hands as the question took the form: "Wherein am I worse?
Is not our principle of action the same, while I have greater power and have been crippling
higher types of men, and giving them, for sport, an impulse towards the devil? Fenton Lane
has just gone from my side with trouble in his eyes. He will not be himself to-morrow, not
half the man he might be. He left me in doubt and fear. Could I do anything oppressed with
doubt and fear? He has set his heart on what can never be. Could I have prevented him from
doing this? One thing at least is certain,--I have not tried to prevent it, and I fear there
have been many little nameless things which he would regard as encouragement. And he is only
one. With others I have gone farther and they have fared worse.  It is said that Mr. Folger,
whom I refused last winter, is becoming dissipated. Mr. Arton shuns society and sneers at women.
Oh, don't let me think of any more. What have I been doing that this coarse kitchen-maid can
run so close a parallel between her life and mine?  How unwomanly and repulsive it all seems,
as that man put it! My delight and pride have been my gentleman friends, and what one of them
is the better, or has a better prospect for life, because of having known me? Could there be
a worse satire on all the fine things written about woman and her influence than my hitherto
vain and complacent self?"

Sooner or later conscience tells the truth to all; and the sooner the better, unless the soul
arraigned is utterly weak, or else belongs essentially to the criminal classes, which require
almost a miracle to reverse their evil gravitation. Marian Vosburgh was neither weak nor criminal
at heart. Thus far she had yielded thoughtlessly, inconsiderately, rather than deliberately,
to the circumstances and traditions of her life. Her mother had been a belle and something
of a coquette, and, having had her career, was in the main a good and sensible wife. She had
given her husband little trouble if not much help. She had slight interest in that which made
his life, and slight comprehension of it, but in affectionate indifference she let him go his
way, and was content with her domestic affairs, her daughter, and her novel. Marian had unthinkingly
looked forward to much the same experience as her natural lot. To-night she found herself querying:
"Are there men to-day who are not half what they might have been because of mamma's delusive
smiles? Have any gone down into shadows darker than those cast by misfortune and death, because
she permitted herself to become the light of their lives and then turned away?"

Then came the rather painful reflection: "Mamma is not one to be troubled by such thoughts.
It does not even worry her that she is so little to papa, and that he virtually carries on
his life-work alone. I don't see how I can continue my old life after to-night. I had better
shut myself up in a convent; yet just how I can change everything I scarcely know."

The night proved a perturbed and almost sleepless one from the chaos and bitterness of her
thoughts. The old was breaking up; the new, beginning.

The morning found her listless, discontented, and unhappy. The glamour had faded out of her
former life. She could not continue the tactics practised in coarse imitation by the Irish
servant, who took her cue as far as possible from her mistress. The repugnance was due as much
to the innate delicacy and natural superiority of Marian's nature as to her conscience. Her
clear, practical sense perceived that her course differed from the other only in being veneered
by the refinements of her social position,--that the evil results were much greater. The young
lady's friends were capable of receiving more harm than the maid could inflict upon her acquaintances.

There would be callers again during the day and evening, and she did not wish to see them.
Their society now would be like a glass of champagne from which the life had effervesced.

At last in her restlessness and perplexity she decided to spend a day or two with her father
in their city home, where he was camping out, as he termed it. She took a train to town, and
sent a messenger boy to his office with a note asking him to dine with her.

Mr. Vosburgh looked at her a little inquiringly as he entered his home, which had the comfortless
aspect of a city house closed for the summer.

"Am I de trop, papa? I have come to town for a little quiet, and to do some shopping."

"Come to New York for quiet?"

"Yes. The country is the gayest place now, and you know a good many are coming and going. I
am tired, and thought an evening or two with you would be a pleasant change. You are not too busy?"

"It certainly will be a change for you, Marian."

"Now there's a world of satire in that remark, and deserved, too, I fear. Mayn't I stay?"

"Yes, indeed, till you are tired of me; and that won't be long in this dull place, for we are
scarcely in a condition now to receive callers, you know."

"What makes you think I shall be tired of you soon, papa?"

"Oh--well--I'm not very entertaining. You appear to like variety. I suppose it is the way with
girls."

"You are not consumed with admiration for girls' ways, are you, papa?"

"I confess, my dear, that I have not given the subject much research. As a naturalist would
say, I have no doubt that you and your class have curious habits and interesting peculiarities.
There is a great deal of life, you know, which a busy man has to accept in a general way, especially
when charged with duties which are a severe and constant strain upon his mind. I try to leave
you and your mother as free from care as possible. You left her well, I trust?"

"Very well, and all going on as usual. I'm dissatisfied with myself, papa, and you unconsciously
make me far more so. Is a woman to be only a man's plaything, and a dangerous one at that?"

"Why, Marian, you ARE in a mood! I suppose a woman, like a man, can be very much what she pleases.
You certainly have had a chance to find out what pleases most women in your circle of acquaintances,
and have made it quite clear what pleases you."

"Satire again," she said, despondently. "I thought perhaps you could advise and help me."

He came and took her face between his hands, looking earnestly into her troubled blue eyes.

"Are you not content to be a conventional woman?" he asked, after a moment.

"No!" was her emphatic answer.

"Well, there are many ways of being a little outre in this age and land, especially at this
stormy period. Perhaps you want a career,--something that will give you a larger place in the
public eye?"

She turned away to hide the tears that would come. "O papa, you don't understand me at all,
and I scarcely understand myself," she faltered. "In some respects you are as conventional
as mamma, and are almost a Turk in your ideas of the seclusion of women. The idea of my wanting
public notoriety! As I feel now, I'd rather go to a convent."

"We'll go to dinner first; then a short drive in the park, for you look pale, and I long for
a little fresh air myself. I have been at my desk since seven this morning, and have had only
a sandwich."

"Why do you have to work so hard, papa?"

"I can give you two reasons in a breath,--you mentioned 'shopping,' and my country is at war.
They don't seem very near of kin, do they?  Documents relating to both converge in my desk,
however."

"Have I sent you more bills than usual?"

"Not more than usual."

"I believe I'm a fool."

"I know you are a very pretty little girl, who will feel better after dinner and a drive,"
was the laughing reply.

They were soon seated in a quiet family restaurant, but the young girl was too perturbed in
mind to enjoy the few courses ordered. With self-reproach she recognized the truth that she
was engaged in the rather unusual occupation of becoming acquainted with her father. He sat
before her, with his face, generally stern and inscrutable, softened by a desire to be companionable
and sympathetic. According to his belief she now had "a mood," and after a day or two of quiet
retirement from the world she would relapse into her old enjoyment of social attention, which
would be all the deeper for its brief interruption.

Mr. Vosburgh was of German descent. In his daily life he had become Americanized, and was as
practical in his methods as the shrewd people with whom he dealt, and whom he often outwitted.
Apart from this habit of coping with life just as he found it, he had an inner nature of which
few ever caught a glimpse,--a spirit and an imagination deeply tinged with German ideality
and speculation. Often, when others slept, this man, who appeared so resolute, hard, and uncompromising
in the performance of duties, and who was understood by but few, would read deeply in metaphysics
and romantic poetry. Therefore, the men and women who dwelt in his imagination were not such
as he had much to do with in real life. Indeed, he had come to regard the world of reality
and that of fancy as entirely distinct, and to believe that only here and there, as a man or
woman possessed something like genius, would there be a marked deviation from ordinary types.
The slight differences, the little characteristic meannesses or felicities that distinguished
one from another, did not count for very much in his estimation. When a knowledge of such individual
traits was essential to his plans, he mastered them with singular keenness and quickness of
comprehension.  When such knowledge was unnecessary, or as soon as it ceased to be of service,
he dismissed the extraneous personalities from his mind almost as completely as if they had
had no existence. Few men were less embarrassed with acquaintances than he; yet he had an observant
eye and a retentive memory. When he wanted a man he rarely failed to find the right one. In
the selection and use of men he appeared to act like an intelligent and silent force, rather
than as a man full of human interests and sympathies. He rarely spoke of himself, even in the
most casual way. Most of those with whom he mingled knew merely that he was an agent of the
government, and that he kept his own counsel. His wife was to him a type of the average American
woman,--pretty, self-complacent, so nervous as to require kind, even treatment, content with
feminalities, and sufficiently intelligent to talk well upon every-day affairs. In her society
he smiled at her, said "Yes," good-humoredly, to almost everything, and found slight incentive
to depart from his usual reticence. She had learned the limits of her range, and knew that
within it there was entire liberty, beyond it a will like adamant. They got on admirably together,
for she craved nothing further in the way of liberty and companionship than was accorded her,
while he soon recognized that the prize carried off from other competitors could no more follow
him into his realm of thought and action than she could accompany him on a campaign. At last
he had concluded philosophically that it was just as well. He was engaged in matters that should
not be interfered with or babbled about, and he could come and go without questioning. He had
occasionally thought: "If she were such a woman as I have read of and imagined,--if she could
supplement my reason with the subtilty of intuition and the reticence which some of her sex
have manifested,--she would double my power and share my inner life, for there are few whom
I can trust. The thing is impossible, however, and so I am glad she is content."

As for Marian, she had promised, in his view, to be but a charming repetition of her mother,
with perhaps a mind of larger calibre. She had learned more and had acquired more accomplishments,
but all this resulted, possibly, from her better advantages. Her drawing-room conversation
seemed little more than the ordinary small talk of the day, fluent and piquant, while the girl
herself was as undisturbed by the vital questions of the hour and of life, upon which he dwelt,
as if she had been a child. He knew that she received much attention, but it excited little
thought on his part, and no surprise. He believed that her mother was perfectly competent to
look after the proprieties, and that young fellows, as had been the case with himself, would
always seek pretty, well-bred girls, and take their chances as to what the women who might
become their wives should prove to be.

Marian looked with awakening curiosity and interest at the face before her, yet it was the
familiar visage of her father. She had seen it all her life, but now felt that she had never
before seen it in its true significance--its strong lines, square jaw, and quiet gray eyes,
with their direct, steady gaze. He had come and gone before her daily, petted her now and then
a little, met her requests in the main good-humoredly, paid her bills, and would protect her
with his life; yet a sort of dull wonder came over her as she admitted to herself that he was
a stranger to her. She knew little of his work and duty, less of his thoughts, the mental realm
in which the man himself dwelt. What were its landmarks, what its characteristic features,
she could not tell. One may be familiar with the outlines of a country on a map, yet be ignorant
of the scenery, productions, inhabitants, governing forces, and principles. Her very father
was to her but a man in outline. She knew little of the thoughts that peopled his brain, of
the motives and principles that controlled his existence, giving it individuality, and even
less of the resulting action with which his busy life abounded. Although she had crossed the
threshold of womanhood, she was still to him the self-pleasing child that he had provided for
since infancy; and he was, in her view, the man to whom, according to the law of nature and
the family, she was to look for the maintenance of her young life, with its almost entire separation
in thoughts, pleasures, and interests. She loved him, of course. She had always loved him,
from the time when she had stretched forth her baby hands to be taken and fondled for a few
moments and then relinquished to others. Practically she had dwelt with others ever since.
Now, as a result, she did not understand him, nor he her. She would miss him as she would oxygen
from the air. Now she began to perceive that, although he was the unobtrusive source of her
life, home, education, and the advantages of her lot, he was not impersonal, but a human being
as truly as herself. Did he want more from her than the common and instinctive affection of
a child for its parent? If to this she added intelligent love, appreciation, and sympathy,
would he care?  If she should be able to say, "Papa, I am kin to you, not merely in flesh and
blood, but in mind, hope, and aspiration; I share with you that which makes your life, with
its success and failure, not as the child who may find luxurious externals curtailed or increased,
but as a sympathetic woman who understands the more vital changes in spiritual vicissitude,"--if
she could truthfully say all this, would he be pleased and reveal himself to her?

Thoughts like these passed through her mind as they dined together and drove in the park. When
at last they returned and sat in the dimly-lighted parlor, Mr. Vosburgh recognized that her
"mood" had not passed away.

CHAPTER III.

A NEW FRIEND.

"MARIAN," asked her father, after smoking awhile in silence, "what did you mean by your emphatic
negative when I asked you if you were not content to be a conventional woman? How much do you
mean?"

"I wish you would help me find out, papa."

"How! don't you know?"

"I do not; I am all at sea."

"Well, my dear, to borrow your own illustration, you can't be far from shore yet. Why not return?
You have seemed entirely satisfied thus far."

"Were you content with me, papa?"

"I think you have been a very good little girl, as girls go."

"'Good little girl, as girls go;' that's all."

"That's more than can be said of many."

"Papa, I'm not a little girl; I am a woman of twenty years."

"Yes, I know; and quite as sensible as many at forty."

"I am no companion for you."

"Indeed you are; I've enjoyed having you with me this evening exceedingly."

"Yes, as you would have enjoyed my society ten years ago. I've been but a little girl to you
all the time. Do you know the thought that has been uppermost in my mind since you joined me?"

"How should I? How long does one thought remain uppermost in a girl's mind?"

"I don't blame you for your estimate. My thought is this,--we are not acquainted with each other."

"I think I was acquainted with you, Marian, before this mood began."

"Yes, I think you were; yet I was capable of this 'mood,' as you call it, before."

"My child," said Mr. Vosburgh, coming to her side and stroking her hair, "I have spoken more
to draw you out than for anything else. Heaven forbid that you for a moment should think me
indifferent to anything that relates to your welfare! You wish me to advise, to help you. Before
I can do this I must have your confidence, I must know your thoughts and impulses. You can
scarcely have a purpose yet. Even a quack doctor will not attempt diagnosis or prescribe his
nostrum without some knowledge of the symptoms. When I last saw you in the country you certainly
appeared like a conventional society girl of an attractive type, and were evidently satisfied
so to remain. You see I speak frankly, and reveal to you my habit of making quick practical
estimates, and of taking the world as I find it. You say you were capable of this mood--let
us call it an aspiration--before. I do not deny this, yet doubt it. When people change it is
because they are ripe, or ready for change, as are things in nature. One can force or retard
nature; but I don't believe much in intervention. With many I doubt whether there is even much
opportunity for it. They are capable of only the gradual modification of time and circumstances.
Young people are apt to have spasms of enthusiasm, or of self-reproach and dissatisfaction.
These are of little account in the long run, unless there is fibre enough in character to face
certain questions, decide them, and then act resolutely on definite lines of conduct. I have
now given you my views, not as to a little child, but as to a mature woman of twenty.  Jesting
apart, you ARE old enough, Marian, to think for yourself, and decide whether you will be conventional
or not. The probabilities are that you will follow the traditions of your past in a very ladylike
way. That is the common law. You are too well-bred and refined to do anything that society
would condemn."

"You are not encouraging, papa."

"Nor am I discouraging. If you have within you the force to break from your traditions and
stop drifting, you will make the fact evident. If you haven't it would be useless for me to
attempt to drag, drive, or coax you out of old ways. I am too busy a man to attempt the useless.
But until you tell me your present mental attitude, and what has led to it, we are talking
somewhat at random. I have merely aimed to give you the benefit of some experience."

"Perhaps you are taking the right course; I rather think you are. Perhaps I prove what a child
I am still, because I feel that I should like to have you treat me more as you did when I was
learning to walk. Then you stretched out your hands, and sustained me, and showed me step by
step. Papa, if this is a mood, and I go back to my old, shallow life, with its motives, its
petty and unworthy triumphs, I shall despise myself, and ever have the humiliating consciousness
that I am doing what is contemptible. No matter how one obtains the knowledge of a truth or
a secret, that knowledge exists, remains, and one can't be the same afterwards. It makes my
cheeks tingle that I obtained my knowledge as I did. It came like a broad glare of garish light,
in which I saw myself;" and she told him the circumstances.

He burst into a hearty laugh, and remarked, "Pat did put the ethics of the thing strongly."

"He made 'the thing,' as you call it, odious then and forever. I've been writhing in self-contempt
ever since. When to be conventional is to be like a kitchen-maid, and worse, do you wonder
at my revolt from the past?"

"Others won't see it in that light, my dear."

"What does it matter how others see it? I have my own life to live, to make or mar. How can
I go on hereafter amusing myself in what now seems a vulgar, base, unwomanly way? It was a
coarse, rude hand that awakened me, papa, but I am awake. Since I have met you I have had another
humiliation. As I said, I am not even acquainted with you. I have never shown any genuine interest
in that which makes your life, and you have no more thought of revealing yourself and your
work to me than to a child."

"Marian," said her father, slowly, "I think you are not only capable of a change, but ripe
for it. You inspire hope within me, and this fact carries with it the assurance that you also
inspire respect. No, my dear, you don't know much about me; very few do. No man with a nature
like mine reveals himself where there is no desire for the knowledge, no understanding, no
sympathy, or even where all these exist, unless prompted by his heart. You know I am the last
one in the world to put myself on exhibition. But it would be a heavenly joy to me--I might
add surprise--if my own daughter became like some of the women of whom I have read and dreamed;
and I do read and dream of that in which you little imagine me to be interested. To the world
I am a stern, reticent, practical man I must be such in my calling. In my home I have tried
to be good-natured, affectionate, and philosophical. I have seen little opportunity for anything
more.  I do not complain, but merely state a fact which indicates the general lot. We can rarely
escape the law of heredity, however. A poet and a metaphysician were among our German ancestry;
therefore, leading from the business-like and matter-of-fact apartment of my mind, I have a
private door by which I can slip away into the realm of speculation, romance, and ideals. You
perceive that I have no unnatural or shame-faced reticence about this habit. I tell you of
it the moment you show sufficient interest to warrant my speaking."

"But, papa, I cannot hope to approach or even suggest the ideals of your fancy, dressed, no
doubt, in mediaeval costume, and talking in blank verse."

"That's a superficial view, Marian. Neither poetic or outlandish costume, nor the impossible
language put into the mouths of their creations by the old bards, makes the unconventional
woman. There is, in truth, a conventionality about these very things, only it is antiquated.
It is not a woman's dress or phraseology that makes her an ideal or an inspiration, but what
she is herself. No two leaves are alike on the same tree, but they are all enough alike to
make but one impression. Some are more shapely than others, and flutter from their support
with a fairer and more conspicuous grace to the closely observant; but there is nothing independent
about them, nothing to distinguish them especially from their companions. They fulfil their
general purpose, and fall away. This simile applies to the majority of people. Not only poetry
and romance, but history also, gives us instances wherein men and women differ and break away
from accepted types, some in absurd or grotesque ways, others through the sheer force of gifted
selfishness, and others still in natural, noble development of graces of heart and mind."

"Stop generalizing, and tell me, your silly, vain, flirtatious daughter, how I can be unconventional
in this prosaic midday of civilization."

"Prosaic day? You are mistaken, Marian. There never was a period like it Barbaric principles,
older than Abraham, are now to triumph, or give place to a better and more enlightened human
nature. We almost at this moment hear the echoes of a strife in which specimens of the best
manhood of the age are arrayed against one another in a struggle such as the world has never
witnessed. I have my part in the conflict, and it brings to me great responsibilities and dangers."

"Dangers! You in danger, papa?"

"Yes, certainly. Since you wish to be treated like a woman, and not a child,--since you wish
me to show my real life,--you shall know the truth. I am controlled by the government that
is engaged in a life-and-death struggle to maintain its own existence and preserve for the
nation its heritage of liberty. Thus far I have been able to serve the cause in quiet, unrecognized
ways that I need not now explain; but I am one who must obey orders, and I wish to do so, for
my heart is in the work. I am no better than other men who are risking all. Mamma knows this
in a way, but she does not fully comprehend it. Fortunately she is not one of those who take
very anxious thought for the morrow, and you know I am inclined to let things go on quietly
as long as they will. Thus far I have merely gone to an office as I did before the war, or
else have been absent on trips that were apparently civilian in character, and it has been
essential that I should have as little distraction of mind as possible. I have lived long in
hope that some decisive victory might occur; but the future grows darker, instead of lighter,
and the struggle, instead of culminating speedily, promises to become more deadly and to be
prolonged. There is but one way out of it for me, and that is through the final triumph of
the old flag. Therefore, what a day will bring forth God only knows. There have been times
when I wished to tell you something of this, but there seemed little opportunity. As you said,
a good many were coming and going, you seemed happy and preoccupied, and I got into the habit
of reasoning, 'Every day that passes without a thought of trouble is just so much gained; and
it may be unnecessary to cloud her life with fear and anxiety;' yet perhaps it would be mistaken
kindness to let trouble come suddenly, like an unexpected blow. I confess, however, that I
have had a little natural longing to be more to my only child than I apparently was, but each
day brought its increasing press of work and responsibility, its perplexing and far-reaching
questions. Thus time has passed, and I said, 'Let her be a light-hearted girl as long as she can.'"

"O papa, what a blind, heartless fool I've been!"

"No, my dear, only young and thoughtless, like thousands of others.  It so happened that nothing
occurred to awaken you. One day of your old life begat another. That so slight a thing should
make you think, and desire to be different, promises much to me, for if your nature had been
shallow and commonplace, you wouldn't have been much disturbed. If you have the spirit your
words indicate to-night, it will be better for you to face life in the height and depth of
its reality, trusting in God and your own womanhood for strength to meet whatever comes. Those
who live on this higher plane have deeper sorrows, but also far richer joys, than those who
exist from hand to mouth, as it were, in the immediate and material present. What's more, they
cease to be plebeian in the meaner sense of the word, and achieve at one step a higher caste.
They have broken the conventional type, and all the possibilities of development open at once.
You are still a young, inexperienced girl, and have done little in life except learn your lessons
and amuse yourself, yet in your dissatisfaction and aspiration you are almost infinitely removed
from what you were yesterday, for you have attained the power to grow and develop."

"You are too philosophical for me. How shall I grow or develop?"

"I scarcely know."

"What definite thing shall I do to-morrow?"

"Do what the plant does. Receive the influence that tends to quicken your best impulses and
purposes; follow your awakened conscience naturally. Do what seems to you womanly, right, noble
in little things or in great things, should there be opportunity. Did Shakespeare, as a child,
propose to write the plays which have made him chief among men? He merely yielded to the impulse
when it came.  The law holds good down to you, my little girl. You have an impulse which is
akin to that of genius. Instead of continuing your old indolent, strolling gait on the dead
level of life, you have left the beaten track and faced the mountain of achievement. Every
resolute step forward takes you higher, even though it be but an inch; yet I cannot see the
path by which you will climb, or tell you the height you may gain. The main thing is the purpose
to ascend.  For ihose bent on noble achievement there is always a path. God only knows to what
it may bring you. One step leads to another, and you will be guided better by the instincts
and laws of your own nature than if I tried to lead you step by step. The best I can do is
to give you a little counsel, and a helping hand now and then, as the occasion requires."

"Now in truth, papa, do not all your fine words signify about what you and mamma used to say
years ago,--'You must be a good little girl, and then you will be happy'? It seems to me that
many good people are conventionality itself."

"Many are, and if they ARE good, it is a fortunate phase of conventionality. For instance,
I know of a man who by the law of heredity and the force of circumstances has scarcely a bad
habit or trait, and has many good ones. He meets the duties of life in an ordinary, satisfactory
way, and with little effort on his part I know of another man who externally presents nearly
the same aspect to society, who is quiet and unobtrusive in his daily life, and yet he is fighting
hereditary taint and habit with a daily heroism, such as no soldier in the war can surpass.
He is not conventional, although he appears to be so. He is a knight who is not afraid to face
demons. Genuine strength and originality of character do not consist in saying or doing things
in an unusual way. Voluntary eccentrics are even worse than the imitators of some model or
the careless souls which take .their coloring from chance surroundings. Conventionality ceases
when a human being begins the resolute development of his own. natural law of growth to the
utmost extent. This is true because nature in her higher work is not stereotyped. I will now
be as definite as you can desire. You, for instance, Marian Vosburgh, are as yet, even to yourself,
an unknown quantity. You scarcely know what you are, much less what you may become. This conversation,
and the feeling which led to it, prove this. There are traits and possibilities in your nature
due to ancestors of whom you have not even heard. These combine with your own individual endowments
by nature to make you a separate and distinct being, and you grow more separate and distinct
by developing nature's gifts, traits, powers,--in brief, that which is essentially your own.
Thus nature becomes your ally and sees to it with absolute certainty that you are not like
other people. Following this principle of action you cannot know, nor can any one know, to
just what you may attain. All true growth is from within, outward. In the tree, natural law
prevents distortion or exaggeration of one part over another. In your case reason, conscience,
good taste, must supervise and direct natural impulses. Thus following nature you become natural,
and cease to be conventional. If you don't do this you will be either conventional or queer.
Do you understand me?"

"I think I begin to. Let me see if I do. Let me apply your words to one definite problem,--How
can I be more helpful and companionable to you?"

"Why, Marian, do you not see how infinitely more to me you are already, although scarcely beyond
the wish to be different from what you were? I have talked to you as a man talks to a woman
in the dearest and most unselfish relation of life. There is one thing, however, you never
can know, and that is a father's love for a daughter: it is essentially a man's love and a
man's experience. I am sure it is very different from the affection I should have for a son,
did I possess one. Ever since you were a baby the phrase, 'my little girl,' has meant more
than you can ever know; and now when you come voluntarily to my side in genuine sympathy, and
seek to enter INTELLIGENTLY into that which makes my life, you change everything for the better,
precisely as that which was in cold, gray shadow before is changed by sunlight. You add just
so much by your young, fresh, womanly life to my life, and it is all the more welcome because
it is womanly and different from mine. You cease to be a child, a dependant to be provided
for, and become a friend, an inspiration, a confidante. These relations may count little to
heavy, stolid, selfish men, to whom eating, drinking, excitement, and money-making are the
chief considerations, but to men of mind and ideals, especially to a man who has devoted, his
heart, brain, and life to a cause upon which the future of a nation depends, they are pre-eminent.
You see I am a German at heart, and must have my world of thought and imagination, as well
as the world in which men look at me with cold, hard, and even hostile eyes. Thus far this
ideal world has been peopled chiefly by the shadows of those who have lived in the past or
by the characters of the great creators in poetry. Now if my blue-eyed daughter can prove to
me that she has too much heart and brain to be an ordinary society-girl like half a million
of others, and will share my interest in the great thoughts and achievements of the past and
the greater questions of to-day,--if she can prove that when I have time I may enjoy a tryst
with her in regions far remote from shallow, coarse, commonplace minds,--is not my whole life
enriched? We can read some of my favorite authors together and trace their influence on the
thought of the world. We can take up history and see how to-day's struggle is the result of
the past. I think I could soon give you an intelligent idea of the questions of the time, for
which men are hourly dying. The line of battle stretches across the continent, and so many
are engaged that every few moments a man, and too often a woman from heart-break, dies that
the beloved cause may triumph. Southern girls and women, as a rule, are far more awake to the
events of the time than their sisters in the North. Such an influence on the struggle can scarcely
be over-estimated. They create a public sentiment that drives even the cowardly into the ranks,
and their words and enthusiasm incite brave young men to even chivalric courage. It is true
that there are very many like them in the North, but there are also very many who restrain
the men over whom they have influence,--who are indifferent, as you have been, or in sympathy
with the South,--or who, as is true in most instances, do not yet see the necessity for self-sacrifice.
We have not truly felt the war yet, but it will sooner or later come home to every one who
has a heart. I have been in the South, and have studied the spirit of the people. They are
just as sincere and conscientious as we are, and more in earnest as yet. Christian love and
faith, there, look to Heaven for sanction with absolute sincerity, and mothers send their sons,
girls their lovers, and wives their husbands, to die if need be. For the political conspirators
who have thought first and always of their ambition I have only detestation, but for the people
of the South--for the man I may meet in the ranks and kill if I can--I have profound respect.
I should know he was wrong, I should be equally sure that he believed himself right.

"Look at the clock, my dear, and see how long I have talked to you.  Can you now doubt that
you will be companionable to me? Men down town think I am hard as a rock, but your touch of
sympathy has been as potent as the stroke of Moses' rod. You have had an inundation of words,
and the future is rosy to me with hope because you are not asleep."

"Have I shown lack of interest, papa?"

"No, Marian, your intent eyes have been eloquent with feeling. Therefore I have spoken so long
and fully. You have, as it were, drawn the words from me. You have made this outpouring of
my heart seem as natural as breathing, for when you look as you do to-night, I can almost think
aloud to you. You have a sympathetic face, my child, and when expressing intelligent sympathy
it grows beautiful. It was only pretty before. Prettiness is merely a thing of outline and
color; beauty comes from the soul."

She came and stood at his side, resting her arm lightly on his shoulder.

"Papa," she said, "your words are a revelation to me. Your world is indeed a new one, and a
better one than mine. But I must cease to be a girl, and become a woman, to enter it."

"You need not be less happy; you do not loset anything. A picture is ever finer for shadows
and depth of perspective. You can't get anything very fine, in either art or life, from mere
bright surface glare."

"I can't go back to that any more; something in my very soul tells me that I cannot; and your
loneliness and danger would render even the wish to do so base. No, I feel now that I would
rather be a woman, even though it involves a crown of thorns, than to be a shallow creature
that my own heart would despise. I may never be either wise or deep, but I shall be to you
all I can."

"You do very much for me in those words alone, my darling. As I said before, no one can tell
what you may become if you develop your own nature naturally."

CHAPTER IV.

WOMAN'S CHIEF RIGHT.

It was late when Marian and her father parted, and each felt that a new era had begun in their
lives. To the former it was like a deep religious experience. She was awed and somewhat depressed,
as well as resolute and earnest. Life was no pleasure excursion to her father. Questions involving
the solemnity of danger, possibly death, occupied his mind. Yet it was not of either that he
thought, but of the questions themselves. She saw that he was a large-hearted, large-brained
man, who entered into the best spirit of his age, and found recreation in the best thought
of the past, and she felt that she was still but a little child beside him.

"But I shall no longer be a silly child or a shallow, selfish, unfeeling girl. I know there
is something better in my nature than this. Papa's words confirm what I have read but never
thought of much: the chief need of men who can do much or who amount to much is the intelligent
sympathy of women who understand and care for them.  Why, it was the inspiration of chivalry,
even in the dark ages.  Well, Marian Vosburgh, if you can't excel a kitchen-maid, it would
be better that you had never lived."

The sun was shining brightly when she wakened on the following morning, and when she came to
breakfast their domestic handed her a note from her father, by which she was informed that
he would dine with her earlier than usual, and that they would take a sail down the bay.

Brief as it was, it breathed an almost lover-like fondness and happiness. She enjoyed her first
exultant thrill at her sense of power as she comprehended that he had gone to his work that
day a stronger and more hopeful man.

She went out to do her shopping, and was soon in a Broadway temple of fashion, but found that
she was no longer a worshipper. A week before the beautiful fabrics would have absorbed her
mind and awakened intense desires, for she had a passion for dress, and few knew how to make
more of it than she. But a new and stronger passion was awakening. She was made to feel at
last that she had not only a woman's lovely form and features, but a woman's mind. Now she
began to dream of triumphs through the latter, and her growing thought was how to achieve them.
Not that she was indifferent to her costume; it should be like the soldier's accoutrements;
her mind the weapon.

As is common with the young to whom any great impulse or new, deep experience comes, she was
absorbed by it, and could think of little else. She went over her father's words again and
again, dwelling on the last utterance, which had contained the truth uppermost in all that
he had said,--"Develop the best in your own nature naturally."

What was her own nature, her starting-point? Her introspection was not very reassuring. She
felt that perhaps the most hopeful indication was her strong rebound from what she at last
recognized as mean and unworthy. She also had a little natural curiosity and vanity to see
if her face was changing with changing motives. Was there such a difference between prettiness
and beauty? She was perfectly sure she would rather be beautiful than pretty.

Her mirror revealed a perplexed young face, suggesting interrogation-points. The day was ending
as it had begun, with a dissatisfaction as to the past, amounting almost to disgust, and with
fears, queries, and uncertainties concerning the future. How should she take up life again?
How should she go on with it?

More importunate still was the question, "What has the future in store for me and for those
I love? Papa spoke of danger; and when I think of his resolute face, I know that nothing in
the line of duty will daunt him. He said that it might not be kindness to leave me in my old,
blind, unthinking ignorance,--that a blow, shattering everything, might come, finding us all
unprepared. Oh, why don't mamma feel and see more? We have been just like comfortable passengers
on a ship, while papa was facing we knew not what. I may not be of much use, but I feel now
as if I wanted to be with him. To stay below with scarcely any other motive than to have a
good time, and then to be paralyzed, helpless, when some shock of trouble comes, now seems
silly and weak to the last degree. I am only too glad that I came to my senses in time, for
if anything should happen to papa, and I had to remember all my days that I had never been
much to him, and had left him to meet the stress of life and danger alone, I am sure I should
be wretched from self-reproach."

When he came at six o'clock, she met him eagerly, and almost her first words were, "Papa, there
hasn't been any danger to-day?"

"Oh, no; none at all; only humdrum work. You must not anticipate trouble. Soldiers, you know,
jest and laugh even when going into battle, and they are all the better soldiers for the fact.
No; I have given you a wrong impression. Nothing has been humdrum to-day. An acquaintance down
town said: 'What's up, Vosburgh? Heard good news? Have our troops scored a point?' You see
I was so brightened up that he thought nothing but a national victory could account for the
improvement. Men are like armies, and are twice as effective when well supported."

"The idea of my supporting you!"

"To me it's a charming idea. Instead of coming back to a dismal, empty house, I find a blue-eyed
lassie who will go with me to dinner, and add sauce piquante to every dish. Come, I am not
such a dull, grave old fellow as you imagine. You shall see how gallant I can become under
provocation. We must make the most of a couple of hours, for that is all that I can give you.
No sail to-night, as I had planned, for a government agent is coming on from Washington to
see me, and I must be absent for at least an hour or two after eight o'clock. You won't mope,
will you? You have something to read? Has the day been very long and lonely? What have you
been doing and thinking about?"

"When are you going to give me a chance to answer?"

"Oh, I read your answer, partly at least, in your eyes. You can amplify later. Come, get ready
for the street. Put on what you please, so that you wear a smile. These are not times to worry
over slight reverses as long as the vital points are safe."

The hour they passed at dinner gave Marian a new revelation of her father. The quiet man proved
true the words of Emerson, "Among those who enjoy his thought, he will regain his tongue."

At first he drew her out a little, and with his keen, quick insight he understood her perplexity,
her solicitude about him and herself and the future, her resolute purpose to be a woman, and
the difficulties of seeing the way to the changes she desired. Instead of replying directly
to her words, he skilfully led their talk to the events of the day, and contemporaneous history
became romance under his version; the actors in the passing drama ceased to be names and officials,
and were invested with human interest. She was made to see their motives, their hopes, fears,
ambitions; she opened her eyes in surprise at his knowledge of prominent people, their social
status, relations, and family connection. A genial light of human interest played over most
of his words, yet now and then they touched on the depths of tragedy; again he seemed to be
indulging in sublimated gossip, and she saw the men and women who posed before the public in
their high stations revealed in their actual daily life.

She became so interested that at times she left her food untasted. "How can you know all this?"
she exclaimed.

"It is my business to know a great deal," he replied. "Then natural curiosity leads me to learn
more. The people of whom I have spoken are the animated pieces on the chess-board. In the tremendous
game that we are playing, success depends largely on their strength, weakness, various traits,--in
brief, their character. The stake that I have in the game leads me to know and watch those
who are exerting a positive influence. It is interesting to study the men and women who, in
any period, made and shaped history, and to learn the secrets of their success and failure.
Is it not natural that men and women who are making history to-day--who in fact are shaping
one's own history--should be objects of stronger attention? Now, as in the past, women exert
a far greater influence on current events than you would imagine. There are but few thrones
of power behind which you will not find a woman. What I shall do or be during the coming weeks
and months depends upon some of the people I have sketched, free-handed, for you alone. You
see the sphinx--for as such I am regarded by many--opens his mouth freely to you. Can you guess
some of my motives for this kind of talk?"

"You have wanted to entertain me, papa, and you have succeeded. You should write romances,
for you but touch the names one sees in the papers and they become dramatic actors."

"I did want to entertain you and make a fair return for your society; I wish to prove that
I can be your companion as truly as you can become mine; but I have aimed to do more. I wish
you to realize how interesting the larger and higher world of activity is. Do not imagine that
in becoming a woman, earnest and thoughtful, you are entering on an era of solemn platitudes.
You are rather passing from a theatre of light comedy to a stage from which Shakespeare borrowed
the whole gamut of human feeling, passion, and experience.  I also wished to satisfy you that
you have mind enough to become absorbed as soon as you begin to understand the significance
of the play. After you have once become an intelligent spectator of real life you can no more
go back to drawing-room chit-chat, gossip, and flirtation than you can lay down Shakespeare's
'Tempest' for a weak little parlor comedy. I am too shrewd a man, Marian, to try to disengage
you from the past by exhortations and homilies; and now that you have become my friend, I shall
be too sincere with you to disguise my purposes or methods. I propose to co-operate frankly
with you in your effort, for in this way I prove my faith in you and my respect for you. Soon
you will find yourself an actor in real life, as well as a spectator."

"I fear I have been one already,--a sorry one, too. It is possible to do mischief without being
very intelligent or deliberate. You are making my future, so far as you are concerned, clearer
than I imagined it could be. You do interest me deeply. In one evening you make it evident
how much I have lost in neglecting you--for I have neglected you, though not intentionally.
Hereafter I shall be only too proud if you will talk to me as you have done, giving me glimpses
of your thoughts, your work, and especially your dangers, where there are any. Never deceive
me in this respect, or leave me in ignorance. Whatever may be the weaknesses of my nature,
now that I have waked up, I am too proud a girl to receive all that I do from your hands and
then give almost my whole life and thought to others.  I shall be too delighted if you are
happier for my meddling and dropping down upon you. I'll keep your secrets too, you see;" and
she confirmed her words by an emphatic little nod. "You can talk to me about people, big and
little, with whom you have to do, just as serenely as if you were giving your confidence to
an oyster.

"But, papa, I am confronted by a question of real life, just as difficult for me as any that
can perplex you. I can't treat this question any more as I have done. I don't see my way at
all. Now I am going to be as direct and straightforward as a man, and not beat around the bush
with any womanish finesse. There is a gentleman in this city who, if he knew I was in town
to-night, would call, and I might not be able to prevent him from making a formal proposal.
He is a man whom I respect and like very much, and I fear I have been too encouraging,--not
intentionally and deliberately you know, but thoughtlessly. He was the cleverest and the most
entertaining of my friends, and always brought a breezy kind of excitement with him.  Don't
you see, papa? That is what I lived for, pleasure and excitement, and I don't believe that
anything can be so exciting to a girl as to see a man yielding to her fascinations, whatever
they may be. It gives one a delicious sense of power. I shall be frank, too. I must be, for
I want your advice. You men like power. History is full of the records of those who sold their
own souls for it, and walked through blood and crime to reach it. I think it is just as natural
for a woman to love power also, only now I see that it is a cruel and vile thing to get it
and use it merely for amusement. To me it was excitement. I don't like to think how it may
all end to a man like Fenton Lane, and I am so remorseful that I am half inclined to sacrifice
myself and make him as good a wife as I can."

"Do you love him?"

"No. I don't think I know what love is. When a mere girl I had a foolish little flame that
went out with the first breath of ridicule. Since that time I have enjoyed gentlemen's society
as naturally as any other girl of our set, perhaps more keenly. Their talk and ways are so
different from those of girls! Then my love of power came in, you see. The other girls were
always talking about their friends and followers, and it was my pride to surpass them all.
I liked one better than another, of course, but was always as ready for a new conquest as that
old fool, 'Alexander the Little,' who ran over the world and especially himself. What do you
think, papa? Shall I ever see one who will make all the others appear as nothing? Or, would
it be nobler to devote myself to a true, fine man, like Mr. Lane, no matter how I felt?"

"God forbid! You had better stay at your mother's side till you are as old and wrinkled as
Time himself."

"I am honestly glad to hear you say so. But what am I to do? Sooner or later I shall have to
refuse Mr. Lane, and others too."

"Refuse them, then. He would be less than a man who would ask a girl to sacrifice herself for
him. No, my dear, the most inalienable right of your womanhood is to love freely and give yourself
where you love. This right is one of the issues of this war,--that the poorest woman in this
land may choose her own mate. Slavery is the corner-stone of the Confederacy, wherein millions
of women can be given according to the will of masters. Should the South triumph, phases of
the Old-World despotism would creep in with certainly, and in the end we should have alliances,
not marriages, as is the case so generally abroad. [Footnote 176: Major Albrecht fought his guns
with great determination; his infantry escort, according to Boer accounts, retreated when they
saw the advance of the British, and his ammunition was almost exhausted,
but his gunners stood their ground.]

[Sidenote: Pole-Carew is obliged to fall back to Rosmead.]

[Sidenote: Nov. 28th/99.]

[Sidenote: Lord Methuen being wounded command devolves on Colvile.]

Captain
Forestier-Walker, who was now in action with the section of the 18th
battery near the farm which had been carried earlier in the day by
the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, vigorously shelled the trees
and brushwood in front of our men as they advanced, but his efforts
were much hampered by the fact that the undergrowth was so thick that
it was impossible to see exactly how far forward they were.

All attempts to establish communication
by signal, between the officer commanding the 9th brigade and the
troops on the south side of the river, failed.

The attack broke down from want of strength to drive it home, and
the baffled troops sullenly fell back to Rosmead.

They were so closely
pressed by the enemy's musketry that, in order to cover the retreat,
two officers, Major H. F. Coleridge, North Lancashire, and Captain
T. Irvine, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, each with ten or eleven
men of different battalions, threw themselves into farmhouses, which
they stubbornly defended until, many hours later, after their detachments
had suffered severe loss, they were ordered to evacuate their posts.

On his return to the village
Major-General Pole-Carew found that the British strength on the north
bank had been increased by the arrival of 300 officers and men of the Royal
engineers, and of part of a company of the 2nd battalion of the Coldstream
Guards. After writing to Lord Methuen to report his failure to force
his way up the right bank, and to ask for co-operation in the fresh
attempt for which he was then rallying his troops, Pole-Carew heard
a rumour that Lord Methuen had been wounded, and that Major-General
Colvile was now in command of the division.

The rumour was true. Lord Methuen had been wounded at about 4 p.m. near the centre of the line,
and one of his staff officers, Colonel H. P. Northcott, had previously fallen mortally wounded, while
conveying orders for the reinforcement of the troops on the north bank. Not long after this news came
in, the officer commanding the two guns of the 18th battery, still in action
near the farm to the south of Rosmead, reported that he heard through
the officer commanding the artillery that Major-General Colvile had
issued orders for a vigorous bombardment of the position by the artillery
till dusk, when the Guards were to attack the left of the Boer line with
the bayonet.

Pole-Carew then considered whether, in view of the projected movement of the Guards' brigade,
his local attack was still feasible. He decided that, owing to the configuration
of the ground over which both bodies of troops would have to move in
the darkness, the danger was so great lest his detachment should enfilade
the Guards as to prohibit an advance from Rosmead. All, therefore, that
could be done was to secure firmly that village.

[Sidenote: 62nd battery with four guns arrives after forced march.]

While the little column had been striving in vain to force its way up the
right bank of the river, the situation on the left bank had remained unchanged.
The infantry lay prone on the ground, engaged in a desultory fire-fight
with an unseen enemy, while the artillery continued to shell the
buildings and the river-banks near the railway bridge. During the course
of the afternoon Colonel Hall, commanding the artillery, had received
a welcome reinforcement of four guns of the 62nd battery, under Major
E. J. Granet.

The 62nd, which had been left to guard the Orange River bridge, received
orders late on the 26th to leave two guns at that camp, and proceed
with all speed to rejoin Lord Methuen's division. Owing to a deficiency
in rolling stock, no railway transport was available, and it became necessary
for the battery to march the whole way. Starting at 10 a.m. on the 27th,
Major Granet reached Belmont, thirty miles distant, at dusk.

He halted there till 6 a.m. on the 28th, when, escorted by twenty-five of the Royal Munster Fusiliers
mounted infantry, he marched to Honey Nest Kloof, where he decided to water and feed his horses.
He had but just halted, when a message reached him that there was fighting on the Riet river and that
guns and ammunition were urgently required there. He started immediately, and despite the heavy
ground over which he had to pass, reached the battlefield a little
after 2 p.m. In twenty-eight hours the 62nd battery had covered sixty-two
miles, at the expense of six horses which fell dead in the traces,
and of about forty more, which never recovered from the fatigue of
this forced march.

The battery was first sent to the left to support the advance up
the north bank of the river, but before it had opened fire, Colonel
Hall ordered Major Granet more to the eastward, as he was afraid that
the shells might fall among the detachment during its progress through
the trees and brushwood which concealed its movements.

At 2.45 p.m., the 62nd came into action 1,200 yards from the south bank, behind a swell in the ground
which covered the gunners from the waist downwards.

Its fire, aimed first at the north bank, was distributed laterally, and
then for depth, with good results, as the enemy's musketry slackened,
and numbers of men were seen stealing away.

About 5 p.m., to support the projected attack by the Guards, the
battery was moved close to a sandpit on the west of the railway, where
it was joined by the section of the 18th from the left of the line.

[Sidenote: Colvile breaks off the fight.]

After considerable delay, caused by the difficulty of sending messages across the shot-swept plain, Major-General
Colvile was informed that Lord Methuen had been wounded, and that
the command of the division had devolved upon him. He handed over the
Guards' brigade to Colonel Paget, Scots Guards, with orders to collect
his battalions for the attack upon the left of the Boer line, but
soon afterwards decided that it was too late to risk the passage of
the river at night with troops exhausted by hunger, thirst, and the
burning heat of an exceptionally hot day.

He therefore resolved to break off the fight till daybreak next morning, and directed Colonel Paget
to form up his brigade for the night at the southern reservoir.

[Sidenote: Pole-Carew holds Rosmead, and concentrates 9th brigade
on north bank.]

[Sidenote: Boers abandon position.

Night,
Nov. 28-29.]

As soon as Major-General Pole-Carew reluctantly abandoned the idea
of renewing his attack along the north bank of the Riet, he posted
his troops for the defence of Rosmead.

He realised the risks which he ran in holding so isolated a position throughout the night, but he and his
staff considered that the importance of maintaining the lodgment, which had been effected on
the enemy's side of the Riet, made it worth while to incur the danger. To the Royal engineers, under Major
G. F. Leverson, was allotted the western face of the village; the
Yorkshire Light Infantry held the north, and the Loyal North Lancashire
the north-east; the Argyll and Sutherland guarded the east.

The men lined the walls, banks, and houses at a yard and a half apart, in groups of six, of whom
five rested while one stood sentry. In the centre of the village was the reserve, two companies
of the Northumberland Fusiliers, and a company of the 2nd battalion
Coldstream Guards. The remainder of the 9th brigade was ordered to
cross the river.

To guide them, two fires were lit at the drift; and by daybreak the whole command was concentrated
on the north bank.

It was reinforced by the 1st Highland Light Infantry, who had arrived
during the night by rail from Orange River. In the grey of the morning, while
the Guards were preparing to support the 9th brigade, the guns[177]
re-opened fire upon Modder River village, but it was soon discovered
that during the night the enemy had abandoned his position, and had
disappeared with all his guns and pom-poms.

With horses utterly tired out, immediate pursuit was impossible,
though by midday patrols of mounted men had regained touch with such of
the Boers as had fallen back upon Magersfontein.

By the afternoon, the whole division had crossed the Riet, and was
concentrated on its northern bank.

[Footnote 177: On the 28th, the field batteries expended ammunition as follows:--

18th
1,029 rounds 62nd 247 " 75th 1,008 " The Naval guns 260 "]

[Sidenote: Casualties of Nov. 28th.]

The British casualties consisted of four officers killed (among whom was
Lieut.-Colonel H. R. Stopford, commanding the 2nd battalion Coldstream
Guards) and 19 wounded; among the other ranks 67 were killed, and 370
wounded.[178] The losses among the Boers are not accurately known,
but 23 burghers were found dead in Rosmead and buried near the village,
while 27 bodies were subsequently found in the river itself.

CHAPTER XVI.

THE RAID ON SOUTHERN NATAL.[179]

[Footnote 179: See map No. 4.]

[Sidenote: The relation of Ladysmith to the defence of Natal.]

Throughout the operations in Natal during the opening phase of the war,
Sir G. White had held that a mobile force, concentrated north of the
Tugela, afforded better protection to the central and southern portions
of the colony than any number of detachments stationed on the lines
of communication.

Face to face as he was with an enemy in superior strength, the retention
with his field force of every available unit was essential to the
British commander's plan of striking at his opponents whenever an
opportunity offered.

Sir W. Hely-Hutchinson, although anxious as to the security of Maritzburg
and Natal from Boer raids, accepted Sir George's decision, telegraphing
to the General on 26th October: "I shall do my best in consultation
with General Wolfe Murray.... I think we shall be able to deal with
any small raid, but a raid in force, especially if supported by guns,
will be a serious matter.

We must take
the risk, and hope for the best." On October 30th, the date of the battle of Lombards Kop,[180] the
only regular unit on the Natal line of communication was the 1st Border
regiment, which had arrived at Maritzburg that morning from East London.
Detachments of colonial troops held Colenso bridge and Estcourt.

To the eastward the Umvoti Rifles, a mounted corps rather more than one hundred strong, had been ordered
to fall back from Helpmakaar and watch the ferry, by which the Dundee-Greytown
road crosses the Tugela.

A battalion of mounted infantry was being raised at Maritzburg by Lieut.-Colonel Thorneycroft, Royal
Scots Fusiliers, and another at Durban by Lieut.-Colonel Bethune, 16th Lancers.

[Footnote 180: See Chapter X.]

[Sidenote: Threatened siege changes situation.]

The result of the battle of 30th October made it probable that the field
force at Ladysmith would be soon cut off from its communications. To
keep the road open to the south, Sir George White that evening reinforced
the garrison of Colenso by despatching thither by rail from Ladysmith
the 2nd Royal Dublin Fusiliers, a company of mounted infantry, and
the Natal Field battery, whose obsolete 7-pounder guns had been grievously
outranged at Elandslaagte.

On arrival at Colenso, the commanding officer of the Dublin, Colonel C. D. Cooper,
assumed command of that post, finding there one squadron of the Natal Carbineers,
one squadron Imperial Light Horse, a party of mounted Police, and the Durban
Light Infantry (about 380 strong), and a detachment (fifty strong) of
the Natal Naval Volunteers, with two 9-pounder guns. The total strength
of the command, including the reinforcements from Ladysmith, was approximately
1,200 men.

The
Natal Royal Rifles (150 strong) were encamped at Estcourt, twenty-five miles in rear.

[Sidenote: An anxious fortnight, Oct. 31st-Nov. 14th.]

On the following
day General White telegraphed to the Governor of the colony: "My intention
is to hold Ladysmith, make attacks on the enemy's position whenever
possible, and retain the greatest number of the enemy here."

Sir W. Hely-Hutchinson and the officer commanding the Natal line of communication, Brigadier-General
J. S. Wolfe Murray, were thus confronted with a difficult and anxious
situation.

It was obvious that, having regard to the numerical superiority and
greater mobility of the enemy, the British force at Ladysmith would,
in all probability, be unable to retain the whole of the Boer army.
A raid on southern Natal was therefore to be expected immediately,
and the strength of that raid might well be such as to overwhelm,
or, at any rate, to ignore, the weak garrisons which so imperfectly
covered Maritzburg and Durban.

Moreover, General Murray was aware that even if Sir R. Buller should
think fit to divert from Cape Colony any portion of the expeditionary
force now on the high seas, a fortnight must elapse before a single
man could be landed at Durban.

[Sidenote: Provisional steps in case of Boer raid.]

Maritzburg, from
its topographical environment, is even less adapted by nature for
defence than Ladysmith.

Lying in a deep depression surrounded by high hills, the positions
covering the capital of the colony are so extensive that a very large
force would be needed for their effective occupation.

Nevertheless, after consultation on the afternoon of 31st October with the Governor and the Prime
Minister of the colony (Colonel Hime), the Brigadier-General decided that, although it was impossible
to protect the town itself, it was advisable to prepare the cantonments, so-called "Fort Napier,"
for defence, and for that purpose to borrow Naval guns from the ships at Durban. As regards Durban,
a telegram was received from Sir Alfred Milner stating that arrangements
had been made by Sir Redvers Buller with the admiral for the immediate
despatch to that port of H.M.S. Terrible and Forte as a reinforcement to
the Tartar and Philomel, already in the harbour, and suggesting that
in the case of a complete disaster to Sir G. White's force it would
be wise to retire on the seaport and there make a stand.

[Sidenote: Changes of stations, Nov. 2nd and 3rd, in expectation of
raid.]

But the responsible military authorities were by no means inclined
to take a pessimistic view of the situation. The final instructions, dated
1st November, received from Sir G. White's Chief of the Staff, directed
General Murray "to remain and defend Maritzburg to the last," and on
the following day Sir R. Buller telegraphed from Capetown that a
division would be despatched as soon as possible to Natal, adding:
"Do all you can to hold on to Colenso till troops arrive."

Meanwhile, a warning had been received from the Intelligence staff
at Ladysmith, that a considerable body of Free Staters was moving
on Colenso, and Brigadier-General Murray, realising that the situation
of Colonel Cooper's force at the bridge, commanded by the heights
on the northern bank of the Tugela, was becoming precarious, directed
that officer to fall back on Estcourt, should he consider his position
no longer tenable.

On the afternoon of November 2nd, telegraphic communication between
Colenso and Ladysmith was cut off by the enemy, and a large Boer commando,
having occupied the high ground near Grobelaars Kloof (map No. 15),
opened fire on the two little works, Forts Wylie and Molyneux, which
had been constructed by the Natal Volunteers on the left bank of the
Tugela to cover the crossings of that river, and the approaches to
Langewacht Spruit.

The Natal Field battery and Natal Naval Volunteers' guns were again
seriously outranged by the Boer artillery, and Colonel Cooper decided
that, having regard to his instructions, he must fall back on Estcourt.

The withdrawal to that town was effected on the night of November 2nd-3rd
without molestation from the enemy, the infantry being conveyed in
special trains, the mounted troops and field artillery moving by road.
The 1st battalion Border regiment was simultaneously pushed forward
by rail from Maritzburg to Estcourt, and Brigadier-General Murray
proceeded, on 3rd November, to the latter station to take personal
command of the force there concentrated, which now amounted in all
to about 2,300 men.

With this force, weak though it was in guns and mounted troops, he intended
to dispute the Boer advance from the north, falling back, if necessary, on
the prepared position at Maritzburg. A telegram, dated 4th November,
conveyed General Buller's approval of these dispositions, but added:
"Do not risk losing Durban by over-prolonged defence of Maritzburg,
but hold the latter so long as you safely can.

I fear it will be at least ten days before I can send you substantial assistance."

[Sidenote: After much delay, on Nov. 13th/99, 4,200 Boers under Joubert
and Botha reach Colenso.]

Fortunately, until the last but one of these ten days, the enemy
held back on the north bank of the Tugela. A Krijgsraad, at which all
the Boer generals and commandants attended, had assembled in front of
Ladysmith on 1st November to decide whether the main effort of the
Boer army should be concentrated on the attack of that town, or whether,
leaving a detachment to hold Sir G. White's troops, they should at
once advance on Maritzburg and Durban.

Some of the younger leaders, including Louis Botha, as yet only plain
commandant, were in favour of the latter course. The majority of
the council decided that, so long as 12,000 effective British troops
remained at Ladysmith, the commandos were not numerous enough to
allow them to win the much-coveted prizes of the capital and seaport
of Natal.

It was believed that General White's troops would be unable to withstand an assault. On the
9th November, therefore, an abortive and ill-arranged attack was made. It sufficed to show that the Ladysmith
garrison was by no means disposed to yield, and that a formal and
perhaps prolonged investment would be needed to weaken its powers
of resistance.

To this task, therefore, the main body of the Boer commandos was assigned; but, as an erroneous
report had come in that 5,000 English troops had concentrated at
Frere, it was decided that a strong reconnaissance, under the personal
command of General Joubert, should cross the Tugela to ascertain the
disposition and strength of the British column.

On the evening, therefore, of the 13th November, a force about 4,200
strong was assembled at Colenso with orders to push to the south.

As agreed, Joubert, although Transvaal Commandant-General, went with
it.

Louis Botha, promoted to the rank of "Fighting General," was second
in command.

There is reason to believe that the presence of the senior General was due to a desire to restrain
the impetuosity of his subordinate.

[Sidenote: Defensive measures taken during the time of grace given by Boer delay.]

The fifteen days' breathing space which the authorities in southern Natal had thus been given, after receipt
of the disquieting intelligence of the battle of Lombards Kop, had been of great value. Captain
Percy Scott, H.M.S. Terrible, had reached Durban on November 6th, and was appointed commandant of that town.
A defence scheme was prepared and a battalion of "Imperial Light Infantry"
was raised to assist the Naval contingent,[181] and guns (including two
4.7-in. guns and sixteen 12-pr. 12-cwt.) were landed for its protection.

At Maritzburg
a position in the vicinity of Fort Napier had, under the supervision
of Col. C. C. Rawson, C.R.E., been prepared for defence, the work
being executed by a hastily improvised Pioneer Corps of artisans,
assisted by native labour.

In selecting this position and planning its defence, it was assumed that if
the force at Estcourt fell back on Maritzburg, 4,000 men in all would be available
for its occupation. Meanwhile, in addition to Thorneycroft's corps, the
recruiting and training of which were proceeding satisfactorily,
a provisional garrison was arranged for Maritzburg by the despatch
of two 12-pounders and a Naval detachment from the fleet at Durban,
by the withdrawal of the detachment of the Naval Volunteers from Estcourt,
and by the organisation into a Town Guard of all able-bodied citizens
willing to carry a rifle.

Moreover, some 150 loyal and zealous Natal colonists volunteered for scouting duties, and were formed
into a corps under the command of the Hon. T. K. Murray, C.M.G., finding their
own horses, saddlery, and rifles, and serving without pay.

This body of patriotic men did useful work to the north of Maritzburg,
in the neighbourhood of Mooi River, from the 4th to the 16th November,
when on the arrival of reinforcements from the Cape they were released
from further duty, and thanked in General Orders for their "excellent
service."

[Footnote 181: This contingent consisted of parties from the Terrible,
Forte, Thetis, Philomel and Tartar, of a total strength of 35 officers
and 423 men.

Commander Limpus, R.N., was placed in command of the guns (see p. 120).]

[Sidenote:
Nov. 11th/99. Reinforcements begin to disembark. Sir F. Clery takes command,

On 11th November General Murray, with the approval of Sir R. Buller,
handed over the command of the Estcourt garrison to Colonel Charles
Long, R.H.A., and returned to Maritzburg to direct personally the
heavy work falling on the line of communication staff in arranging
for the disembarkation and equipment of the reinforcements, whose
arrival at Durban was now hourly expected. You recognized just what you could be to him, and had the
skill--nature, rather, for all was unpremeditated--to obtain an influence by which you can
incite him to a better manhood and a greater success, perhaps, than if he were your accepted
lover.  Forgive this long preamble: I am thinking aloud and feeling my way, as it were. What
did you ask him to promise? Why, to make the most and best of himself. Why not let this sentence
suggest the social scheme of your life? Drop fellows who have neither brains nor heart,--no
good mettle in them,--and so far as you have influence strive to inspire the others to make
the most and best of themselves. You would not find the kitchen-maid a rival on this plan of
life; nor indeed, I regret to say, many of your natural associates. Outwardly your life will
appear much the same, but your motive will change everything, and flow through all your action
like a mountain spring, rendering it impossible for you to poison any life."

"O papa, the very possibility of what you suggest makes life appear beautiful. The idea of
a convent!"

"Convents are the final triumph of idiocy. If bad women could be shut up and made to say prayers
most of the time, no harm at least would be done,--the good, problematical; but to immure a
woman of sweet, natural, God-bestowed impulses is the devil's worst practical joke in this
world. Come, little girl, it's late. Think over the scheme; try it as you have a chance; use
your power to incite men to make the most and best of themselves. This is better than levying
your little tribute of flattery and attention, like other belles,--a phase of life as common
as cobble-stones and as old as vanity. For instance, you have an artist among your friends.
Possibly you can make him a better artist and a better fellow in every way. Drop all muffs
and sticks; don't waste yourself on them. Have considerable charity for some of the wild fellows,
none for their folly, and from the start tolerate no tendencies toward sentimentality. You
will find that the men who admire girls bent on making eyes rather than making men will soon
disappear. Sensible fellows won't misunderstand you, even though prompted to more than friendship;
and you will have a circle of friends of which any woman might be proud. Of course you will
find at times that unspoken negatives will not satisfy; but if a woman has tact, good sense,
and sincerity, her position is impregnable. As long as she is not inclined to love a man herself,
she can, by a mere glance, not only define her position, but defend it. By simple dignity and
reserve she can say to all, 'Thus far and no farther.' If, without encouragement, any one seeks
to break through this barrier he meets a quiet negative which he must respect, and in his heart
does respect. Now, little girl, to sum up your visit, with its long talks and their dramatic
and unexpected illustration, I see nothing to prevent you from going forward and making the
best and most of your life according to nature and truth. You have a good start, and a rather
better chance than falls to the lot of the majority."

"Truly," said Marian, thoughtfully, "we don't appear to grow old and change by time so much
as by what happens,--by what we think and feel. Everything appears changed, including you and
myself."

"It's more in appearance than in reality. You will find the impetus of your old life so strong
that it will be hard even to change the direction of the current. You will be much the same
outwardly, as I said before. The stream will flow through the same channel of characteristic
traits and habits. The vital change must be in the stream itself,--the motive from which life
springs."

How true her father's words seemed on the following evening after her return! Her mother, as
she sat down, to their dainty little dinner, looked as if her serenity had been undisturbed
by a single perplexing thought during the past few days. There was the same elegant, yet rather
youthful costume for a lady of her years; the same smiling face, not yet so full in its outline
as to have lost all its girlish beauty. It was marred by few evidences of care and trouble,
nor was it spiritualized by thought or deep experience.

Marian observed her closely, not with any disposition towards cold or conscious criticism,
but in order that she might better understand the conditions of her own life. She also had
a wakening curiosity to know just what her mother was to her father and he to her. The hope
was forming that she could make them more to each other. She had too much tact to believe that
this could be done by general exhortations. If anything was to be accomplished it must be by
methods so fine and unobtrusive as to be scarcely recognized.

Her father's inner life had been a revelation to her, and she was led to query: "Why does not
mamma understand it? CAN she understand it?" Therefore she listened attentively to the details
of what had happened in her absence. She waited in vain for any searching and intelligent questions
concerning the absent husband. Beyond that he was well, and that everything about the house
was just as she had left it, Mrs. Vosburgh appeared to have no interest. She was voluble over
little household affairs, the novel that just then absorbed her, and especially the callers
and their chagrin at finding the young girl absent.

"Only the millionnaire widower remained any length of time when learning that you were away,"
said the lady, "and he spent most of the evening with me. I assure you he is a very nice, entertaining
old fellow."

"How did he entertain you? What did he talk about?"

"Let me remember. Now I think of it, what didn't he talk about? He is one of the most agreeable
gossips I ever met,--knows everybody and everything. He has at his finger-ends the history
of all who were belles in my time, and" (complacently) "I find that few have done better than
I, while some, with all their opportunities, chose very crooked sticks."

"You are right, mamma. It seems to me that neither of us half appreciates papa. He works right
on so quietly and steadily, and yet he is not a machine, but a man."

"Oh, I appreciate him. Nine out of ten that he might have married would have made him no end
of trouble. I don't make him any. Well, after talking about the people we used to know, Mr.
Lanniere began a tirade against the times and the war, which he says have cost him a hundred
thousand dollars; but he took care in a quiet way to let me know that he has a good many hundred
thousands left. I declare, Marian, you might do a great deal worse."

"Do you not think I might do a great deal better?" the young girl asked, with a frown.

"I have no doubt you think so. Girls will be romantic. I was, myself; but as one goes on in
life one finds that a million, more or less, is a very comfortable fact. Mr. Lanniere has a
fine house in town, but he's a great traveller, and an habitue of the best hotels of this country
and Europe. You could see the world with him on its golden side."

"Well, mamma, I want a man,--not an habitue. What's more, I must be in love with the man, or
he won't stand the ghost of a chance. So you see the prospects are that you will have me on
your hands indefinitely. Mr. Lanniere, indeed! What should I be but a part of his possessions,--another
expensive luxury in his luxurious life? I want a man like papa,--earnest, large-brained, and
large-hearted,--who, instead of inveighing against the times, is absorbed in the vital questions
of the day, and is doing his part to solve them rightly. I would like to take Mr. Lanniere
into a military hospital or cemetery, and show him what the war has cost other men."

"Why, Marian, how you talk!"

"I wish I could make you know how I feel. It seems to me that one has only to think a little
and look around in order to feel deeply. I read of an awful battle while coming up in the cars.
We have been promised, all the spring, that Richmond would be taken, the war ended, and all
go on serenely again; but it doesn't look like it."

"What's the use of women distressing themselves with such things?" said Mrs. Vosburgh, irritably.
"I can't bear to think of war and its horrors, except as they give spice to a story. Our whole
trouble is a big political squabble, and you know I detest politics. It is just as Mr. Lanniere
says,--if our people had only let slavery alone all would have gone on veil. The leaders on
both sides will find out before the summer is over that they have gone too far and fast, and
they had better settle their differences with words rather than blows. We shall all be shaking
hands ana making up before Christmas."

"Papa doesn't think so."

"Your father is a German at heart. He has the sense to be practical about every-day affairs
and enjoy a good dinner, but he amuses himself with cloudy speculations and ideals and vast
questions about the welfare of the world, or the 'trend of the centuries,' as he said one day
to me. I always try to laugh him out of such vague nonsense. Has he been talking to you about
the 'trend of the centuries'?"

"No, mamma, he has not," replied Marian, gravely; "but if he does I shall try to understand
what he means and be interested. I know that papa feels deeply about the war, and means to
take the most effective part in it that he can, and that he does not think it will end so easily
as you believe. These facts make me feel anxious, for I know how resolute papa is."

"He has no right to take any risks," said the lady, emphatically.

"He surely has the same right that other men have."

"Oh, well," concluded Mrs. Vosburgh, with a shrug, "there is no use in borrowing trouble. When
it comes to acting, instead of dreaming and speculating on vast, misty questions, I can always
talk your father into good sense. That is the best thing about him,--he is well-balanced, in
spite of his tendency to theories. When I show him that a thing is quixotic he laughs, shrugs
his shoulders, and good-naturedly goes on in the even tenor of his way. It was the luckiest
thing in the world for him when he married me, for I soon learned his weak points, and have
ever guarded him against them. As a result he has had a quiet, prosperous career. If he wishes
to serve the government in some civilian capacity, and is well paid for it, why shouldn't he?
But I would never hear of his going to the front, fighting, and marching in Virginia mud and
swamps. If he ever breathes such a thought to you, I hope you will aid me in showing him how
cruel and preposterous it is."

Marian sighed, as she thought: "I now begin to see how well papa understands mamma, but has
she any gauge by which to measure him? I fear he has found his home lonely, in spite of good
dinners."

"Come, my dear," resumed Mrs. Vosburgh, "we are lingering too long. Some of your friends may
be calling soon, although I said I did not know whether you would be at home to-night or not.
Mr. Lanniere will be very likely to come, for I am satisfied that he has serious intentions.
What's more, you might do worse,--a great deal worse."

"Three times you have said that, mamma, and I don't like it," said Marian, a little indignantly.
"Of course I might do worse; I might kill him, and I should be tempted to if I married him.
You know that I do not care for him, and he knows it, too. Indeed, I scarcely respect him.
You don't realize what you are saying, for you would not have me act from purely mercenary
motives?"

"Oh, certainly not; but Mr. Lanniere is not a monster or a decrepit centenarian. He is still
in his prime, and is a very agreeable and accomplished man of the world. He is well-connected,
moves in the best society, and could give his wife everything."

"He couldn't give me happiness, and he would spoil my life."

"Oh well, if you feel so, there is nothing more to be said. I can tell you, though, that multitudes
of girls would be glad of your chance; but, like so many young people, you have romantic ideas,
and do not appreciate the fact that happiness results chiefly from the conditions of our lot,
and that we soon learn to have plenty of affection for those who make them all we could desire;"
and she touched a bell for the waitress, who had been temporarily dismissed.

The girl came in with a faint smile on her face. "Has she been listening?" thought Marian.
"That creature, then, with her vain, pretty, yet vulgar face, is the type of what I was. She
has been lighting the drawing-room for me to do what she proposes to do later in the evening.
She looks just the same. Mamma is just the same.  Callers will come just the same. How unchanged
all is, as papa said it would be! I fear much may be unchangeable."

She soon left the dining-room for the parlor, her dainty, merry little campaigning-ground.
What should be its future record? Could she carry out the scheme of life which her father had
suggested? "Well," she concluded, with an ominous flash in her eyes at her fair reflection
in the mirror, "whether I can incite any one to better things or not, I can at least do some
freezing out. That gossipy, selfish old Mr. Lanniere must take his million to some other market.
I have no room in my life for him. Neither do I dote on the future acquaintance of Mr. Strahan.
I shall put him on probation. If men don't want my society and regard on the new conditions,
they can stay away; if they persist in coming, they must do something finer and be something
finer than in the past. The friendship of one man like Fenton Lane is worth more than the attention
of a wilderness of muffs and sticks, as papa calls them. What I fear is that I shall appear
goody-goody, and that would disgust every one, including myself."

CHAPTER VII.

SURPRISES.

MR. Lanniere evidently had serious intentions, for he came unfashionably early. He fairly beamed
on the young girl when he found her at home. Indeed, as she stood before him in her radiant
youth, which her evening costume enhanced with a fine taste quickly recognized by his practised
eyes, he very justly regarded her as better than anything which his million had purchased hitherto.
It might easily be imagined that he had added a little to the couleur de rose of the future
by an extra glass of Burgundy, for he positively appeared to exude an atmosphere of affluence,
complacency, and gracious intention. The quick-witted girl detected at once his King-Cophetua
air, and she was more amused than embarrassed. Then the eager face of Fenton Lane arose in
her fancy, and she heard his words, "I would shoulder a musket and march away to-morrow if
you bade me!" How insignificant was all that this man could offer, as compared with the boundless,
self-sacrificing love of the other, before whom her heart bowed in sincere homage if nothing
more! What was this man's offer but an expression of selfishness? And what could she ever be
but an accessory of his Burgundy? Indeed, as his eyes, humid from wine, gloated upon her, and
he was phrasing his well-bred social platitudes and compliments, quite oblivious of the fact
that HER eyes were taking on the blue of a winter sky, her cheeks began to grow a little hot
with indignation and shame. He knew that she did not love him, that naturally she could not,
and that there had been nothing in their past relations to inspire even gratitude and respect
towards him. In truth, his only effort had been to show his preference and to indicate his
wishes. What then could his offer mean but the expectation that she would take him as a good
bargain, and, like any well-bred woman of the world, comply with all its conditions? Had she
given him the impression that she could do this? While the possibility made her self-reproachful,
she was conscious of rising resentment towards him who was so complacently assuming that she
was for sale.

"Indeed, Miss Vosburgh," was the conclusion of his rather long preliminaries, "you must not
run away soon again. June days may be charming under any circumstances, but your absence certainly
insures dull June evenings."

"You are burdening your conscience without deceiving me," the young girl replied, demurely,
"and should not so wrong yourself. Mamma said that you were very entertaining, and that last
evening was a delightful one. It could scarcely be otherwise. It is natural that people of
the same age should be congenial. I will call mamma at once."

"I beg you will not,--at least not just yet. I have something to say to which I trust you will
listen kindly and favorably. Do you think me so very old?"

"No older than you have a perfect right to be, Mr. Lanniere," said the girl, laughing. "I can
think of no reason for your reproachful tone."

"Let me give you one then. Your opinions are of immense importance to me."

"Truly, Mr. Lanniere, this is strange beyond measure, especially as I am too young to have
formed many opinions."

"That fact only increases my admiration and regard One must reach my years in order to appreciate
truly the dewy freshness of youth. The world is a terra incognita to you yet, and your opinions
of life are still to be formed. Let me give you a chance to see the world from lofty, sunny
elevations."

"I am too recently from my geography not to remember that while elevations may be sunny they
are very cold," was the reply, with a charming little shiver. "Mont Blanc has too much perspective."

"Do not jest with me or misunderstand me, Miss Vosburgh," he said, impressively. "There is
a happy mean in all things."

"Yes, Mr. Lanniere, and the girl who means to be happy should take care to discover it."

"May it not be discovered for her by one who is better acquainted with life? In woman's experience
is not happiness more often thrust upon her than achieved? I, who know the world and the rich
pleasures and triumphs it affords to one who, in the military phrase of the day, is well supported,
can offer you a great deal,--more than most men, I assure you."

"Why, Mr. Lanniere," said the young girl, looking at him with demure surprise, "I am perfectly
contented and happy. No ambition for triumphs is consuming me. What triumphs? As for pleasure,
each day brings all and more than I deserve. Young as one may be, one can scarcely act without
a motive."

"Then I am personally nothing to you?" he said stiffly, and rising.

"Pardon me, Mr. Lanniere. I hope my simple directness may not appear childish, but it seems
to me that I have met your suggestions with natural answers; What should you be to me but an
agreeable friend of mamma's?"

He understood her fence perfectly, and was aware that the absence of a mercenary spirit on
her part made his suit appear almost ridiculous. If her clear young eyes would not see him
through a golden halo, but only as a man and a possible mate, what could he be to her? Even
gold-fed egotism could not blind him to the truth that she was looking at HIM, and that the
thought of bartering herself for a little more of what she had to her heart's content already
was not even considered. There was distressing keenness in the suggestion that, not wanting
the extraneous things he offered, no motive was left. He was scarcely capable of suspecting
her indignation that he should deem her capable of sacrificing her fair young girlhood for
greater wealth and luxury, even had she coveted them,--an indignation enhanced by her new impulses.
The triumphs, happiness, and power which she now was bent on achieving could never be won under
the dense shade of his opulent selfishness. He embodied all that was inimical to her hopes
and plans, all that was opposed to the motives and inspiration received from her father, and
she looked at him with unamiable eyes.

While he saw this to some extent, he was unaccustomed to denial by others or by himself. She
was alluringly beautiful, as she stood before him,--all the more valued because she valued
herself so highly, all the more coveted because superior to the sordid motives upon which even
he had counted as the chief allies in his suit. In the intense longing of a self-indulgent
nature he broke out, seizing her hand as he spoke: "O Miss Marian, do not deny me. I know I
could make you happy. I would give you everything. Your slightest wish should be law. I would
be your slave."

"I do not wish a slave," she replied, freezingly, withdrawing her hand. "I am content, as I
told you; but were I compelled to make a choice it should be in favor of a man to whom I could
look up, and whom I could aid in manly work. I shall not make a choice until compelled to by
my heart."

"If your heart is still your own, give me a chance to win it," resumed the suitor, seeking
vainly to take her hand again. "I am in my prime, and can do more than most men. I will put
my wealth at your disposal, engage in noble charities, patriotic--"

This interview had been so absorbing as to make them oblivious of the fact that another visitor
had been admitted to the hall. Hearing voices in the drawing-room, Mr. Strahan entered, and
now stood just behind Mr. Lanniere, with an expression in which dismay, amusement, and embarrassment
were so comically blended that Marian, who first saw him, had to cover her face with her handkerchief
to hide her sense of the ludicrous.

"Pardon me," said the inopportune new-comer, "I--I--"

"Maledictions on you!" exclaimed the goaded millionnaire, now enraged beyond self-control,
and confronting the young fellow with glaring, bloodshot eyes.

This greeting put Strahan entirely at his ease, and a glimpse of Marian's mirth had its influence
also. She had turned instantly away, and gone to the farther side of the apartment.

"Come now, Mr. Lanniere," he said, with an assumption of much dignity; "there is scant courtesy
in your greeting, and without reason. I have the honor of Miss Vosburgh's acquaintance as truly
as yourself. This is her parlor, and she alone has the right to indicate that I am unwelcome.
I shall demand no apologies here and now, but I shall demand them. I may appear very young--"

"Yes, you do; very young. I should think that ears like yours might have--" And then the older
man paused, conscious that the violence of his anger was carrying him too far.

Strahan struck a nonchalant attitude, as he coolly remarked: "My venerable friend, your passion
is unbecoming to your years. Miss Vosburgh, I humbly ask your pardon that my ears were not
long enough to catch the purport of this interview. I am not in the habit of listening at a
lady's door before I enter. My arrival at a moment so awkward for me was my misfortune. I discovered
nothing to your discredit, Mr. Lanniere. Indeed, your appreciation of Miss Vosburgh is the
most creditable thing I know about you,--far more so than your insults because I merely entered
the door to which I was shown by the maid who admitted me. Miss Vosburgh, with your permission
I will now depart, in the hope that you will forgive the annoyance--"

"I cannot give you my permission under the circumstances, Mr. Strahan. You have committed no
offence against me, or Mr. Lanniere, either, as he will admit after a little thought. Let us
regard the whole matter as one of those awkward little affairs over which good breeding can
speedily triumph. Sit down, and I will call mamma."

"Pardon me, Miss Vosburgh," said Mr. Lanniere, in a choking voice, for he could not fail to
note the merriment which the mercurial Strahan strove in vain to suppress; "I will leave you
to more congenial society. I have paid you the highest compliment in my power, and have been
ill-requited."

As if stung, the young girl took a step towards him, and said, indignantly: "What was the nature
of your compliment? What have you asked but that I should sell myself for money? I may have
appeared to you a mere society girl, but I was never capable of that. Good-evening, sir."

Mr. Lanniere departed with tingling ears, and a dawning consciousness that he had over-rated
his million, and that he had made a fool of himself generally.

All trace of mirth passed from Strahan's expression, as he looked at the young girl's stern,
flushed face and the angry sheen of her eyes.

"By Jove!" he exclaimed, "that's magnificent. I've seen a girl now to whom I can take off my
hat, not as a mere form. Half the girls in our set would have given their eyes for the chance
of capturing such a man. Think what a vista of new bonnets he suggests!"

"You are probably mistaken. One girl has proved how she regarded the vista, and I don't believe
you had any better opinion of me than of the others. Come now, own up. Be honest. Didn't you
regard me as one of the girls 'in our set' as you phrase it, that would jump at the chance?"

"Oh, nonsense, Miss Marian. The idea--"

She checked him by a gesture. "I wish downright sincerity, and I shall detect the least false
note in your words."

Strahan looked into her resolute, earnest eyes a moment, and then revealed a new trait. He
discarded the slight affectation that characterized his manner, stood erect, and returned her
gaze steadily. "You ask for downright sincerity?" he said.

"Yes; I will take nothing less."

"You have no right to ask it unless you will be equally sincere with me."

"Oh, indeed; you are in a mood for bargains, as well as Mr. Lanniere."

"Not at all. You have stepped out of the role of the mere society girl. In that guise I shall
be all deference and compliments. On the basis of downright sincerity I have my rights, and
you have no right to compel me to give an honest opinion so personal in its nature without
giving one in return."

"I agree," she said, after a moment's thought.

"Well, then, while I was by no means sure, I thought it was possible, even probable, that you
would accept a man like Lanniere.  I have known society girls to do such things, haven't you?"

"And I tell you, Mr. Strahan, that you misjudge a great many society girls."

"Oh, you must tell me a great deal more than that. Have I not just discovered that I misjudged
one? Now pitch into Arthur Strahan."

"I am inclined to think that I have misjudged you, also; but I will keep my compact, and give
you the impression you made, and you won't like it."

"I don't expect to; but I shall expect downright sincerity."

"Very well. I'll test you. You are not simple and manly, even in your dress and manner; you
are an anomaly in the country; you are inclined to gossip; and it's my belief that a young
man should do more in life than amuse himself."

Strahan flushed, but burst out laughing as he exclaimed, "My photograph, by Jupiter!"

"Photographs give mere surface. Come, what's beneath it?"

"In one respect, at least, I think I am on a par with yourself. I have enough honest good-nature
to listen to the truth with thanks."

"Is that all?"

"Come, Miss Marian, what is the use of words when I have had such an example of deeds? I have
caught you, red-handed, in the act of giving a millionnaire his conge. In the face of this
stern fact do you suppose I am going to try to fish up some germs of manhood for your inspection?
As you have suggested, I must do something, or I'm out of the race with you. I honestly believe,
though, I am not such a fool as I have seemed. I shall always be something of a rattle-brain,
I suppose, and if I were dying I could not help seeing the comical side of things." He hesitated
a moment, and then asked, abruptly, "Miss Marian, have you read to-day's paper?"

"Yes, I have," with a tinge of sadness in her tone.

"Well, so have I. Think of thousands of fine young fellows lying stiff and stark in those accursed
swamps!"

"Yes," she cried, with a rush of tears, "I WILL think of them. I will try to see them, horrible
as the sight is, even in fancy. When they died so heroically, shame on me if I turn away in
weak, dainty disgust! Oh, the burning shame that Northern girls don't think more of such men
and their self-sacrifice!"

"You're a trump, Miss Marian; that's evident. Well, one little bit of gossip about myself,
and then I must go. I have another engagement this evening. Old Lanniere was right. I'm young,
and I've been very young. Of late I've made deliberate effort to remain a fool; but a man has
got to be a fool or a coward down to the very hard-pan of his soul if the logic of recent events
has no effect on him. I don't think I am exactly a coward, but the restraint of army-life,
and especially roughing it, is very distasteful. I kept thinking it would all soon be over,
that more men were in now than were needed, and that it was a confounded disagreeable business,
and all that. But my mind wasn't at rest; I wasn't satisfied with the ambitions of my callow
youth; and, as usual when one is in trouble and in doubt about a step, I exaggerated my old
folly to disguise my feelings. But this Richmond campaign, and the way Stonewall Jackson has
been whacking our fellows in the Shenandoah, made me feel that I was standing back too long,
and the battle described in to-day's paper brought me to a decision. I'm in for it, Miss Marian.
You may think I'm not worth the powder required to blow me up, but I'm going to Virginia as
soon as I can learn enough not to be more dangerous to those around me than to the enemy."

She darted to his side, and took his hand, exclaiming, "Mr. Strahan! forgive me; I've done
you a hundred-fold more injustice than you have me!"

He was visibly embarrassed, a thing unusual with him, and he said, brusquely: "Oh, come now,
don't let us have any pro patria exaltation. I don't resemble a hero any more than I do a doctor
of divinity. I'm just like lots of other young fellows who have gone, only I have been slower
in going, and my ardor won't set the river on fire. But the times are waking up all who have
any wake-up in them, and the exhibition of the latest English cut in coats and trousers is
taking on a rather inglorious aspect. How ridiculous it all seems in the light of the last
battle! Jove! but I HAVE been young!"

He did look young indeed, with his blond mustache and flushed face, that was almost as fair
as a girl's. She regarded him wonderingly, thinking how strangely events were applying the
touchstone to one and another. But the purpose of this boyish-appearing exquisite was the most
unexpected thing in the era of change that had begun. She could scarcely believe it, and exclaimed,
"You face a cannon?"

"I don't look like it, do I? I fancy I would. I should be too big a coward to run away, for
then I should have to come back to face you, which would be worse, you know. I'm not going
to do any bragging, however. Deeds, deeds. Not till I have laid out a Johnny, or he has laid
me out, can I take rank with you after your rout of the man of millions. I don't ask you to
believe in me yet."

"Well, I do believe in you. You are making an odd yet vivid impression on me. I believe you
will face danger just as you did Mr.  Lanniere, in a half-nonchalant and a half-satirical mood,
while all the time there will be an undercurrent of downright earnestness and heroism in you,
which you will hide as if you were ashamed of it."

He flushed with pleasure, but only laughed, "We'll see." Then after a moment he added, "Since
we are down to the bed-rock in our talk I'll say out the rest of my say, then follow Lanniere,
and give him something more to digest before he sleeps."

"Halt, sir--military jargon already--how can you continue your quarrel with Mr. Lanniere without
involving my name?"

Strahan looked blank for a second, then exclaimed: "Another evidence, of extreme youth! Lanniere
may go to thunder before I risk annoying you."

"Yes, thank you; please let him go to thunder. He won't talk of the affair, and so can do you
no harm."

"Supposing he could, that would be no excuse for annoying you."

"I think you punished him sufficiently before he went, and without ceasing to be a gentleman,
too. If you carry out your brave purpose you need not fear for your reputation."

"Well, Miss Marian, I shall carry it out. Society girl as I believed you to be, I like you
better than the others. Don't imagine I'm going to be sentimental. I should stand as good a
chance of winning a major-general's stars as you. I've seen better fellows raising the siege
and disappearing, you know. Well, the story I thought would be short is becoming long. I wanted
to tell you first what I proposed; for, hang it all! I've read it in your eyes that you thought
I was little better than a popinjay, and I wished to prove to you that I could be a man after
my fashion."

"I like your fashion, and am grateful for your confidence. What's more, you won't be able to
deceive me a bit hereafter. I shall persist in admiring you as a brave man, and shall stand
up for you through thick and thin."

"You always had a kind of loyalty to us fellows that we recognized and appreciated."

"I feel now as if I had not been very loyal to any one, not even myself. As with you, however,
I must let the future tell a different story."

"If I make good my words, will you be my friend?"

"Yes, yes indeed, and a proud one. But oh!"--she clasped her hand over her eyes,--"what is
all this tending to? When I think of the danger and suffering to which you may--"

"Oh, come now," he interrupted, laughing, but with a little suspicious moisture in eyes as
blue as her own; "it will be harder for you to stay and think of absent friends than for them
to go. I foresee how it will turn out. You will be imagining high tragedy on stormy nights
when we shall be having a jolly game of poker. Good-night. I shall be absent for a time,--going
to West Point to be coached a little by my friend Captain Varrum."

He drew himself up, saluted her a la militaire, right-about-faced with the stiffness of a ramrod,
and was departing, when a light hand touched his arm, and Marian said, with a look so kind
and sympathetic that his eyes fell before it: "Report to me occasionally, Captain Strahan.
There are my colors;" and she gave him a white rose from her belt.

His mouth quivered slightly, but with a rather faltering laugh he replied, as he put the rose
to his lips, "Never let the color suggest that I will show the white feather;" and then he
began his military career with a precipitate retreat.

CHAPTER VIII.

CHARMED BY A CRITIC.

"WHAT next?" was Marian's wondering query after Mr. Strahan's departure. The change of motive
which already had had no slight influence on her own action and feeling had apparently ushered
in a new era in her experience; but the sense of novelty in personal affairs was quite lost
as she contemplated the transformation in the mercurial Strahan, who had apparently been an
irredeemable fop. That the fastidious exquisite should tramp through Virginia mud, and face
a battery of hostile cannon, appeared to her the most marvellous of human paradoxes. An hour
before she would have declared the idea preposterous. Now she was certain he would do all that
he had said, and would do it in the manner satirical and deprecatory towards himself which
she had suggested.

Radical as the change seemed, she saw that it was a natural one as he had explained it. If
there was any manhood in him the times would evoke it. After all, his chief faults had been
youth and a nature keenly sensitive to certain social influences. Belonging to a wealthy and
fashionable clique in the city, he had early been impressed by the estimated importance of
dress and gossip. To excel in these, therefore, was to become pre-eminent. As time passed,
however, the truth, never learned by some, that his clique was not the world, began to dawn
on him. He was foolish, but not a fool; and when he saw young fellows no older than himself
going to the front, when he read of their achievements and sufferings, he drew comparisons.
The result was that he became more and more dissatisfied. He felt that he was anomalous, in
respect not only to the rural scenery of his summer home, but to the times, and the conviction
was growing that the only way to right himself was to follow the host of American youth who
had gone southward. It was a conviction to which he could not readily yield, and which he sought
to disguise by exaggerating his well-known characteristics. People of his temperament often
shrink from revealing their deeper feelings, believing that these would seem to others so incongruous
as to call forth incredulous smiles. Strahan was not a coward, except in the presence of ridicule.
This had more terrors for him than all the guns of the Confederacy; and he knew that every
one, from his own family down, would laugh at the thought of his going to the war. In a way
that puzzled him a little he felt that he would not care so much if Marian Vosburgh did not
laugh. The battle of which he had read to-day had at last decided him; he must go; but if Marian
would give him credit for a brave, manly impulse, and not think of him as a ludicrous spectacle
when he donned the uniform, he would march away with a light heart. He did not analyze her
influence over him, but only knew that she had a peculiar fascination which it was not in his
impressionable nature to resist.

Thus it may be seen that he only gave an example of the truth that great apparent changes are
the result of causes that have long been secretly active.

Marian, like many others, did not sufficiently take this fact into account, and was on the
qui vive for other remarkable manifestations. They did not occur. As her father had predicted,
life, in its outward conditions, resumed its normal aspects. Her mother laughed a little, sighed
a little, when she heard the story of Mr. Lanniere's final exit; the coquettish kitchen-maid
continued her career with undisturbed complacency; and Marian to her own surprise found that,
after the first days of her enthusiasm had passed, it required the exertion of no little will-power
to refrain from her old motives and tactics. But she was loyal to herself and to her implied
promise to her father. She knew that he was watching her,--that he had set his heart on the
development, in a natural way, of her best traits. She also knew that if she faltered she must
face his disappointment and her own contempt.

She had a horror, however, of putting on what she called "goody-goody airs," and under the
influence of this feeling acted much like her old self. Not one of her callers could have charged
her with manifesting a certain kind of misleading favor, but her little salon appeared as free
from restraint as ever, and her manner as genial and lively. It began to be observed by some,
however, that while she participated unhesitatingly in the light talk of others, she herself
would occasionally broach topics of more weight, especially such as related to the progress
of the war; and more than once she gave such direction to her conversation with the artist
as made his eyes kindle.

Her father was satisfied. He usually came home late on Saturday, and some of her gentleman
friends who were in the habit of dropping in of a Sunday evening, were soon taught that these
hours were engaged.

"You need not excuse yourself on my account," her father had said to her.

"But I shall," was her prompt response. "After all you have done and are doing for me, it's
a pity if I can't give you one evening in the week. You are looking after other people in New
York; I'm going to look after you; and you shall find that I am a sharp inquisitor. You must
reveal enough of the secrets of that mysterious office of yours to satisfy me that you are
not in danger."

He soon began to look forward with glad anticipation to his ramble by her side in the summer
twilight. He saw that what he had done and what he had thought during the week interested her
deeply, and to a girl of her intelligence he had plenty to tell that was far from commonplace.
She saw the great drama of her country's history unfolding, and not only witnessed the events
that were presented to the world, but was taken behind the scenes and shown many of the strange
and secret causes that were producing them. Moreover expectation of something larger and greater
was constantly raised. After their walk they would return to the house, and she would sing
or read to him until she saw his eyes heavy with the sleep that steals gradually and refreshingly
into a weary man's brain.

Mrs. Vosburgh observed this new companionship with but little surprise and no jealousy. "It
was time," she said, "that Marian should begin to do something for her father, and not leave
everything to me."

One thing puzzled Marian: weeks were passing and she neither saw nor heard anything of Lane
or Strahan. This fact, in view of what had been said at parting, troubled her. She was not
on calling terms with the latter's family, and therefore was unable to learn anything from
them. Even his male friends in the neighborhood did not know where he was or what he was doing.
Her father had taken the pains to inform himself that Lane was apparently at work in his law-office
as usual. These two incipient subjects of the power she hoped to wield seemed to have dropped
her utterly, and she was discouraged.

On the last day of June she was taking a ramble in a somewhat wild and secluded place not far
from her home, and thinking rather disconsolately that her father had overrated her influence,--that
after all she was but a pretty and ordinary girl, like millions of others,--a fact that Lane
and Strahan had at last discovered. Suddenly she came upon the artist, sketching at a short
distance from her. As she turned to retreat a twig snapped under her foot, revealing her presence.
He immediately arose and exclaimed, "Miss Vosburgh, is it I that you fear, or a glimpse of
my picture?"

"Neither, of course. I feared I might dispel an inspired mood. Why should I intrude, when you
have nature before you and the muse looking over your shoulder?"

"Over my left shoulder, then, with a mocking smile. You are mistaken if you fancy you can harm
any of my moods. Won't you stay and criticise my picture for me?"

"Why, Mr. Blauvelt, I'm not an art critic."

"Yes, you are,--one of the class I paint for. Our best critics are our patrons, cultivated people."

"I should never think of patronizing you."

"Perhaps you might entertain the thought of encouraging me a little, if you felt that I was
worth it."

"Now, Mr. Blauvelt, notwithstanding the rural surroundings, you must remember that I was bred
in the city. I know the sovereign contempt that you artists have for the opinions of the people.
When it comes to art, I'm only people."

"No such generalization will answer in your case. You have as distinct an individuality as
any flower blooming on this hillside."

"There are flowers and flowers. Some are quite common."

"None are commonplace to me, for there is a genuine bit of nature in every one. Still you are
right: I was conscious of the fragrance from this eglantine-bush here, until you came."

"Oh, then let me go at once."

"I beg that you will not. You are the eglantine in human form, and often quite as briery."

"Then you should prefer the bush there, which gives you its beauty and fragrance without a
scratch. But truly your comparison is too far-fetched, even for an artist or a poet, for I
suppose they are near of kin. To sensible, matter-of-fact girls, nothing is more absurd than
your idealization of us. See how quickly and honestly I can disenchant you. In the presence
of both nature and art I am conscious that it is nearly lunch-time. You are far from your boarding-place,
so come and take your luck with us. Mamma will be glad to see you, and after lunch I may be
a more amiable critic."

"As a critic, I do not wish you to be amiable, but honest severity itself. That you stumbled
upon me accidentally in your present mood is my good fortune. Tell me the faults in my picture
in the plainest English, and I will gratefully accept your invitation; for the hospitality
at your cottage is so genial that bread and cheese would be a banquet. I have a strong fancy
for seeing my work through your eyes, and so much faith in you that I know you will tell me
what you think, since I ask you to do so."

"Why have you faith in me?" she asked, with a quick, searching glance.

"I belong somewhat to the impressionist school, and my impression of you leads to my words."

"If you compel me to be honest, I must say I'm not capable of criticising your picture. I know
little of art, and nothing of its TECHNIQUE."

"Eyes like yours should be able to see a great deal, and, as I said, I am possessed by the
wish to know just what they do see. There is the scene I was sketching, and here the canvas.
Please, Miss Marian."

"It will be your own fault, now, if you don't like what I say," laughed the young girl, with
ready tact, for a quick glance or two had already satisfied her that the picture was not to
her taste. "My only remark is this, Mr. Blauvelt,--Nature does not make the same impression
on me that it does on you. There is the scene, as you say. How can I make you understand what
I feel? Nature always looks so natural to me! It awakens within me various emotions, but never
surprise,--I mean that kind of surprise one has when seeing a lady dressed in colors that do
not harmonize. To my eye, even in gaudy October, Nature appears to blend her effects so that
there is nothing startling or incongruous."

"Is there anything startling and incongruous in my picture?"

"I have not said that. You see you have brought me into perplexity, you have taken me beyond
my depth, by insisting on having my opinion. I have read a good many art criticisms first and
last. Art is gabbled about a good deal in society, you know, and we have to keep a set of phrases
on hand, whether we understand them or not.  But since you believe in impressions, and will
have mine, it is this as nearly as I can express it. You are under the influence of a school
or a fashion in art, and perhaps unconsciously you are controlled by this when looking at the
scene there. It seems to me that if I were an artist I should try to get on my canvas the same
effects that nature produces, and I would do it after my own fashion and not after some received
method just then prevailing. Let me illustrate what I mean by a phase of life that I know more
about.  There are some girls in society whose ambition it is to dress in the latest style.
They are so devoted to fashion that they appear to forget themselves, and are happy if their
costume reflects the mode of the hour, even though it makes them look hideous. My aim would
be to suggest the style rather unobtrusively, and clothe myself becomingly. I'm too egotistical
to be ultra-fashionable. Since I, who am in love chiefly with myself, can so modify style,
much more should you, who are devoted to nature, make fashion in art subservient to nature."

"You are right. I have worked too much in studios and not enough out of doors. Ever since I
have been sketching this summer, I have had a growing dissatisfaction, and a sense of being
trammelled. I do believe, as you say, that a certain received method or fashion of treatment
has been uppermost in my mind, and I have been trying to torture--nature into conformity. I'll
paint this thing all out and begin again."

"No, don't do that. Are not pictures like people a little? If I wanted to improve in some things,
it wouldn't do for me to be painted all out. Cannot changes for the better come by softening
features here and bringing out others there, by colorings a little more like those before us,
and--pardon me--by not leaving so much to the imagination? You artists can see more between
the lines than we people can."

"Let me try;" and with eager eyes he sat down before his easel again. "Now see if I succeed
a little," he added, after a moment.

His whole nature appeared kindled and animated by hope. He worked rapidly and boldly. His drawing
had been good before, and, as time passed, nature's sweet, true face began to smile upon him
from his canvas. Marian grew almost as absorbed as himself, learning by actual vision how quick,
light strokes can reproduce and preserve on a few square inches the transitory beauty of the
hour and the season.

At times she would stimulate his effort by half-spoken sentences of satisfaction, and at last
he turned and looked up suddenly at her flushed, interested face.

"You are the muse," he exclaimed, impetuously, "who, by looking over my shoulder, can make
an artist of me."

She instinctively stepped farther away, saying, decisively, "Be careful then to regard me as
a muse."

She had replied to his ardent glance and tone, even more than to his words. There was not a
trace of sentiment in her clear, direct gaze.  The quiet dignity and reserve of her manner
sobered him instantly.  Her presence, her words, the unexpected success in the new departure
which she had suggested, had excited him deeply; yet a moment's thought made it clear that
there had been nothing on her part to warrant the hope of more than friendly interest. This
interest might easily be lost by a few rash words, while there was slight reason that he should
ever hope for anything more. Then also came the consciousness of his straitened circumstances
and the absurdity of incurring obligations which he might never be able to meet. He had assured
himself a thousand times that art should be his mistress, yet here he was on the eve of acting
like a fool by making love to one who never disguised her expensive tastes. He was not an artist
of the olden school,--all romance and passion,--and the modishly dressed, reserved maiden before
him did not, in the remotest degree, suggest a languishing heroine in days of yore, certain
to love against sense and reason. The wild, sylvan shade, the June atmosphere, the fragrance
of the eglantine, even the presence of art, in whose potent traditions mood is the highest
law, could not dispel the nineteenth century or make this independent, clear-headed American
girl forget for a moment what was sensible and right. She stood there alone under the shadow
of the chestnuts, and by a glance defined her rights, her position towards her companion, and
made him respect them. Nor was he headlong, passionate, absurd. He was a part of his age, and
was familiar with New York society. The primal instincts of his nature had obtained ascendency
for a mordent.  Ardent words to the beautiful girl who looked over his shoulder and inspired
his touch seemed as natural as breath. She had made herself for the moment a part of his enthusiasm.
But what could be the sequel of ardent words, even if successful, but prosaic explanations
and the facing of the inexorable problem of supporting two on an income that scarcely sufficed
for the Bohemian life of one?

He had sufficient self-control, and was mentally agile enough to come down upon his feet. Rising,
he said, quietly: "If you will be my muse, as far as many other claims upon your time and thoughts
permit, I shall be very grateful. I have observed that you have a good eye for harmony in color,
and, what is best of all, I have induced you to be very frank. See how much you have helped
me. In brief--Bless me! how long have you been here?"

He pulled out his watch in comic dismay, and held it towards her. "No lunch for us to-day,"
he concluded, ruefully.

"Well," exclaimed Marian, laughing, "this is the first symptom I have ever had of being an
artist. It was quite natural that you should forget the needs of sublunary mortals, but that
I should do so must prove the existence of an undeveloped trait. I could become quite absorbed
in art if I could look on and see its wonders like a child. You must come home with me and
take your chance. If lunch is over, we'll forage."

He laughingly shouldered his apparatus, and walked by her side through the June sunshine and
shade, she in the main keeping up the conversation. At last he said, rather abruptly: "Miss
Vosburgh, you do not look on like a child,--rather, with more intelligence than very many society
girls possess; and--will you forgive me?--you defend yourself like a genuine American woman.
I have lived abroad, you know, and have learned how to value such women. I wish you to know
how much I respect you, how truly I appreciate you, and how grateful and honored I shall feel
if you will be simply a frank, kind friend. You made use of the expression 'How shall I make
you understand?' So I now use it, and suggest what I mean by a question,--Is there not something
in a man's nature which enables him to do better if some woman, in whom he believes, shows
that she cares?"

"I should be glad if this were true of some men," she said, gently, "because I do care. I'll
be frank, too. Nothing would give me a more delicious sense of power than to feel that in ways
I scarcely understood I was inciting my friends to make more of themselves than they would
if they did not know me. If I cannot do a little of what you suggest, of what account am I
to my friends?"

"Your friends can serve a useful purpose by amusing you."

"Then the reverse is true, and I am merely amusing to my friends. Is that the gist of your
fine words, after all?" and her face flushed as she asked the question.

"No, it is not true, Miss Vosburgh. You have the power of entertaining your friends abundantly,
but you could make me a better artist, and that with me would mean a better man, if you took
a genuine interest in my efforts."

"I shall test the truth of your words," was her smiling response. "Meanwhile you can teach
me to understand art better, so that I shall know what I am talking about." Then she changed
the subject.

CHAPTER IX.

A GIRL'S LIGHT HAND.

ON the evening of the 3d of July Marian drove down in her phaeton to the station for her father,
and was not a little surprised to see him advancing towards her with Mr. Lane. The young man
shook hands with her cordially, yet quietly, and there was something in his expression that
assured her of the groundlessness of all the fears she had entertained.

"I have asked Mr. Lane to dine with us," said her father. "He will walk over from the hotel
in the course of half an hour."

While the gentlemen had greeted her smilingly, there had been an expression on their faces
which suggested that their minds were not engrossed by anticipation of a holiday outing. Marian
knew well what it meant. The papers had brought to every home in the land the tidings of the
awful seven days' fighting before Richmond. So far from taking the city, McClellan had barely
saved his army. Thousands of men were dead in the swamps of the Chickahominy; thousands were
dying in the sultry heat of the South and on the malarial banks of the James.

Mr. Vosburgh's face was sad and stern in its expression, and when Marian asked, "Papa, is it
so bad as the papers say?" he replied: "God only knows how bad it is. For a large part of our
army it is as bad as it can be. The most terrible feature of it all to me is that thick-headed,
blundering men are holding in their irresolute hands the destinies of just such brave young
fellows as Mr. Lane here. It is not so dreadful for a man to die if his death furthers a cause
which he believes to be sacred, but to die from the sheer stupidity and weakness of his leaders
is a bitter thing. Instead of brave action, there is fatal blundering all along the line. For
a long time the President, sincere and true-hearted as he is, could not learn that he is not
a military man, and he has permitted a large part of our armies to be scattered all over Virginia.
They have accomplished next to nothing. McClellan long since proved that he would not advance
without men enough to walk over everything. He is as heavy as one of his own siege guns. He
may be sure, if he has all he wants, but is mortally slow, and hadn't brains enough to realize
that the Chickahominy swamps thinned his army faster than brave fighting. He should have been
given the idle, useless men under McDowell and others, and then ordered to take Richmond. If
he wouldn't move, then they should have put a man in his place who would, and not one who would
sit down and dig. At last he has received an impetus from Richmond, instead of Washington,
and he has moved at a lively pace, but to the rear. His men were as brave as men could be;
and if the courage shown on the retreat, or change of base, as some call it, had been manifested
in an advance, weeks ago, Richmond would have been ours. The 'change of base' has carried us
well away from the point attacked, brave men have suffered and died in vain, and the future
is so clouded that only one thing is certain."

"What is that, papa?" was the anxious query.

"We must never give up. We must realize that we are confronting some of the best soldiers and
generals the world has known. The North is only half awake to its danger and the magnitude
of its task. We have sent out comparatively few of our men to do a disagreeable duty for us,
while we take life comfortably and luxuriously as before. The truth will come home to us soon,
that we are engaged in a life-and-death struggle."

"Papa, these events will bring no changes to you? In your work, I mean?"

"Not at present. I truly believe, Marian, that I can serve my country more effectively in the
performance of the duties with which I am now charged. But who can tell what a day will bring
forth? Lane is going to the front. He will tell you all about it. He is a manly fellow, and
no doubt will explain why you have not heard from him."

"Real life has come in very truth," thought Marian, as she went to her room to prepare for
dinner; "but on every side it also brings the thought of death."

Her face was pale, and clouded with apprehension, when she joined the gentlemen; but Lane was
so genial and entertaining at dinner as to make it difficult for her to believe that he had
resolved on a step so fraught with risk. When at last they were alone in the drawing-room she
said, "Is it true that you intend to enter the army?"

"Yes, and it is time that it was true," was his smiling reply.

"I don't feel like laughing, Mr. Lane. Going to Virginia does not strike me as a pleasure excursion.
I have thought a great deal since I saw you last. You certainly have kept your promise to be
a distant and absent friend."

He looked at her eagerly, as he said, "You have thought a great deal--have you thought about me?"

"Certainly," she replied, with a slight flush; "I meant all that I said that evening."

That little emphasized word dispelled the hope that had for a moment asserted itself. Time
and a better acquaintance with her own heart had not brought any change of feeling to her,
and after a moment he said, quietly: "I think I can prove that I have been a sincere and loyal
friend as well as an absent one. Having never felt--well, you cannot know--it takes a little
time for a fellow to--pardon me; let all that go. I have tried to gain self-control, and I
have obeyed your request, to do nothing rash, literally. I remained steadily at work in my
office a certain number of hours every day. If the general hope that Richmond would be taken,
and the war practically ended, had proved well founded, for the sake of others I should have
resisted my inclination to take part in the struggle. I soon concluded, however, that it would
be just as well to prepare for what has taken place, and so gave part of my afternoons and
evenings to a little useful training. I am naturally very fond of a horse, and resolved that
if I went at all it should be as a cavalry-man, so I have been giving not a little of my time
to horseback exercise, sabre, pistol, and carbine practice, and shall not be quite so awkward
as some of the other raw recruits. I construed McClellan's retreat into an order for me to
advance, and have come to you as soon as I could to report progress."

"Why could you not have come before?--why could you not have told me?" she asked, a little
reproachfully.

"Some day perhaps you will know," he replied, turning away for a moment.

"I feared that maturer thought had convinced you that I could not be much of a friend,--that
I was only a gay young girl who wouldn't appreciate an earnest man's purposes."

"Miss Marian, you wrong me in thinking that I could so wrong you. Never for a moment have I
entertained such a thought. I can't explain to you all my experience. I wished to be more sure
of myself, to have something definite to tell you, that would prove me more worthy of your
friendship."

"My faith in you has never faltered a moment, Mr. Lane. While your words make me proud indeed,
they also make me very sad. I don't wonder that you feel as you do about going, and were I
a man I should probably take the same course. But I am learning at last what this war means.
I can't with a light heart see my friends go."

"Let it be with a brave heart, then. There are tears in your eyes, Miss Marian."

"Why should there not be? O Mr. Lane, I am not coldhearted and callous. I am not so silly and
shallow as I seemed."

"I never thought you so--"

By a gesture she stopped him, as she continued: "I recognized the expression on papa's face
and yours the moment I saw you, and I know what it means."

"Yes, Miss Marian; and I recognize the expression on your face. Were you a man you would have
gone before this."

"I think it would be easier to go than to stay and think of all one's friends must face."

"Of course it would be for one like you. You must not look on the dark side, however. You will
scarcely find a jollier set of men than our soldiers."

"I fear too many are reckless. This you have promised me not to be."

"I shall keep my promise; but a soldier must obey orders, you know. O Miss Marian, it makes
such a difference with me to know that you care so much! Knowing you as I do now, it would
seem like black treason to do or be anything unmanly."

Callers were now announced, and before an hour had passed there were half a dozen or more young
men in the drawing-room. Some were staying at the hotel, but the majority were from the villas
in the neighborhood, the holiday season permitting the return of those in business. However
dark and crimson might be the tide of thought that flowed through the minds of those present,
in memory of what had occurred during the last few days, the light of mirth played on the surface.
The times afforded themes for jest, rather than doleful predictions. Indeed, in accordance
with a principle in human nature, there was a tendency to disguise feelings and anxiety by
words so light as to border on recklessness. Questions as to future action were coming home
to all the young men, but not for the world would they permit one another, or especially a
spirited young girl, to suspect that they were awed, or made more serious even, by the thought
that the battle was drawing nearer to them. Lane was a leader in the gayety. His presence was
regarded by some with both surprise and surmise. It had been thought that he had disappeared
finally below Miss Vosburgh's horizon, but his animated face and manner gave no indication
of a rejected and despondent suitor.

The mirth was at its height when Strahan entered, dressed plainly in the uniform of a second
lieutenant. He was greeted with a shout of laughter by the young men, who knew him well, and
by a cordial pressure from Marian's hand. This made the gauntlet which he knew he must run
of little consequence to him. All except Lane drew up and gave him a military salute.

"Pretty fair for the awkward squad," he remarked, coolly.

"Come, report, report," cried several voices; "where have you been?"

"In Virginia."

"Why, of course, fellows, he's been arranging the change of base with McClellan, only the army
went south and he came north."

"I've been farther south than any of you."

"See here, Strahan, this uniform is rather new for a veteran's."

"Yes; never dealt in old clothes."

"Where's your command?"

"Here, if you'll all enlist. I think I could make soldiers of some of you."

"Why, fellows, what a chance for us! If Strahan can't teach us the etiquette of war, who can?"

"Yes, gentlemen; and I will give you the first rule in advance. Always face the music."

"Dance music, you mean. Strahan has been at West Point and knows that a fellow in civilian
togs stands no chance. How he eclipses us all to-night with the insignia of rank on his shoulders!
Where will you make headquarters?"

"At home, for the present."

"That's right. We knew you would hit upon the true theory of campaigning. Never was there a
better strategic point for your operations, Strahan, than the banks of the Hudson."

"I shall try to prove you right. A recruiting sergeant will join me in a day or two, and then
I can accommodate you all with muskets."

"All? Not Miss Marian?"

"Those possessing her rank and influence do not carry muskets."

"Come, fellows, let us celebrate the 4th by enlisting under Strahan," cried the chief spokesman,
who was not a very friendly neighbor of the young officer. "It won't be long before we shall
know all the gossip of the Confederacy."

"You will certainly have to approach near enough to receive some very direct news."

"Gentlemen," cried Marian, "a truce! Mr. Strahan has proved that he can face a hot fire, and
send back good shots, even when greatly outnumbered. I have such faith in him that I have already
given him my colors. You may take my word for it that he will render a good account of himself.
I am now eager to hear of his adventures."

"I haven't had any, Miss Marian. What I said about Virginia was mere bluff,--merely made an
excursion or two on the Virginia side of the Potomac, out of curiosity."

"But what does this uniform mean?"

"Merely what it suggests. I went to Washington, which is a great camp, you know. Through relatives
I had some influence there, and at last obtained a commission at the bottom of the ladder in
a new regiment that is to be recruited. Meanwhile I was put through the manual of arms, with
a lot of other awkward fellows, by a drill officer. I kept shady and told my people to be mum
until something came out of it all. Come, fellows, thirteen dollars a month, hard tack, and
glory! Don't all speak at once!"

"I'm with you as far as going is concerned," said Lane, shaking Strahan's hand warmly, "only
I've decided on the cavalry."

"Were I a man, you should have one recruit for your regiment to-night," said Marian. "You have
gone to work in a way that inspires confidence."

"I foresee, fellows, that we shall all have to go, or else Miss Marian will cross us out of
her books," remarked one of the young men.

"No, indeed," she replied. "I would not dare urge any one to go. But those who, like Mr. Lane
and Mr. Strahan, decide the question for themselves, cannot fail to carry my admiration with them."

"That's the loudest bugle call I expect to hear," remarked Mr. Blauvelt, who entered at that
moment.

"Here's the place to open your recruiting-office," added another, laughing. "If Miss Marian
would be free with her colors, she could raise a brigade."

"I can assure you beforehand that I shall not be free with them; much less will I hold them
out as an inducement. Slight as may be their value, they must be earned."

"What chivalrous deed has Strahan performed?" was asked, in chorus.

"One that I appreciate, and I don't give my faith lightly,"

"Mr. Strahan, I congratulate you," said Lane, with a swift and somewhat reproachful glance
at Marian; "you have already achieved your best laurels."

"I've received them, but not earned them yet. Miss Marian gives a fellow a good send-off, however,
and time will tell the story with us all. I must now bid you good-evening," he said to the
young girl. "I merely stopped for a few moments on my way from the train."

She followed him to the door, and said, sotto voce: "You held your own splendidly. Your first
report is more than satisfactory;" and he departed happier than any major-general in the service.

When the rest had gone, Lane, who had persistently lingered, began: "No doubt it will appear
absurd to you that a friend should be jealous. But Strahan seems to have won the chief honors."

"Perhaps he has deserved them, Mr. Lane. I know what your opinion of him was, and I think you
guessed mine. He has won the chief battle of life,--victory over himself. Ever since I have
known you, you have inspired my respect as a strong, resolute man. In resolving upon what you
would do instinctively Mr. Strahan has had such a struggle that he has touched my sympathies.
One cannot help feeling differently toward different friends, you know. Were I in trouble,
I should feel that I could lean upon you. To encourage and sustain would always be my first
impulse with Mr. Strahan. Are you content?"

"I should try to be, had I your colors also."

"Oh, I only gave him a rose. Do you want one?"

"Certainly."

"Well, now you are even," she said, laughing, and handing him one of those she wore.

He looked at it thoughtfully for a moment, and then said, quietly: "Some would despise this
kind of thing as the merest sentiment. With others it would influence the sternest action and
the supreme moments of life."

CHAPTER X.

WILLARD MERWYN. 

This is made good by experience, which can from the ashes of a plant revive the plant, and from
its cinders recall it into its stalk and leaves again.<67> What the art of man can do in these
inferior pieces, what blasphemy is it to affirm the finger of God cannot do in those more perfect
and sensible structures?

This is that mystical philosophy, from whence no true scholar becomes an atheist, but from the
visible effects of nature grows up a real divine, and beholds not
in a dream, as Ezekiel, but in an ocular and visible object, the types
of his resur- rection.

<i>Sect.</i> 49.--Now, the necessary mansions of our restored selves
are those two contrary and incompatible places we call heaven and
hell.

To define them, or strictly to determine what
and where these are, surpasseth my divinity. That elegant apostle, which
seemed to have a glimpse of heaven, hath left but a negative descrip- tion
thereof; which "neither eye hath seen, nor ear hath heard, nor can
enter into the heart of man:" he was translated out of himself to
behold it; but, being re- turned into himself, could not express it.

Saint John's description by emeralds, chrysolites, and precious stones, is too weak to express
the material heaven we behold. Briefly, therefore, where the soul hath
the full measure and complement of happiness; where the boundless appetite
of that spirit remains completely satisfied that it can neither desire addition
nor alteration; that, I think, is truly heaven: and this can only be in
the enjoyment of that essence, whose infinite goodness is able to
terminate the desires of itself, and the unsatiable wishes of ours.

Wherever God will thus manifest him- self, there is heaven, though within the circle of this sensible
world.

Thus, the soul of man may be in heaven anywhere, even within the limits of his own proper body;
and when it ceaseth to live in the body it may remain in its own soul, that is, its Creator.
And thus we may say that Saint Paul, whether in the body or out of
the body, was yet in heaven. To place it in the empyreal, or beyond the
tenth sphere, is to forget the world's destruction; for when this sensible
world shall be destroyed, all shall then be here as it is now there,
an empyreal heaven, a <i>quasi</i> vacuity; when to ask where heaven is,
is to demand where the presence of God is, or where we have the glory
of that happy vision.

Moses, that was bred up in all the learning of the Egyptians, committed a gross absurdity in philo- sophy,
when with these eyes of flesh he desired to see God, and petitioned
his Maker, that is truth itself, to a contra- diction.

Those that imagine heaven and hell neighbours, and conceive a vicinity
between those two extremes, upon consequence of the parable, where
Dives discoursed with Lazarus, in Abraham's bosom, do too grossly
con- ceive of those glorified creatures, whose eyes shall easily out-see
the sun, and behold without perspective the extremest distances: for
if there shall be, in our glori- fied eyes, the faculty of sight and
reception of objects, I could think the visible species there to be
in as un- limitable a way as now the intellectual.

I grant that two bodies placed beyond the tenth sphere, or in a vacuity,
according to Aristotle's philosophy, could not behold each other,
because there wants a body or medium to hand and transport the visible
rays of the object unto the sense; but when there shall be a general
defect of either medium to convey, or light to prepare and dispose
that medium, and yet a perfect vision, we must suspend the rules of
our philosophy, and make all good by a more absolute piece of opticks.

<i>Sect.</i>
50.--I cannot tell how to say that fire is the essence of hell; I know
not what to make of purgatory, or conceive a flame that can either
prey upon, or purify the substance of a soul.

Those flames of sulphur, men- tioned in the scriptures, I take not to
be understood of this present hell, but of that to come, where fire shall
make up the complement of our tortures, and have a body or subject whereon to
manifest its tyranny. Some who have had the honour to be textuary in
divinity are of opinion it shall be the same specifical fire with
ours.

This is hard to conceive, yet can I make good how even that may prey upon
our bodies, and yet not consume us: for in this material world, there
are bodies that persist invincible in the powerfulest flames; and though,
by the action of fire, they fall into ignition and liquation, yet
will they never suffer a destruction.

I would gladly know how Moses, with an actual fire, calcined or burnt the golden calf into powder:
for that mystical metal of gold, whose solary and celestial nature I
admire, ex- posed unto the violence of fire, grows only hot, and liquefies,
but consumeth not; so when the consumable and volatile pieces of our bodies
shall be refined into a more impregnable and fixed temper, like gold,
though they suffer from the action of flames, they shall never perish,
but lie immortal in the arms of fire. And surely, if this flame must
suffer only by the action of this element, there will many bodies
escape; and not only heaven, but earth will not be at an end, but
rather a beginning.

For at present it is not earth, but a composition of fire, water, earth, and air; but at that time,
spoiled of these ingredients, it shall appear in a substance more like
itself, its ashes. Philosophers that opinioned the world's destruction
by fire, did never dream of annihilation, which is beyond the power
of sublunary causes; for the last and proper action of that element
is but vitrification, or a reduction of a body into glass; and therefore
some of our chymicks facetiously affirm, that, at the last fire,
all shall be crystalized and reverberated into glass, which is the
utmost action of that element.

Nor need we fear this
term, annihilation, or wonder that God will destroy the works of his
crea- tion: for man subsisting, who is, and will then truly appear,
a microcosm, the world cannot be said to be destroyed.

For the eyes of God, and perhaps also of our glorified selves, shall
as really behold and contem- plate the world, in its epitome or contracted
essence, as now it doth at large and in its dilated substance. In
the seed of a plant, to the eyes of God, and to the under- standing
of man, there exists, though in an invisible way, the perfect leaves,
flowers, and fruit thereof; for things that are in <i>posse</i> to
the sense, are actually existent to the understanding.

Thus God beholds all things, who contemplates as fully his works in their epitome as in their full volume,
and beheld as amply the whole world, in that little compendium of the sixth day, as in the
scattered and dilated pieces of those five before.

<i>Sect.</i> 51.--Men commonly set forth the torments of hell by fire, and
the extremity of corporal afflictions, and describe hell in the same
method that Mahomet doth heaven.

This indeed
makes a noise, and drums in popular ears: but if this be the terrible
piece thereof, it is not worthy to stand in diameter with heaven, whose
happiness consists in that part that is best able to com- prehend it,
that immortal essence, that translated divinity and colony of God, the soul.
Surely, though we place hell under earth, the devil's walk and purlieu is
about it. Men speak too popularly who place it in those flaming mountains,
which to grosser apprehensions re- present hell.

The heart of man is the place the devils dwell in; I feel sometimes
a hell within myself; Lucifer keeps his court in my breast; Legion is
revived in me. There are as many hells as Anaxagoras<68> conceited
worlds.

There was more than one hell in Magdalene, when there were seven
devils; for every devil is an hell unto himself,<69> he holds enough
of torture in his own <i>ubi</i>; and needs not the misery of cir- cumference
to afflict him: and thus, a distracted con- science here is a shadow
or introduction unto hell here- after.

Who can but pity the merciful intention of those hands that do destroy
themselves? The devil, were it in his power, would do the like; which
being im- possible, his miseries are endless, and he suffers most in that attribute
wherein he is impassible, his im- mortality.

<i>Sect.</i> 52.--I thank God, and with joy I mention it, I was never
afraid of hell, nor ever grew pale at the description of that place.

I have so fixed my contempla- tions on heaven, that I have almost forgot the
idea of hell; and am afraid rather to lose the joys of the one, than
endure the misery of the other: to be deprived of them is a perfect
hell, and needs methinks no addition to complete our afflictions.

That terrible term hath never detained me from sin, nor do I owe any
good action to the name thereof. I fear God, yet am not afraid of him; his
mercies make me ashamed of my sins, before his judgments afraid thereof:
these are the forced and secondary method of his wisdom, which he
useth but as the last remedy, and upon provocation;-- a course rather
to deter the wicked, than incite the virtuous to his worship.

I can hardly think there was ever any scared into heaven: they go the
fairest way to heaven that would serve God without a hell: other mercenaries,
that crouch unto him in fear of hell, though they term themselves
the servants, are indeed but the slaves, of the Almighty.

<i>Sect.</i> 53.--And to be true, and speak my soul, when I survey the
occurrences of my life, and call into account the finger of God, I can
perceive nothing but an abyss and mass of mercies, either in general
to mankind, or in particular to myself.

And, whether out of the prejudice of my affection, or an inverting
and partial conceit of his mercies, I know not,--but those which
others term crosses, afflictions, judgments, misfortunes, to me, who
inquire further into them than their visible effects, they both appear,
and in event have ever proved, the secret and dissembled favours of
his affection.

It is a singular piece
of wisdom to apprehend truly, and without passion, the works of God,
and so well to distinguish his justice from his mercy as not to miscall
those noble attributes; yet it is likewise an honest piece of logick
so to dispute and argue the proceedings of God as to distinguish even
his judgments into mercies.

For God is merciful unto all, because better to the worst than the
best deserve; and to say he punisheth none in this world, though it
be a paradox, is no absurdity. To one that hath com- mitted murder, if
the judge should only ordain a fine, it were a madness to call this
a punishment, and to re- pine at the sentence, rather than admire
the clemency of the judge.

Thus, our
offences being mortal, and deserving not only death but damnation, if the goodness of God be content
to traverse and pass them over with a loss, misfortune, or disease; what frenzy were it to term this
a punishment, rather than an extremity of mercy, and to groan under
the rod of his judgments rather than admire the sceptre of his mercies!
There- fore to adore, honour, and admire him, is a debt of gratitude
due from the obligation of our nature, states, and conditions: and
with these thoughts he that knows them best will not deny that I adore
him.

That I obtain heaven, and the bliss thereof, is accidental, and not
the intended work of my devotion; it being a felicity I can neither
think to deserve nor scarce in modesty to expect.

For these two ends of us all, either as rewards or punishments,
are mercifully ordained and disproportionably disposed unto our actions;
the one being so far beyond our deserts, the other so infinitely below
our demerits.

<i>Sect.</i> 54.--There is no salvation to those that believe not
in Christ; that is, say some, since his nativity, and, as divinity
affirmeth, before also; which makes me much apprehend the end of
those honest worthies and philosophers which died before his incarnation.

It is hard to place those souls in hell, whose worthy lives do teach us
virtue on earth.

Methinks, among those many subdivisions of hell, there might have been
one limbo left for these. What a strange vision will it be to see their poetical
fictions converted into verities, and their imagined and fancied
furies into real devils!

How strange to them
will sound the history of Adam, when they shall suffer for him they
never heard of!

When they who derive their genealogy from the gods, shall know they
are the unhappy issue of sinful man! It is an insolent part of reason,
to controvert the works of God, or question the justice of his proceedings.
Could humility teach others, as it hath instructed me, to con- template
the infinite and incomprehensible distance be- twixt the Creator and
the creature; or did we seriously perpend that one simile of St Paul,
"shall the vessel say to the potter, why hast thou made me thus?"
it would prevent these arrogant disputes of reason: nor would we argue
the definitive sentence of God, either to heaven or hell.

Men that live according to the right rule and law of reason, live
but in their own kind, as beasts do in theirs; who justly obey the
prescript of their natures, and therefore cannot reasonably demand
a reward of their actions, as only obeying the natural dictates of
their reason.

It will, therefore, and must, at last appear, that all salvation is through Christ; which verity,
I fear, these great examples of virtue must con- firm, and make it
good how the perfectest actions of earth have no title or claim unto heaven.

<i>Sect.</i>
55.--Nor truly do I think the lives of these, or of any other, were ever
correspondent, or in all points conformable, unto their doctrines.
It is evident that Aristotle transgressed the rule of his own ethicks;<70>
the stoicks, that condemn passion, and command a man to laugh in Phalaris's<71>
bull, could not endure without a groan a fit of the stone or colick.

The scepticks, that affirmed they knew nothing,<72> even in that opinion
con- fute themselves, and thought they knew more than all the world
beside. Diogenes I hold to be the most vain- glorious man of his time,
and more ambitious in refus- ing all honours, than Alexander in rejecting
none.

Vice and the devil
put a fallacy upon our reasons; and, provoking us too hastily to run from it, entangle
and profound us deeper in it. The duke of Venice, that weds himself unto
the sea, by a ring of gold,<73> I will not accuse of prodigality, because it
is a solemnity of good use and consequence in the state: but the
philoso- pher, that threw his money into the sea to avoid avarice,
was a notorious prodigal.<74> There is no road or ready way to virtue;
it is not an easy point of art to dis- entangle ourselves from this
riddle or web of sin.

To perfect virtue, as to religion, there is required a <i>panoplia</i>, or complete armour;
that whilst we lie at close ward against one vice, we lie not open to the
veney<75> of another. And indeed wiser discretions, that have the
thread of reason to conduct them, offend without a pardon; whereas under
heads may stumble without dishonour. There go so many circumstances
to piece up one good action, that it is a lesson to be good, and
we are forced to be virtuous by the book. Again, the practice of men
holds not an equal pace, yea and often runs counter to their theory;
we naturally know what is good, but naturally pursue what is evil:
the rhetorick wherewith I persuade another cannot persuade myself.

There is a depraved appetite in us, that will with patience hear the
learned instructions of reason, but yet perform no further than
agrees to its own irregular humour. In brief, we all are monsters;
that is, a com- position of man and beast: wherein we must endeavour to be
as the poets fancy that wise man, Chiron; that is, to have the region
of man above that of beast, and sense to sit but at the feet of reason.

 We ought to return to New York at once and have the necessary
papers made out."

In vain she protested that the property was well managed, that the income was received regularly,
that he could have this, and that it would be intensely disagreeable for her to visit New York.
He, who had yielded indifferently to all her little exactions, was inexorable, and the proud,
self-willed woman found that he had so much law and reason on his side that she was compelled
to submit.

Indeed, she at last felt that she had been unduly governed by her prejudices, and that it might
be wise to go and see for themselves that their affairs were managed to the best advantage.
Deep in her heart was also the consciousness that it was her husband's indomitable will that
she was carrying out, and that she could never escape from that will in any exigency where
it could justly make itself felt. She therefore required of her son the promise that their
visit should be as unobtrusive as possible, and that he would return with her as soon as he
had arranged matters to his mind. To this he had readily agreed, and they were now in the land
for which the mother had only hate and the son indifference.

CHAPTER XI.

AN OATH AND A GLANCE.

As Strahan disappeared in the winding of the avenue a sudden and terrible thought occurred
to Mrs. Merwyn. She glanced at her son, who had walked to the farther end of the piazza, and
stood for a moment with his back towards her. His manly proportions made her realize, as she
had never done before, that he had attained his majority,--that he was his own master. He had
said he would not fight against the North, but, as far as the South was concerned, he had never
committed himself. And then his terrible will!

She went to her room and thought. He was in a land seething with excitement and patriotic fervor.
She knew not what influences a day might bring to bear upon him. Above all else she feared
taunts for lack of courage. She knew that her own passionate pride slept in his breast and
on a few occasions she had seen its manifestations. As a rule he was too healthful, too well
organized and indolent, to be easily irritated, while in serious matters he had not been crossed.
She knew enough of life to be aware that his manhood had never been awakened or even deeply
moved, and she was eager indeed to accomplish their mission in the States and return to conditions
of life not so electrical.

In the mean time she felt that she must use every precaution. She summoned a maid and asked
that her son should be sent to her.

The young man soon lounged in, and threw himself into an easy chair.

His mother looked at him fixedly for a moment, and then asked, "Why is young Strahan in THAT
uniform?"

"I didn't ask him," was the careless reply. "Obviously, however, because he has entered the
service in some capacity."

"Did he not suggest that it would be a very proper thing for you to do, also?"

"Oh, of course. He wouldn't be Strahan if he hadn't. He has a high appreciation of a 'little
brief authority,' especially if vested in himself. Believing himself to be so heroic he is
inclined to call others to account."

"I trust you have rated such vaporings at their worth."

"I have not rated them at all. What do I care for little Strahan or his opinions? Nil."

"Shall you see much of him while we are compelled to remain in this detestable land?"

"More of him than of any one else, probably. We were boys together, and he amuses me. What
is more to the point, if I make a Union officer my associate I disarm hostile criticism and
throw an additional safeguard around my property. There is no telling to what desperate straits
the Northern authorities may be reduced, and I don't propose to give them any grounds for confiscation."

"You are remarkably prudent, Willard, for a young man of Southern descent."

"I am of Northern descent also," he replied, with a light laugh. "Father was as strong a Northern
man--so I imagine--as you are a Southern woman, and so, by a natural law, I am neutral, brought
to a standstill by two equal and opposite forces."

The intense partisan looked at him with perplexity, and for a moment felt a strange and almost
superstitious belief in his words. Was there a reciprocal relation of forces which would render
her schemes futile? She shared in the secret hopes and ambitions of the Southern leaders. Had
Northern and Southern blood so neutralized the heart of this youth that he was indifferent
to both sections? and had she, by long residence abroad, and indulgence, made him so cosmopolitan
that he merely looked upon the world as "his oyster"? She was not the first parent who, having
failed to instil noble, natural principles in childhood, is surprised and troubled at the outcome
of a mind developing under influences unknown or unheeded. That the South would be triumphant
she never doubted a moment. It would not merely achieve independence, but also a power that
would grow like the vegetation of its genial climate, and extend until the tapering Isthmus
of Panama became the national boundary of the empire. But what part would be taken by this
strange son who seemed equally endowed with graceful indolence and indomitable will? Were his
tireless strength and energy to accomplish nothing better than the climbing of distant mountains?
and would he maintain indifference towards a struggle for a dominion beyond Oriental dreams?
Physically and mentally he seemed capable of doing what he chose; practically he chose to do
what he pleased from hour to hour. Amusing himself with a languid, good-natured disregard of
what he looked upon as trivial affairs, he was like adamant the moment a supreme and just advantage
was his. He was her husband over agaim, with strange differences. What could she do at the
present moment but the thing she proposed to do?

"Willard," she said, slowly, and in a voice that pierced his indifference, "have you any regard
for me?"

"Certainly. Have I shown any want of respect?"

"That is not the question at all. You are young, Willard, and you live in the future. I live
much in the past. My early home was in the South, where my family, for generations, has been
eminent. Is it strange, then, that I should love that sunny land?"

"No, mamma."

"Well, all I ask at present is that you will promise me never, under any motive, to take up
arms against that land of my ancestors."

"I have not the slightest disposition to do so."

"Willard, what to-day is, is. Neither you nor I know what shall be on the morrow. I never expected
to marry a Northern man, yet I did so; nor should I regret it if I consulted my heart only.
He was different from all his race. I did not foresee what was coming, or I could have torn
my heart out before involving myself in these Northern complications. I cannot change the past,
but I must provide for the future. O Willard, to your eyes your Northern fortune seems large.
But a few years will pass before you will be shown what a trifle it is compared with the prizes
of power and wealth that will be bestowed upon loyal Southerners. You have an ancestry, an
ability, that would naturally place you among the foremost. Terrible as would be the sacrifice
on my part, I could still give you my blessing if you imitated young Strahan in one respect,
and devoted yourself heart, soul, and sword to our cause."

"The probable result would be that you and my sisters would be penniless, I sleeping in mud,
and living on junk and hoe-cake. Another result, probable, only a little more remote, is that
the buzzards would pick my bones. Faugh! Oh, no. I've settled that question, and it's a bore
to think a question over twice. There are thousands of Americans in Europe. Their wisdom suits
me until this tea-pot tempest is over. If any one doubts my courage I'll prove it fast enough,
but, if I had my way, the politicians, North and South, should do their own fighting and starving."

"But, Willard, our leaders are not mere politicians. They are men of grand, far-reaching schemes,
and when their plans are accomplished, they will attain regal power and wealth."

"Visions, mamma, visions. I have enough of my father's blood in my veins to be able to look
at both sides of a question. Strahan asked me severely if I did not read the papers;" and he
laughed lightly.  "Well, I do read them, at least enough of them to pick out a few grains of
truth from all the chaff. The North and South have begun fighting like two bull-dogs, and it's
just a question which has the longer wind and the more endurance. The chances are all in favor
of the North. I shall not throw myself and property away for the sake of a bare possibility.
That's settled."

"Have you ice-water in your veins?" his mother asked, passionately.

"I have your blood, madam, and my father's, hence I am what I am."

"Well, then you must be a man of honor, of your word. Will you promise never to take arms against
the South?"

"I have told you I have no disposition to do so."

"The promise, then, can cost you little, and it will be a relief to my mind."

"Oh, well, mamma, if it will make you feel any easier, I promise with one exception. Both South
and North must keep their hands off the property my father gave me."

"If Southern leaders were dictating terms in New York City, as they will, ere long, they would
never touch your property."

"They had better not."

"You know what I mean, Willard. I ask you never to assume this hated Northern uniform, or put
your foot on Southern soil with a hostile purpose."

"Yes, I can promise that."

"Swear it to me then, by your mother's honor and your father's memory."

"Is not my word sufficient?"

"These things are sacred to me, and I wish them treated in a sacred manner. If you will do
this my mind will be at rest and I may be able to do more for you in the future."

"To satisfy you, I swear never to put on the Northern uniform or to enter the South with a
hostile purpose."

She stepped forward and touched his forehead with her lips, as she said: "The compact is sealed.
Your oath is registered on earth and in heaven. Your simple word as a man of honor will satisfy
me as to one other request. I wish you never to speak to any one of this solemn covenant between
us."

"I'm not in the habit of gossiping over family affairs," he replied, haughtily.

"I know that, and also that your delicacy of feeling would keep you from speaking of a matter
so sacred to me. But I am older and more experienced than you, and I shall feel safer if you
promise. You would not gossip about it, of course. You might refer to it to some friend or
to the woman who became your wife. I can foresee complications which might make it better that
it should be utterly unknown. You little know how I dream and plan for you, and I only ask
you never to speak of this interview and its character to a living soul."

"Certainly, mother, I can promise this. I should feel it small business to babble about anything
which you take so to heart. These visions of empire occupy your mind and do no harm. I only
hope you will meet your disappointment philosophically. Good-by now till lunch."

"Poor mamma!" thought the young man, as he started out for a walk; "she rails against Northern
fanatics, forgetting tnat it is just possible to be a little fanatical on the Southern side
of the line."

As he strode along in the sunshine his oath weighed upon him no more than if he had promised
not to go out in his sail-boat that day.

At last, after surmounting a rather steep hill, he threw himself on the grass under the shade
of a tree. "It's going to be awfully slow and stupid here," he muttered, "and it will be a
month or two before we can return. I hoped to be back in time to join the Montagues in climbing
Mont Blanc, and here I am tied up between these mole-hill mountains and city law-offices. How
shall I ever get through with the time?"

A pony-phaeton, containing two ladies, appeared at the foot of the hill and slowly approached.
His eyes rested on it in languid indifference, but, as it drew nearer, the younger of the two
ladies fixed his attention. Her charming summer costume at first satisfied his taste, and,
as her features became distinct, he was surprised at their beauty, as he thought at first;
but he soon felt that animation redeemed the face from mere prettiness. The young girl was
talking earnestly, but a sudden movement of the horse caused her to glance toward the road-side,
and she encountered the dark eyes of a stranger. Her words ceased instantly. A slight frown
contracted her brow, and, touching her horse with her whip, she passed on rapidly.

"By Jove! Strahan is right. If I have many such countrywomen in the neighborhood, I ought to
find amusement."

He rose and sauntered after the phaeton, and saw that it turned in at a pretty little cottage,
embowered in vines and trees. Making a mental note of the locality, he bent his steps in another
direction, laughing as he thought: "From that one glance I am sure that those blue eyes will
kindle more than one fellow before they are quenched. I wonder if Strahan knows her. Well,
here, perhaps, is a chance for a summer lark. If Strahan is enamored I'd like to cut him out,
for by all the fiends of dulness I must find something to do."

Strahan had accepted an invitation to lunch at the Vosburghs' that day, and arrived, hot and
flushed, from his second morning's drill.

"Well!" he exclaimed, "I've seen the great Mogul."

"I believe I have also," replied Marian. "Has he not short and slightly curly hair, dark eyes,
and an impudent stare?"

"I don't recognize the 'stare' exactly. Merwyn is polite enough in his way, and confound his
way! But the rest of your description tallies. Where did you see him?"

She explained.

"That was he, accomplishing his usual day's work. O ye dogs of war! how I would like to have
him in my squad one of these July days! Miss Marian, I'd wear your shoe-tie in my cap the rest
of my life, if you would humble that fellow and make him feel that he never spoke to a titled
lady abroad who had not her equal in some American girl. It just enrages me to see a New-York
man, no better born than myself, putting on such superior and indifferent airs. If he'd come
to me and say, 'Strahan, I'm a rebel, I'm going to fight and kill you if I can,' I'd shake
hands with him as I did not to-day. I'd treat him like a jolly, square fellow, until we came
face to face in a fair fight, and then--the fortune of war. As it was, I felt like taking him
by the collar and shaking him out of his languid grace.  He told me to mind my own business
so politely that I couldn't take offence, although he gave scarcely any other reason than that
he proposed to mind his. When I met his Southern mother on the piazza, she looked at me in
my uniform at first as if I had been a toad.  They are rebels at heart, and yet they stand
aloof and sneer at the North, from which they derive protection and revenue. I made his eyes
flash once though," chuckled the young fellow in conclusion.

Marian laughed heartily as she said: "Mr. Strahan, if you fight as well as you talk, I foresee
Southern reverses. You have no idea how your indignation becomes you. 'As well-born,' did you
say? Why, my good friend, you are worth a wilderness of such lackadaisical fellows. Ciphers
don't count unless they stand after a significant figure; neither do such men, unless stronger
men use them."

"Your arithmetic is at fault, Miss Marian. Ciphers do have the power of pushing a significant
figure way back to the right of the decimal point, and, as a practical fact, these elegant
human ciphers usually stand before good men and true in society. I don't believe it would be
so with you, but few of us would stand a chance with most girls should this rich American,
with his foreign airs and graces, enter the lists against us."

In her sincerity and earnestness, she took his hand and said: "I thank you for your tribute.
You are right. Though this person had the wealth of the Indies, and every external grace, he
could not be my friend unless he were a MAN. I've talked with papa a good deal, and believe
there are men in the Southern army just as honest and patriotic as you are; but no cold-blooded,
selfish betwixt-and-betweens shall ever take my hand."

"Make me a promise," cried Strahan, giving the hand he held a hearty and an approving shake.

"Well?"

"If opportunity offers, make this fellow bite the dust."

"We'll see about that. I may not think it worth the while, and I certainly shall not compromise
myself in the slightest degree."

"But if I bring him here you will be polite to him?"

"Just about as polite as he was to you, I imagine."

"Miss Marian, I wouldn't have any harm come to you for the wide world. If--if anything should
turn out amiss I'd shoot him, I certainly would."

The girl's only answer was a merry peal of laughter.

CHAPTER XII.

"A VOW."

BENT, as was Strahan, upon his scheme of disturbing Merwyn's pride and indifference, he resolved
to permit several days to pass before repeating his call. He also, as well as Marian, was unwilling
to compromise himself beyond a certain point, and it was his hope that he might receive a speedy
visit. He was not disappointed, for on the ensuing day Merwyn sauntered up the Strahan avenue,
and, learning that the young officer had gone to camp, followed him thither. The cold glance
from the fair stranger in the phaeton dwelt in his memory, and he was pleased to find that
it formed sufficient incentive to action.

Strahan saw him coming with a grim smile, but greeted him with off-hand cordiality. "Sorry,
Merwyn," he said, "I can give you only a few moments before I go on duty."

"You are not on duty evenings?"

"Yes, every other evening."

"How about to-night?"

"At your service."

"Are you acquainted with the people who reside at a cottage--" and he described Marian's abode.

"Yes."

"Who are they?"

"Mr. Vosburgh has rented the place as a summer residence for his family. His wife and daughter
are there usually, and he comes when he can.

"And the daughter's name?"

"Miss Marian Vosburgh."

"Will you introduce me to her?"

"Certainly."

"I sha'n't be poaching on your grounds, shall I?"

"Miss Vosburgh honors me with her friendship,--nothing more."

"Is it so great an honor?"

"I esteem it as such."

"Who are they, anyway?"

"Well, as a family I regard them as my equals, and Miss Marian as my superior."

"Oh come, Strahan, gossip about them a little."

The officer burst out laughing. "Well," he said, "for a man of your phenomenal reticence you
are asking a good many questions."

Merwyn colored slightly and blundered: "You know my motive, Strahan; one does not care to make
acquaintances that are not quite--" and then the expression of his host's eyes checked him.

"I assure you the Vosburghs are 'QUITE,'" Strahan said, coldly. "Did I not say they were my
equals? You may esteem yourself fortunate if Miss Vosburgh ever permits you to feel yourself
to be her equal."

"Why, how so?" a little irritably.

"Because if a man has brains and discernment the more he sees of her the more will he be inclined
to doubt his equality."

Merwyn smiled in a rather superior way, and, with a light laugh, said: "I understand, Strahan.
A man in your plight ought to feel in that way; at least, it is natural that he should. Now
see here, old fellow, I'll keep aloof if you say so."

"Why should you? You have seen few society queens abroad who received so much and so varied
homage as Miss Vosburgh. There are half a dozen fellows there, more or less, every evening,
and you can take your chances among them."

"Oh, she's a bit of a coquette, then?"

"You must discover for yourself what she is," said the young man, buckling on his sword. "She
has my entire respect."

"You quite pique my curiosity. I'll drive in for you this evening."

At the hour appointed, Strahan, in civilian's dress, stepped into Merwyn's carriage and was
driven rapidly to the cottage. Throwing the reins to a footman, the young fellow followed the
officer with a confidence not altogether well founded, as he soon learned. Many guests were
present, and Lane was among them. When Merwyn was presented Marian was observed to bow merely
and not give her hand, as was her custom when a friend of hers introduced a friend. Some of
the residents in the vicinity exchanged significant smiles when they saw that the fastidious
and exclusive Willard Merwyn had joined their circle. Mrs. Vosburgh, who was helping to entertain
the guests, recognized nothing in his presence beyond a new social triumph for her daughter,
and was very gracious. To her offices, as hostess, he found himself chiefly relegated for a time.

This suited him exactly, since it gave him a chance for observation; and certainly the little
drawing-room, with its refined freedom, was a revelation to him. Conversation, repartee, and
jest were unrestrained. While Lane was as gay as any present, Merwyn was made to feel that
he was no ordinary man, and it soon came out in the natural flow of talk that he, too, was
in the service. Merwyn was introduced also to a captain of the regular army, and, whatever
be might think of these people, he instinctively felt that they would no more permit themselves
to be patronized than would the sons of noble houses abroad. Indeed, he was much too adroit
to attempt anything of the kind, and, with well-bred ease, made himself at home among them
in general conversation.

Meanwhile, he watched Marian with increasing curiosity. To him she was a new and very interesting
type. He had seen no such vivacity and freedom abroad, and his experience led him to misunderstand
her.  "She is of the genus American girl, middle class," he thought, "who, by her beauty and
the unconventionality of her drawing-room, has become a quasi-belle. None of these men would
think of marrying her, unless it is little Strahan, and he wouldn't five years hence. Yet she
is piquant and fascinating after her style, a word and a jest for each and all, and spoken
with a sort of good-comradeship, rather than with an if-you-please-sir air. I must admit, however,
that there is nothing loud in tone, word, or manner. She is as delicate and refined as her
own beauty, and, although this rather florid mamma is present as chaperon, the scene and the
actors are peculiarly American. Well, I owe Strahan a good turn. I can amuse myself with this
girl without scruple."

At last he found an opportunity to say, "We have met once before, I believe, Miss Vosburgh."

"Met? Where?"

"Where I was inclined to go to sleep, and you gave me such a charming frown that I awakened
immediately and took a long ramble."

"I saw a person stretched at lazy length under the trees yesterday. You know the horror ladies
have of intoxicated men on the road-side."

"Was that the impression I made? Thanks."

"The impression made was that we had better pass as quickly as possible."

"You made a very different impression. Thanks to Strahan I am here this evening in consequence,
and am delighted that I came."

"'Delighted' is a strong word, Mr. Merwyn. Now that we are speaking of impressions, mine is
that years have elapsed since you were greatly delighted at anything."

"What gives you such an impression?"

"Women can never account for their intuitions."

"Women? Do not use such an elderly word in regard to one appearing as if just entering girlhood."

"O Mr. Merwyn! have you not learned abroad that girls of my age are elderly indeed compared
with men of yours?"

He bit his lip. "English girls are not so--"

"Fast?"

"I didn't say that. They certainly have not the vivacity and fascination that I am discovering
in your drawing-room."

"Why, Mr. Merwyn! one would think you had come to America on a voyage of discovery, and were
surprised at the first thing you saw."

"I think I could show you things abroad that would interest you."

"All Europe could not tempt me to go abroad at this time. In your estimation I am not even
a woman,--only a girl, and yet I have enough girlhood to wish to take my little part in the
events of the day."

He colored, but asked, quietly, "What part are you taking?"

"Such questions," she replied, with a merry, half-mocking flash of her eyes, "I answer by deeds.
There are those who know;" and then, being addressed by Mr. Lane, she turned away, leaving
him with confused, but more decided sensations than he had known for a long time.

His first impulse was to leave the house, but this course would only subject him to ridicule
on the part of those who remained. After a moment or two of reflection he remembered that she
had not invited him, and that she had said nothing essentially rude. He had merely chosen to
occupy a position in regard to his country that differed radically from hers, and she had done
little more than define her position.

"She is a Northern, as mamma is a Southern fanatic, with the difference that she is a young,
effervescing creature, bubbling over with the excitement of the times," he thought. "That fellow
in uniform, and the society of men like Strahan and Lane, haye turned her head, and she has
not seen enough of life to comprehend a man of the world. What do I care for her, or any here?
Her briery talk should only amuse me. When she learns more about who I am and what I possess
she will be inclined to imitate her discreet mamma and think of the main chance; meanwhile
I escape a summer's dulness and ennui;" and so he philosophically continued his observations
and chatted with Mrs. Vosburgh and others until, with Strahan, he took his departure, receiving
from Marian a bow merely, while to Strahan she gave her hand cordially.

"You seem to be decidedly in Miss Vosburgh's good graces," said Merwyn, as they drove away.

"I told you she was my friend."

"Is it very difficult to become her friend?"

"Well, that depends. You should not find it difficult, since you are so greatly my superior."

"Oh, come, Strahan."

"Pardon me, I forgot I was to express only my own thoughts, not yours."

"You don't know my thoughts or circumstances. Come now, let us be good comrades. I will begin
by thanking you cordially for introducing me to a charming young girl. I am sure I put on no
airs this evening."

"They would not have been politic, Merwyn, and, for the life of me, I can see no reason for them."

"Very well. Therefore you didn't see any. How like old times we are!  We were always together,
yet always sparring a little."

"You must take us as we are in these times," said Strahan, with a light laugh, for he felt
it would jeopardize his scheme, or hope rather, if he were too brusque with his companion.
"You see it is hard for us to understand your cosmopolitan indifference. American feeling just
now is rather tense on both sides of the line, and if you will recognize the fact you will
understand us better."

"I think I am already aware of the fact. If Miss Vosburgh were of our sex you would soon have
another recruit."

"I'd soon have a superior officer, you mean."

"I fancy you are rather under her thumb already."

"It's a difficult position to attain, I assure you."

"How so?"

"I have observed that, towards a good many, Miss Vosburgh is quite your equal in indifference."

"I like her all the better for that fact."

"So do I."

"How is it that you are so favored?"

"No doubt it seems strange to you. Mere caprice on her part, probably."

"You misunderstand me. I would like to learn your tactics."

"Jove! I'd like to teach you. Come down to-morrow and I'll give you a musket."

"You are incorrigible, Strahan. Do you mean that her good-will can be won only at the point
of the bayonet?"

"No one coached me. Surely you have not so neglected your education abroad that you do not
know how to win a lady's favor."

"You are a neutral, indeed."

"I wouldn't aid my own brother in a case of this kind."

"You are right; in matters of this kind it is every one for himself. You offered to show me,
a stranger, some attention, you know."

"Yes, Merwyn, and I'll keep my word. I will give you just as good courtesy as I receive. The
formalities have been complied with and you are acquainted with Miss Vosburgh. You have exactly
the same vantage that I had at the start, and you certainly cannot wish for more. If you wish
for further introductions, count on me."

Merwyn parted from his plain-spoken companion, well content. Strahan's promise to return all
the courtesy he received left a variable standard in Merwyn's hands that he could employ according
to circumstances or inclination. He was satisfied that his neighbor, in accordance with a trait
very common to young men, cherished for Miss Vosburgh a chivalric and sentimental regard at
which he would smile when he became older. Merwyn, however, had a certain sense of honor, and
would not have attempted deliberately to supplant one to whom he felt that he owed loyalty.
His mind having been relieved of all scruples of this character, he looked forward complacently
to the prospect of winning--what? He did not trouble himself to define the kind of regard he
hoped to inspire. The immediate purpose to kill time, that must intervene before he could return
to England, was sufficient. There was promise of occupation, mild excitement, and an amusing
triumph, in becoming the foremost figure in Marian's drawing-room.

There is scarcely need to dwell upon the events of a few subsequent weeks and the gradual changes
that were taking place. Life with its small vicissitudes rarely results from deliberate action.
Circumstances, from day to day, color and shape it; yet beneath the rippling, changing surface
a great tide may be rising. Strahan was succeeding fairly well in his recruiting service, and,
making allowances for his previous history, was proving an efficient officer. Marian was a
loyal, steadfast friend, reprimanding with mirthful seriousness at times, and speaking earnest
and encouraging words at others. After all, the mercurial young fellow daily won her increased
respect and esteem. He had been promoted to a captaincy, and such was the response of the loyal
North, during that dreary summer of disaster and confused counsels, that his company was nearly
full, and he was daily expecting orders for departure. His drill ground had become the occasional
morning resort of his friends, and each day gave evidence of improved soldierly bearing in his men.

Merwyn thus far had characteristically carried out his plans to "kill time." Thoroughly convinced
of his comparative superiority, he had been good-naturedly tolerant of the slow recognition
accorded to it by Marian. Yet he believed he was making progress, and the fact that her favor
was hard to win was only the more incitement. If she had shown early and decided preference
his occupation would have been gone; for what could he have done in those initiatory weeks
of their acquaintance if her eyes and tones had said, "I am ready to take you and your wealth"?
The attitude she maintained, although little understood, awakened a kind of respect, while
the barriers she quietly interposed aroused a keener desire to surmount them. By hauteur and
reserve at times he had made those with whom he associated feel that his position in regard
to the civil conflict was his own affair. Even Marian avoided the subject when talking with
him, and her mother never thought of mentioning it. Indeed, that thrifty lady would have been
rather too encouraging had not her daughter taken pains to check such a spirit. At the same
time the young girl made it emphatically understood that discussion of the events of the war
should be just as free when he was present as when he was absent.

Yet in a certain sense he was making progress, in that he awakened anger on her part, rather
than indifference. If she was a new type to him so was he to her, and she found her thoughts
reverting to him in hostile analysis of his motives and character. She had received too much
sincere homage and devotion not to detect something cynical and hollow in his earlier attentions.
She had seen glances toward her mother, and had caught in his tones an estimate which, however
true, incensed her greatly. Her old traits began to assert themselves, and gradually her will
accorded with Strahan's hope. If, without compromising herself, she could humble this man,
bringing him to her feet and dismissing him with a rather scornful refusal, such an exertion
of power would give her much satisfaction. Yet her pride, as well as her principle, led her
to determine that he should sue without having received any misleading favor on her part.

Merwyn had never proposed to sue at all, except in the way of conventional gallantry. For his
own amusement he had resolved to become her most intimate and familiar friend, and then it
would be time to go abroad. If false hopes were raised it would not much matter; Strahan or
some one else would console her. He admitted that his progress was slow, and her reserve hard
to combat. She would neither drive nor sail with him unless she formed one of a party.  Still
in this respect he was on the same footing with her best friends. One thing did trouble him,
however; she had never given him her hand, either in greeting or in parting.

At last he brought about an explanation that disturbed his equanimity not a little. He had
called in the morning, and she had chatted charmingly with him on impersonal matters, pleasing
him by her intelligent and gracefully spoken ideas on the topics broached. As a society girl
she met him on this neutral ground without the slightest restraint or embarrassment. As he
also talked well she had no scruple in enjoying a pleasure unsought by herself, especially
as it might lead to the punishment which she felt that he deserved. Smilingly she had assured
herself, when he was announced, "If he's a rebel at heart, as I've been told, I've met the
enemy before either Mr. Lane or Mr. Strahan."

When Merwyn rose to take his leave he held out his hand and said: "I shall be absent two or
three days. In saying good-by won't you shake hands?"

She laughingly put her hands behind her back and said, "I can't."

"Will not, you mean?"

"No, I cannot. I've made a vow to give my hand only to my own friends and those of my country."

"Do you look upon me as an enemy?"

"Oh, no, indeed."

"Then not as a friend?"

"Why, certainly not, Mr. Merwyn. You know that you are not my friend. What does the word mean?"

"Well," said he, flushing, "what does it mean?"

"Nothing more to me than to any other sincere person. One uses downright sincerity with a friend,
and would rather harm himself than that friend."

"Why is not this my attitude towards you?"

"You, naturally, should know better than I."

"Indeed, Miss Vosburgh, you little know the admiration you have excited," he said, gallantly.

An inscrutable smile was her only response.

"That, however, has become like the air you breathe, no doubt."

"Not at all. I prize admiration. What woman does not? But there are as many kinds of admiration
as there are donors."

"Am I to infer that mine is of a valueless nature?"

"Ask yourself, Mr. Merwyn, just what it is worth."

"It is greater than I have ever bestowed upon any one else," he said, hastily; for this tilt
was disturbing his self-possession.

Again she smiled, and her thought was, "Except yourself."

He, thinking her smile incredulous, resumed: "You doubt this?"

"I cannot help thinking that you are mistaken."

"How can I assure you that I am not?"

"I do not know. Why is it essential that I should be so assured?"

He felt that he was being worsted, and feared that she had detected the absence of unselfish
good-will and honest purpose toward her. He was angry with himself and her because of the dilemma
in which he was placed. Yet what could he say to the serene, smiling girl before him, whose
unflinching blue eyes looked into his with a keenness of insight that troubled him? His one
thought now was to achieve a retreat in which he could maintain the semblance of dignity and
good breeding.

With a light and deferential laugh he said: "I am taught, unmistakably, Miss Vosburgh, that
my regard, whatever it may be, is of little consequence to you, and that it would be folly
for me to try to prove a thing that would not interest you if demonstrated. I feel, however,
that one question is due to us both,--Is my society a disagreeable intrusion?"

"If it had been, Mr. Merwyn, you would have been aware of the fact before this. I have enjoyed
your conversation this morning."

"I hope, then, that in the future I can make a more favorable impression, and that in time
you will give me your hand."

Her blue eyes never left his face as he spoke, and they grew dark with a meaning that perplexed
and troubled him. She merely bowed gravely and turned away.

Never had his complacency been so disturbed. He walked homeward with steps that grew more and
more rapid, keeping pace with his swift, perturbed thoughts. As he approached his residence
he yielded to an impulse; leaped a wall, and struck out for the mountains.

CHAPTER XIII.

A SIEGE BEGUN.

"EITHER she is seeking to enhance her value, or else she is not the girl I imagined her to
be at all," was Willard Merwyn's conclusion as he sat on a crag high upon the mountain's side.
"Whichever supposition is true, I might as well admit at once that she is the most fascinating
woman I ever met. She IS a woman, as she claims to be. I've seen too many mere girls not to
detect their transparent deceits and motives at once. I don't understand Marian Vosburgh; I
only half believe in her, but I intend to learn whether there is a girl in her station who
would unhesitatingly decline the wealth and position that I can offer. Not that I have decided
to offer these as yet, by any means, for I am in a position to marry wealth and rank abroad;
but this girl piques my curiosity, stirs my blood, and is giving wings to time. At this rate
the hour of our departure may come before I am ready for it. I was mistaken in one respect
the first evening I met her. Lane, as well as Strahan and others, would marry her if they could.
She might make her choice from almost any of those who seek her society, and she is not the
pretty little Bohemian that I imagined. Either none of them has ever touched her heart, or
else she knows her value and vantage, and she means to make the most of them. If she knew the
wealth and position I could give her immediately, would not these certainties bring a different
expression into her eyes? I am not an ogre, that she should shrink from me as the only incumbrance."

Could he have seen the girl's passion after he left her he would have understood her dark look
at their parting. Hastily seeking her own room she locked the door to hide the tears of anger
and humiliation that would come.

"Well," she cried, "I AM punished for trifling with others. Here is a man who seeks me in my
home for no other purpose than his own amusement and the gratification of his curiosity. He
could not deny it when brought squarely to the issue. He could not look me in the eyes and
say that he was my honest friend. He would flirt with me, if he could, to beguile his burdensome
leisure; but when I defined what some are to me, and more would be, if permitted, he found
no better refuge than gallantry and evasion. What can he mean? what can he hope except to see
me in his power, and ready to accept any terms he may choose to offer? O Arthur Strahan! your
wish now is wholly mine. May I have the chance of rejecting this man as I never dismissed one
before!"

It must not be supposed that Willard's frequent visits to the Vosburgh cottage had escaped
Mrs. Merwyn's vigilant solicitude, but her son spoke of them in such a way that she obtained
the correct impression that he was only amusing himself. Her chief hope was that her son would
remain free until the South had obtained the power it sought. Then an alliance with one of
the leading families in the Confederacy would accomplish as much as might have resulted from
active service during the struggle. She had not hesitated to express this hope to him.

He had smiled, and said: "One of the leading theories of the day is the survival of the fittest.
I am content to limit my theory to a survival. If I am alive and well when your great Southern
empire takes the lead among nations there will be a chance for the fulfilment of your dream.
If I have disappeared beneath Southern mud there won't be any chance. In my opinion, however,
I should have tenfold greater power with our Southern friends if I introduced to them an English
heiress."

His mother had sighed and thought: "It is strange that this calculating boy should be my son.
His father was self-controlled and resolute, but he never manifested such cold-blooded thought
of self, first and always."

She did not remember that the one lesson taught him from his very cradle had been that of self-pleasing.
She had carried out her imperious will where it had clashed with his, and had weakly compensated
him by indulgence in the trifles that make up a child's life. SHE had never been controlled
or made to yield to others in thoughtful consideration of their rights and feelings, and did
not know how to instil the lesson; therefore--so inconsistent is human nature--when she saw
him developing her own traits, she was troubled because his ambitions differed from her own.
Had his hopes and desires coincided with hers he would have been a model youth in her eyes,
although never entertaining a thought beyond personal and family advantage. Apparently there
was a wider distinction between them, for she was capable of suffering and sacrifice for the
South. The possibilities of his nature were as yet unrevealed.

His course and spirit, however, set her at rest in regard to his visits to Marian Vosburgh,
and she felt that there was scarcely the slightest danger that he would compromise himself
by serious attentions to the daughter of an obscure American official.

Willard returned from his brief absence, and was surprised at his eager anticipation of another
interview with Marian. He called the morning after his arrival, and learning that she had just
gone to witness a drill of Strahan's company, he followed, and arrived almost as soon as she
did at the ground set apart for military evolutions.

He was greeted by Marian in her old manner, and by Strahan in his off-hand way. The young officer
was at her side, and a number of ladies and gentlemen were present as spectators. Merwyn took
a camp-stool, sat a little apart, and nonchalantly lighted a cigar.

Suddenly there was a loud commotion in the guard-house, accompanied by oaths and the sound
of a struggle. Then a wild figure, armed with a knife, rushed toward Strahan, followed by a
sergeant and two or three privates. At a glance it was seen to be the form of a tall, powerful
soldier, half-crazed with liquor.

"--you!" exclaimed the man; "you ordered me to be tied up. I'll larn you that we ain't down
in Virginny yet!" and there was reckless murder in his bloodshot eyes.

Although at that moment unarmed, Strahan, without a second's hesitation, sprung at the man's
throat and sought to catch his uplifted hand, but could not reach it. The probabilities are
that the young officer's military career would have been ended in another second, had not Merwyn,
without removing his cigar from his mouth, caught the uplifted arm and held it as in a vise.

"Stand back, Strahan," he said, quietly; but the young fellow would not loosen his hold. Therefore
Merwyn, with his left hand upon the collar of the soldier, jerked him a yard away, and tripped
him up so that he fell upon his face. Twisting the fellow's hands across his back, Merwyn said
to the sergeant, "Now tie him at your leisure."

This was done almost instantly, and the foul mouth was also stopped by a gag.

Merwyn returned to his camp-stool, and coolly removed the cigar from his mouth as he glanced
towards Marian. Although white and agitated, she was speaking eager, complimentary, and at
the same time soothing words to Strahan, who, in accordance with his excitable nature, was
in a violent passion. She did not once glance towards the man who had probably saved her friend's
life, but Strahan came and shook hands with him cordially, saying: "It was handsomely and bravely
done, Merwyn. I appreciate the service. You ought to be an officer, for you could make a good
one,--a better one than I am, for you are as cool as a cucumber."

Others, also, would have congratulated Merwyn had not his manner repelled them, and in a few
moments the drill began. Long before it was over Marian rose and went towards her phaeton.
In a moment Merwyn was by her side.

"You are not very well, Miss Vosburgh," he said. "Let me drive you home."

She bowed her acquiescence, and he saw that she was pale and a little faint; but by a visible
effort she soon rallied, and talked on indifferent subjects.

At last she said, abruptly: "I am learning what war means. It would seem that there is almost
as much danger in enforcing discipline on such horrible men as in facing the enemy."

"Of course," said Merwyn, carelessly. "That is part of the risk."

"Well," she continued, emphatically, "I never saw a braver act than that of Mr. Strahan. He
was unarmed."

"I was also!" was the somewhat bitter reply, "and you did not even thank me by a look for saving
your friend from a bad wound to say the least."

"I beg your pardon, Mr. Merwyn, you were armed with a strength which made your act perfectly
safe. Mr. Strahan risked everything."

"How could he help risking everything? The infuriated beast was coming towards you as well
as him. Could he have run away? You are not just to me, or at least you are very partial"

"One can scarcely help being partial towards one's friends. I agree with you, however; Mr.
Strahan could not have taken any other course. Could you, with a friend in such peril?"

"Certainly not, with any one in such peril. Let us say no more about the trifle."

She was silent a moment, and then said, impetuously: "You shall not misunderstand me. I don't
know whether I am unjust or not. I do know that I was angered, and cannot help it. You may
as well know my thoughts. Why should Mr. Strahan and others expose themselves to such risks
and hardships while you look idly on, when you so easily prove yourself able to take a man's
part in the struggle? You may think, if you do not say it, that it is no affair of mine; but
with my father, whom I love better than life, ready at any moment to give his life for a cause,
I cannot patiently see utter indifference to that cause in one who seeks my society."

"I think your feelings are very natural, Miss Vosburgh, nor do I resent your censure. You are
surrounded by influences that lead you to think as you do. You can scarcely judge for me, however.
Be fair and just. I yield to you fully--I may add, patiently--the right to think, feel, and
act as you think best. Grant equal rights to me."

"Oh, certainly," she said, a little coldly; "each one must choose his own course for life."

"That must ever be true," he replied, "and it is well to remember that it is for life. The
present condition of affairs is temporary. It is the hour of excited impulses rather than of
cool judgment. Ambitious men on both sides are furthering their own purposes at the cost of
others."

"Is that your idea of the war, Mr. Merwyn?" she asked, looking searchingly into his face.

"It is indeed, and time will prove me right, you will discover."

"Since this is your view, I can scarcely wonder at your course," she said, so quietly that
he misunderstood her, and felt that she half conceded its reasonableness. Then she changed
the subject, nor did she revert to it in his society.

As August drew to its close, Marian's circle shared the feverish solicitude felt in General
Pope's Virginia campaign. Throughout the North there was a loyal response to the appeal for
men, and Strahan's company was nearly full. He expected at any hour the orders which would
unite the regiment at Washington.

One morning Mr. Lane came to say good-by. It was an impressive hour which he spent with Marian
when bidding her perhaps a final farewell. She was pale, and her attempts at mirthfulness were
forced and feeble. When he rose to take his leave she suddenly covered her face with her hand,
and burst into tears.

"Marian!" he exclaimed, eagerly, for the deep affection in his heart would assert itself at
times, and now her emotion seemed to warrant hope.

"Wait," she faltered. "Do not go just yet."

He took her unresisting hand and kissed it, while she stifled her sobs.

"Miss Marian," he began, "you know how wholly I am yours--"

"Please do not misunderstand me," she interrupted. "I scarcely know how I could feel differently
if I were parting with my twin brother.  You have been such a true, generous friend! Oh, I
am all unstrung.  Papa has been sent for from Washington, and we don't know when he'll return
or what service may be required of him. I only know that he is like you, and will take any
risk that duty seems to demand. I have so learned to lean upon you and trust you that if anything
happened--well, I felt that I could go to you as a brother. You are too generous to blame me
that I cannot feel in any other way. See, I am frank with you. Why should I not be when the
future is so uncertain? Is it a little thing that I should think of you first and feel that
I shall miss you most when I am so distraught with anxiety?"

"No, Miss Marian. To me it is a sacred thing. I want you to know that you have a brother's
hand and heart at your disposal."

"I believe you. Come," she added, rising and dashing away her tears, "I must be brave, as you
are. Promise me that you will take no risks beyond those required by duty, and that you will
write to me."

"Marian," he said, in a low, deep voice, "I shall ever try to do what, in your heart, you would
wish. You must also promise that if you are ever in trouble you will let me know."

"I promise."

He again kissed her hand, like a knight of the olden time.

At the last turn of the road from which he was visible she waved her handkerchief, then sought
her room and burst into a passion of tears.

"Oh," she sobbed, "as I now feel I could not refuse him anything. I may never see him again,
and he has been so kind and generous!"

The poor girl was indeed morbid from excitement and anxiety. Her pale face began to give evidence
of the strain which the times imposed on her in common with all those whose hearts had much
at stake in the conflict.

In vain her mother remonstrated with her, and told her that she was "meeting trouble half-way."
Once the sagacious lady had ventured to suggest that much uncertainty might be taken out of
the future by giving more encouragement to Mr. Merwyn. "I am told that he is almost a millionnaire
in his own right," she said.

"What is he in his own heart and soul?" had been the girl's indignant answer. "Don't speak
to me in that way again, mamma."

Meanwhile Merwyn was a close observer of all that was taking place, and was coming to what
he regarded as an heroic resolution. Except as circumstances evoked an outburst of passion,
he yielded to habit, and coolly kept his eye on the main chances of his life, and these meant
what he craved most.

Two influences had been at work upon his mind during the summer. One resulted from his independent
possession of large property. He had readily comprehended the hints thrown out by his lawyer
that, if he remained in New York, the times gave opportunity for a rapid increase in his property,
and the thought of achieving large wealth for himself, as his father had done before him, was
growing in attractiveness. His indolent nature began to respond to vital American life, and
he asked himself whether fortune-making in his own land did not promise more than fortune-seeking
among English heiresses; moreover, he saw that his mother's devotion to the South increased
daily, and that feeling at the North was running higher and becoming more and more sharply
defined. As a business man in New York his property would be safe beyond a doubt, but if he
were absent and affiliating with those known to be hostile to the North, dangerous complications
might arise.

Almost unconsciously to himself at first the second influence was gaining daily in power. As
he became convinced that Marian was not an ordinary girl, ready for a summer flirtation with
a wealthy stranger, he began to give her more serious thought, to study her character, and
acknowledge to himself her superiority. With every interview the spell of her fascination grew
stronger, until at last he reached the conclusion which he regarded as magnanimous indeed.
Waiving all questions of rank and wealth on his part he would become a downright suitor to
this fair countrywoman. It did not occur to him that he had arrived at his benign mood by asking
himself the question, "Why should I not please myself?" and by the oft-recurring thought: "If
I marry rank and wealth abroad the lady may eventually remind me of her condescension. If I
win great wealth here and lift this girl to my position she will ever be devoted and subservient
and I be my own master. I prefer to marry a girl that pleases me in her own personality, one
who has brains as well as beauty. When these military enthusiasts have disappeared below the
Southern horizon, and time hangs more heavily on her hands, she will find leisure and thought
for me. What is more, the very uncertainties of her position, with the advice of her prudent
mamma, will incline her to the ample provision for the future which I can furnish."

Thus did Willard Merwyn misunderstand the girl he sought, so strong are inherited and perverted
traits and lifelong mental habits. He knew how easily, with his birth and wealth, he could
arrange a match abroad with the high contracting powers. Mrs. Vosburgh had impressed him as
the chief potentate of her family, and not at all averse to his purpose. He had seen Mr. Vosburgh
but once, and the quiet, reticent man had appeared to be a second-rate power. He had also learned
that the property of the family was chiefly vested in the wife. Of course, if Mr. Vosburgh
had been in the city, Merwyn would have addressed him first, but he was absent and the time
of his return unknown.

The son knew his mother would be furious, but he had already discounted that opposition. He
regarded this Southern-born lady as a very unsafe guide in these troublous times. Indeed, he
cherished a practical kind of loyalty to her and his sisters.

"Only as I keep my head level," he said to himself, "are they safe. Mamma would identify herself
with the South to-day if she could, and with a woman's lack of foresight be helpless on the
morrow. Let her dream her dreams and nurse her prejudices. I am my father's son, and the responsible
head of the family; and I part with no solid advantage until I receive a better one. I shall
establish mamma and the girls comfortably in England, and then return to a city where I can
soon double my wealth and live a life independent of every one."

This prospect grew to be so attractive that he indulged, like Mr. Lanniere, in King Cophetua's
mood, and felt that one American girl was about to become distinguished indeed.

Watching his opportunity he called upon Mrs. Vosburgh while Marian was out of the way, formally
asking her, in her husband's absence, for permission to pay his addresses; and he made known
his financial resources and prospects with not a little complacent detail.

Mrs. Vosburgh was dignified and gracious, enlarged on her daughter's worth, hinted that she
might be a little difficult to win by reason of the attentions she had received and her peculiar
views, yet left, finally, the impression that so flattering proposals could not be slighted.

Merwyn went home with a sigh of relief. He would no longer approach Marian with doubtful and
ill-defined intentions, which he believed chiefly accounted for the clever girl's coldness
towards him.

CHAPTER XIV.

OMINOUS.

SUBORDINATE only to her father and two chief friends, in Marian's thoughts, was her enemy,
for as such she now regarded Willard Merwyn. She had felt his attentions to be humiliating
from the first. They had presented her former life, in which her own amusement and pleasure
had been her chief thought, in another and a very disagreeable light. These facts alone would
have been sufficient to awaken a vindictive feeling, for she was no saint. In addition, she
bitterly resented his indifference to a cause made so dear by her father's devotion and her
friends' brave self-sacrifice.  Whatever his motive might be, she felt that he was cold-blooded,
cowardly, or disloyal, and such courtesy as she showed him was due to little else than the
hope of inflicting upon him some degree of humiliation. She had seen too many manifestations
of honest interest and ardent love to credit him with any such emotion, and she had no scruples
in wounding his pride to the utmost.

Meanwhile events in the bloody drama of the war were culminating. The Union officers were thought
to have neither the wisdom to fight at the right time nor the discretion to retreat when fighting
was worse than useless. In consequence thousands of brave men were believed by many to have
died in vain once more on the ill-fated field of Bull Run.

One morning, the last of August, Strahan galloped to the Vosburgh cottage and said to Marian,
who met him at the door: "Orders have come. I have but a few minutes in which to say good-by.
Things have gone wrong in Virginia, and every available man is wanted in Washington."

His flushed face was almost as fair as her own, and gave him a boyish aspect in spite of his
military dress, but unhesitating resolution and courage beamed from his eyes.

"Oh, that I were a man!" Marian cried, "and you would have company. All those who are most
to me will soon be perilling their lives."

"Guess who has decided to go with me almost at the last moment."

"Mr. Blauvelt?"

"Yes; I told him that he was too high-toned to carry a musket, but he said he would rather
go as a private than as an officer. He wishes no responsibility, he says, and, beyond mere
routine duty, intends to give all his time and thoughts to art. I am satisfied that I have
you to thank for this recruit."

"Indeed, I have never asked him to take part in the war."

"No need of your asking any one in set terms. A man would have to be either a coward, or else
a rebel at heart, like Merwyn, to resist your influence. Indeed, I think it is all the stronger
because you do not use it openly and carelessly. Every one who comes here knows that your heart
is in the cause, and that you would have been almost a veteran by this time were you of our
sex. Others, besides Blauvelt, obtained the impulse in your presence which decided them. Indeed,
your drawing-room has been greatly thinned, and it almost looks as if few would be left to
haunt it except Merwyn."

"I do not think he will haunt it much longer, and I should prefer solitude to his society."

"Well," laughed Strahan, "I think you will have a chance to put one rebel to rout before I
do. I don't blame you, remembering your feeling, but Merwyn probably saved my life, and I gave
him my hand in a final truce. Friends we cannot be while he maintains his present cold reserve.
As you told me, he said he would have done as much for any one, and his manner since has chilled
any grateful regard on my part. Yet I am under deep obligations, and hereafter will never do
or say anything to his injury."

"Don't trouble yourself about Mr. Merwyn, Arthur. I have my own personal score to settle with
him. He has made a good foil for you and my other friends, and I have learned to appreciate
you the more.  YOU have won my entire esteem and respect, and have taught me how quickly a
noble, self-sacrificing purpose can develop manhood. O Arthur, Heaven grant that we may all
meet again! How proud I shall then be of my veteran friends! and of you most of all. You are
triumphing over yourself, and you have won the respect of every one in this community."

"If I ever become anything, or do anything, just enter half the credit in your little note-book,"
he said, flushing with pleasure.

"I shall not need a note-book to keep in mind anything that relates to you. Your courage has
made me a braver, truer girl. Arthur, please, you won't get reckless in camp? I want to think
of you always as I think of you now. When time hangs heavy on your hands, would it give you
any satisfaction to write to me?"

"Indeed it will," cried the young officer. "Let me make a suggestion. I will keep a rough journal
of what occurs and of the scenes we pass through, and Blauvelt will illustrate it. How should
you like that? It will do us both good, and will be the next best thing to running in of an
evening as we have done here."

Marian was more than pleased with the idea. When at last Strahan said farewell, he went away
with every manly impulse strengthened, and his heart warmed by the evidences of her genuine regard.

In the afternoon Blauvelt called, and, with Marian and her mother, drove to the station to
take part in an ovation to Captain Strahan and his company. The artist had affairs to arrange
in the city before enlisting, and proposed to enter the service at Washington.

The young officer bore up bravely, but when he left his mother and sisters in tears, his face
was stern with effort. Marian observed, however, that his last glance from the platform of
the cars rested upon herself. She returned home depressed and nervously excited, and there
found additional cause for solicitude in a letter from her father informing her of the great
disaster to Union arms which poor generalship had invited. This, as she then felt, would have
been bad enough, but in a few tender, closing words, he told her that they might not hear from
him in some time, as he had been ordered on a service that required secrecy and involved some
danger. Mrs. Vosburgh was profuse in her lamentations and protests against her husband's course,
but Marian went to her room and sobbed until almost exhausted.

Her nature, however, was too strong, positive, and unchastened to find relief in tears, or
to submit resignedly. Her heart was full of bitterness and revolt, and her partisanship was
becoming almost as intense as that of Mrs. Merwyn.

The afternoon closed with a dismal rain-storm, which added to her depression, while relieving
her from the fear of callers. "O dear!" she exclaimed, as she rose from the mere form of supper,
"I have both head-ache and heart-ache. I am going to try to get through the rest of this dismal
day in sleep."

"Marian, do, at least, sit an hour or two with me. Some one may come and divert your thoughts."

"No one can divert me to-night. It seems as if an age had passed since we came here in June."

"Your father knows how alone we are in the world, with no near relatives to call upon. I think
he owes his first duty to us."

"The men of the North, who are right, should be as ready to sacrifice everything as the men
of the South, who are wrong; and so also should Northern women. I am proud of the fact that
my father is employed and trusted by his government. The wrong rests with those who caused
the war."

"Every man can't go and should not go. The business of the country must be carried on just
the same, and rich business men are as important as soldiers. I only wish that, in our loneliness
and with the future so full of uncertainty, you would give sensible encouragement to one abundantly
able to give you wealth and the highest position."

"Mr. Merwyn?"

"Yes, Mr. Merwyn," continued her mother, with an emphasis somewhat irritable. "He is not an
old, worn-out millionnaire, like Mr. Lanniere. He is young, exceedingly handsome, so high-born
that he is received as an equal in the houses of the titled abroad. He has come to me like
an honorable man, and asked for the privilege of paying his addresses. He would have asked
your father had he been in town.  He was frank about his affairs, and has just received, in
his own name, a very large property, which he proposes to double by entering upon business
in New York."

"What does his mother think of his intentions toward me?" the young girl asked, so quietly,
that Mrs. Vosburgh was really encouraged.

"He says that he and his mother differ on many points, and will differ on this one, and that
is all he seemed inclined to say, except to remark significantly that he had attained his majority."

"It was he whom you meant, when you said that some one might come who would divert my thoughts?"

"I think he would have come, had it not been for the storm."

"Mamma, you have not given him any encouragement? You have not compromised yourself, or me?"

Mrs. Vosburgh bridled with the beginnings of resentment, and said, "Marian, you should know
me too well--"

"There, there, mamma, I was wrong to think of such a thing; I ask your pardon."

"I may have my sensible wishes and preferences," resumed the lady, complacently, "but I have
never yet acted the role of the anxious, angling mamma. I cannot help wishing, however, that
you would consider favorably an offer like this one, and I certainly could not treat Mr. Merwyn
otherwise than with courtesy."

"That was right and natural of you, mamma. You have no controversy with Mr. Merwyn; I have.
I hate and detest him. Well, since he may come, I shall dress and be prepared."

"O Marian! you are so quixotic!"

"Dear mamma, you are mistaken. Do not think me inconsiderate of you.  Some day I will prove
I am not by my marriage, if I marry;" and she went to her mother and kissed her tenderly.

Then by a sudden transition she drew herself up with the dark, inscrutable expression that
was becoming characteristic since deeper experiences had entered into her life, and said, firmly:--

"Should I do as you suggest, I should be false to those true friends who have gone to fight,
perhaps to die; false to my father; false to all that's good and true in my own soul. As to
my heart," she concluded, with a contemptuous shrug, "that has nothing to do with the affair.
Mamma, you must promise me one thing. I do not wish you to meet Mr. Merwyn to-night. Please
excuse yourself if he asks for you. I will see him."

"Mark my words, Marian, you will marry a poor man."

"Oh, I have no objection to millionnaires," replied the girl, with a short, unmirthful laugh,
"but they must begin their suit in a manner differing from that of two who have favored me;"
and she went to her room.

As Merwyn resembled his deceased parent, so Marian had inherited not a little of her father's
spirit and character. Until within the last few months her mother's influence had been predominant,
and the young girl had reflected the social conventionalities to which she was accustomed.
No new traits had since been created. Her increasing maturity had rendered her capable of revealing
qualities inherent in her nature, should circumstances evoke them. The flower, as it expands,
the plant as it grows, is apparently very different, yet the same. The stern, beautiful woman
who is arraying herself before her mirror, as a soldier assumes his arms and equipments, is
the same with the thoughtless, pleasure-loving girl whom we first met in her drawing-room in
June; but months of deep and almost tragic experience have called into activity latent forces
received from her father's soul,--his power of sustained action, of resolute purpose, of cherishing
high ideals, and of white, quiet anger.

Her toilet was scarcely completed when Willard Merwyn was announced.

CHAPTER XV.

SCORN.

IT is essential that we should go back several hours in our story. On the morning of the day
that witnessed the departure of Strahan and his company Merwyn's legal adviser had arrived
and had been closeted for several hours with his client. Mr. Bodoin was extremely conservative.
Even in youth he had scarcely known any leanings toward passion of any kind or what the world
regards as folly. His training had developed and intensified natural characteristics, and now
to preserve in security the property intrusted to his care through a stormy, unsettled period
had become his controlling motive. He looked upon the ups and downs of political men and measures
with what seemed to him a superior and philosophical indifference, and he was more than pleased
to find in Merwyn, the son of his old client, a spirit so in accord with his own ideas.

They had not been very long together on this fateful day before he remarked: "My dear young
friend, it is exceedingly gratifying to find that you are level-headed, like your father. He
was a man, Willard, whom you do well to imitate. He secured what he wanted and had his own
way, yet there was no nonsense about him. I was his intimate friend as well as legal adviser,
and I know, perhaps, more of his life than any one else. Your mother, to-day, is the handsomest
woman of her years I ever saw, but when she was of your age her beauty was startling, and she
had almost as many slaves among the first young men of the South as there were darkies on the
plantation, yet your father quietly bore her away from them all. What is more, he so managed
as to retain her respect and affection to the last, at the same time never yielding an inch
in his just rights or dignity, and he ever made Mrs. Merwyn feel that her just rights and dignity
were equally sacred. Proud as your mother was, she had the sense to see that his course was
the only proper one. Their marriage, my boy, always reminded me of an alliance between two
sovereign and alien powers. It was like a court love-match abroad. Your father, a Northern
man, saw the beautiful Southern heiress, and he sued as if he were a potentate from a foreign
realm. Well-born and accustomed to wealth all his life, he matched her pride with a pride as
great, and made his offer on his feet as if he were conferring as much as he should receive.
That, in fact, was the only way to win a woman who had been bowed down to all her life.  After
marriage they lived together like two independent sovereigns, sometimes here, then in the city
house, and, when Mrs. Merwyn so desired it, on the Southern plantation, or abroad. He always
treated her as if she were a countess or a queen in her own right and paid the utmost deference
to her Southern ideas, but never for a moment permitted her to forget that he was her equal
and had the same right to his Northern views. In regard to financial matters he looked after
her interests as if he were her prime minister, instead of a husband wishing to avail himself
of anything. In his own affairs he consulted me constantly and together we planted his investments
on the bed-rock. These reminiscences will enable you to understand the pleasure with which
I recognize in you the same traits. Of course you know that the law gives you great power over
your property. If you were inclined to dissipation, or, what would be little better in these
times, were hot-headed and bent on taking part in this losing fight of the South, I should
have no end of trouble."

"You, also, are satisfied, then, that it will be a losing fight?" Merwyn had remarked.

"Yes, even though the South achieves its independence. I am off at one side of all the turmoil,
and my only aim is to keep my trusts safe, no matter who wins. I see things as they are up
to date and not as I might wish them to be if under the influence of passion or prejudice.
The South may be recognized by foreign powers and become a separate state, although I regard
this as very doubtful. In any event the great North and West, with the immense tides of immigration
pouring in, will so preponderate as to be overshadowing. The Southern empire, of which Mrs.
Merwyn dreams, would dwindle rather than grow. Human slavery, right or wrong, is contrary to
the spirit of the age. But enough of this political discussion. I only touch upon it to influence
your action. By the course you are pursuing you not only preserve all your Northern property,
but you will also enable me to retain for your mother and sisters the Southern plantation.
This would be impossible if you were seeking 'the bubble, reputation, at the cannon's mouth'
on either side. Whatever happens, there must still be law and government. Both sides will soon
get tired of this exhausting struggle, and then those who survive and have been wise will reap
the advantage. Now, as to your own affairs, the legal formalities are nearly completed. If
you return and spend the winter in New York I can put you in the way of vastly increasing your
property, and by such presence and business activity you will disarm all criticism which your
mother's Southern relations may occasion."

"Mamma will bitterly oppose my return."

"I can only say that what I advise will greatly tend to conserve Mrs. Merwyn's interests. If
you prefer, we can manage it in this way: after you have safely established your mother and
sisters abroad I can write you a letter saying that your interests require your presence."

And so it had been arranged, and the old lawyer sat down to dinner with Mrs. Merwyn, paying
her the courtly deference which, while it gratified her pride, was accepted as a matter of
course--as a part of her husband's legacy. He had soon afterwards taken his departure, leaving
his young client in a most complacent and satisfactory mood.

It may thus be seen that Merwyn was not an unnatural product of the influences which had until
now guided his life and formed his character. The reminiscences of his father's friend had
greatly increased his sense of magnanimity in his intentions towards Marian.  In the overweening
pride of youth he felt as if he were almost regally born and royally endowed, and that a career
was opening before him in which he should prove his lofty superiority to those whose heads
were turned by the hurly-burly of the hour. Young as he was, he had the sense to be in accord
with wise old age, that looked beyond the clouds and storm in which so many would be wrecked.
Nay, even more, from those very wrecks he would gather wealth.

"The time and opportunity for cool heads," he smilingly assured himself, "is when men are parting
with judgment and reason."

Such was his spirit when he sought the presence of the girl whose soul was keyed up to almost
a passion of self-sacrifice. His mind belittled the cause for which her idolized father was,
at that moment, perilling his life, and to which her dearest friends had consecrated themselves.
He was serene in congratulating himself that "little Strahan" had gone, and that the storm
would prevent the presence of other interlopers.

Although the room was lighted as usual, he had not waited many moments before a slight chill
fell upon his sanguine mood. The house was so still, and the rain dripped and the wind sighed
so dismally without, that a vague presentiment of evil began to assert itself. Heretofore he
had found the apartment full of life and mirth, and he could not help remembering that some
who had been its guests might now be out in the storm. Would she think of this also?

The parlor was scarcely in its usual pretty order, and no flowers graced the table. Evidently
no one was expected. "All the better," he assured himself; "and her desolation will probably
incline her the more to listen to one who can bring golden gleams on such a dreary night."

A daily paper, with heavy headlines, lay on a chair near him. The burden of these lines was
DEFEAT, CARNAGE, DEATH.

They increased the slight chill that was growing upon him, and made him feel that possibly
the story of his birth and greatness which he had hoped to tell might be swallowed up by this
other story which fascinated him with its horror.

A slight rustle caused him to look up, and Marian stood before him. Throwing aside the paper
as if it were an evil spell, he rose, would have offered his hand had there been encouragement,
but the girl merely bowed and seated herself as she said: "Good-evening, Mr.  Merwyn. You are
brave to venture out in such a storm."

Was there irony in the slight accent on the word "brave"? How singularly severe was her costume,
also!--simple black, without an ornament. Yet he admitted that he had never seen her in so
effective a dress, revealing, as it did, the ivory whiteness of her arms and neck.

"There is only one reason why I should not come this evening,--you may have hoped to escape
all callers."

"It matters little what one hopes in these times," she said, "for events are taking place which
set aside all hopes and expectations."

In her bitter mood she was impatient to have the interview over, so that she accomplished her
purpose. Therefore she proposed, contrary to her custom with him, to employ the national tragedy,
to which he was so indifferent, as one of her keenest weapons.

"It is quite natural that you should feel so, Miss Vosburgh, in regard to such hopes as you
have thus far entertained--"

"Since they are the only hopes I know anything about, Mr. Merwyn, I am not indifferent to them.
I suppose you were at the depot to see your friend, Mr. Strahan, depart?" and the question
was asked with a steady, searching scrutiny that was a little embarrassing.

Indeed, her whole aspect produced a perplexed, wondering admiration, for she seemed breathing
marble in her cold self-possession. He felt, however, that the explanation which he must give
of his absence when so many were evincing patriotic good-will would enable him to impress her
with the fact that he had superior interests at stake in which she might have a share.

Therefore he said, gravely, as if the reason were ample: "I should have been at the depot,
of course, had not my legal adviser come up from town to-day and occupied me with very important
business. Mr.  Bodoin's time is valuable to him, and he presented, for my consideration, questions
of vital interest. I have reached that age now when I must not only act for myself, but I also
have very delicate duties to perform towards my mother and sisters."

"Mr. Strahan had a sad duty to perform towards his mother and sisters,--he said good-by to them."

"A duty which I shall soon have to perform, also," Merwyn said.

She looked at him inquiringly. Had he at last found his manhood, and did he intend to assert
it? Had he abandoned his calculating policy, and was he cherishing some loyal purpose? If this
were true and she had any part in his decision, it would be a triumph indeed; and, while she
felt that she could never respond to any such proposition as he had made through her mother,
she could forget the past and give him her hand in friendly encouragement towards such a career
as Lane and Strahan had chosen. She felt that it would be well not to be over-hasty in showing
resentment, but if possible to let him reveal his plans and character fully. She listened quietly,
therefore, without show of approval or disapproval, as he began in reply to her questioning glance.

"I am going to be frank with you this evening, Miss Vosburgh. The time has come when I should
be so. Has not Mrs. Vosburgh told you something of the nature of my interview with her?"

The young girl merely bowed.

"Then you know how sincere and earnest I am in what--in what I shall have to say."

To his surprise he felt a nervous trepidation that he would not have imagined possible in making
his magnanimous offer. He found this humble American girl more difficult to approach than any
other woman he had ever met.

"Miss Vosburgh," he continued, hesitatingly, "when I first entered this room I did not understand
your true worth and superiority, but a sense of these has been growing on me from that hour
to this. Perhaps I was not as sincere as I--I--should have been, and you were too clever not
to know it. Will you listen to me patiently?"

Again she bowed, and lower this time to conceal a slight smile of triumph.

Encouraged, he proceeded: "Now that I have learned to know you well, I wish you to know me
better,--to know all about me. My father was a Northern man with strong Northern traits; my
mother, a Southern woman with equally strong Southern traits. I have been educated chiefly
abroad. Is it strange, then, that I cannot feel exactly as you do, or as some of your friends do?"

"As we once agreed, Mr. Merwyn, each must choose his own course for life."

"I am glad you have reminded me of that, for I am choosing for life and not for the next ten
months or ten years. As I said, then, all this present hurly-burly will soon pass away." Her
face darkened, but in his embarrassment and preoccupation he did not perceive it. "I have inherited
a very large property, and my mother's affairs are such that I must act wisely, if not always
as she would wish."

"May I ask what Mrs. Merwyn would prefer?"

"I am prepared to be perfectly frank about myself," he replied, hesitatingly, "but--"

"Pardon me. It is immaterial."

"I have a perfect right to judge and act for myself," resumed Merwyn, with some emphasis.

"Thank you. I should remember that."

The words were spoken in a low tone and almost as if in soliloquy, and her face seemed to grow
colder and more impassive if possible.

With something approaching dismay Merwyn had observed that the announcement of his large fortune
had had no softening influence on the girl's manner, and he thought, "Truly, this is the most
dreary and business-like wooing that I ever imagined!"

But he had gone too far to recede, and his embarrassment was beginning to pass into something
like indignation that he and all he could offer were so little appreciated.

Restraining this feeling, he went on, gravely and gently: "You once intimated that I was young,
Miss Vosburgh, yet the circumstances and responsibilities of my lot have led me to think more,
perhaps, than others of my age, and to look beyond the present hour. I regard the property
left me by my father as a trust, and I have learned to-day that I can greatly increase and
probably double it. It is my intention, after taking my mother and sisters abroad, to return
to New York and to enter cautiously into business under the guidance of my legal adviser, who
is a man of great sagacity. Now, as you know, I have said from the first that it is natural
for you to feel deeply in regard to the events of the day; but I look beyond all this turmoil,
distraction, and passion, which will be as temporary as it is violent. I am thinking for you
as truly as for myself. Pardon me for saying it; I am sure I am in a better condition of mind
to think for you than you are to judge for yourself. I can give you the highest social position,
and make your future a certainty. From causes I can well understand the passion of the hour
has been swaying you--"

She rose, and by an emphatic gesture stopped him, and there was a fire in the blue eyes that
had been so cold before. She appeared to have grown inches as she stood before him and said,
in tones of concentrated scorn: "You are indeed young, yet you speak the calculating words
of one so old as to have lost every impulse of youth. Do you know where my father is at this
moment?"

"No," he faltered.

"He is taking part, at the risk of his life, in this temporary hurly-burly, as you caricature
it. It is he who is swaying me, and the memory of the brave men whom you have met here and
to whom you fancied yourself superior. Did not that honored father exist, or those brave friends,
I feel within my soul that I have womanhood enough to recognize and feel my country's need
in this supreme hour of her peril. You thoughtful beyond your years?--you think for me? What
did you think of me the first evening you spent here? What were your thoughts as you came again
and again? To what am I indebted for this honor, but the fact that you could only beguile a
summer's ennui by a passing flirtation which would leave me you little cared where, after you
had joined your aristocratic friends abroad? Now your plans have changed, and, after much deliberation,
you have come to lift me to the highest position! Never dream that I can descend to your position!"

He was fairly trembling with anger and mortification, and she was about to leave the apartment.

"Stay!" he said, passing his hand across his brow as if to brush away confusion of mind; "I
have not given you reason for such contempt, and it is most unreasonable."

"Why is it unreasonable?" she asked, her scornful self-control passing into something like
passion. "I will speak no more of the insult of your earlier motives towards me, now that you
think you can afford to marry me. In your young egotism you may think a girl forgets and forgives
such a thing easily if bribed by a fortune. I will let all that be as if it were not, and meet
you on the ground of what is, at this present hour. I despise you because you have no more
mind or manhood--take it as you will--than to think that this struggle for national life and
liberty is a mere passing fracas of politicians. Do you think I will tamely permit you to call
my noble father little better than a fool? He has explained to me what this war means--he,
of twice your age, and with a mind as large as his manhood and courage. You have assumed to
be his superior, also, as well as that of Mr. Lane and Mr. Strahan, who are about to peril
life in the 'hurly-burly.' What are your paltry thousands to me?  Should I ever love, I will
love a MAN; and had I your sex and half your inches, I should this hour be in Virginia, instead
of defending those I love and honor against your implied aspersions. Had you your mother's
sentiments I should at least respect you, although she has no right to be here enjoying the
protection of a government that she would destroy."

He was as pale as she had become flushed, and again he passed his hand over his brow confusedly
and almost helplessly. "It is all like a horrid dream," he muttered.

"Mr. Merwyn, you have brought this on yourself," she said, more calmly. "You have sought to
wrong me in my own home. Your words and manner have ever been an insult to the cause for which
my father may die--O God!" she exclaimed, with a cry of agony--"for which he may now be dead!
Go, go," she added, with a strong repellent gesture.  "We have nothing in common: you measure
everything with the inch-rule of self."

As if pierced to the very soul he sprung forward and seized her hand with almost crushing force,
as he cried: "No, I measure everything hereafter by the breadth of your woman's soul. You shall
not cast me off in contempt. If you do you are not a woman,--you are a fanatic, worse than
my mother;" and he rushed from the house like one distraught.

Panting, trembling, frightened by a volcanic outburst such as she had never dreamed of, Marian
sunk on a lounge, sobbing like a child.

CHAPTER XVI.

AWAKENED AT LAST.

IT may well be imagined that Mrs. Vosburgh was not far distant during the momentous interview
described in the last chapter, and, as Merwyn rushed from the house as if pursued by the furies,
she appeared at once on the scene, full of curiosity and dismay.

Exclamations, questionings, elicited little from Marian. The strain of the long, eventful day
had been too great, and the young girl, who might have been taken as a type of incensed womanhood
a few moments before, now had scarcely better resources than such remedies as Mrs. Vosburgh's
matronly experience knew how to apply. Few remain long on mountain-tops, physical or metaphorical,
and deep valleys lie all around them. Little else could be done for the poor girl than to bring
the oblivion of sleep, and let kindly Nature nurse her child back to a more healthful condition
of body and mind.

But it would be long before Willard Merwyn would be amenable to the gentle offices of nature.
Simpson, the footman, flirting desperately with the pretty waitress in the kitchen below, heard
his master's swift, heavy step on the veranda, and hastened out only in time to clamber into
his seat as Merwyn drove furiously away in the rain and darkness. Every moment the trembling
lackey expected they would all go to-wreck and ruin, but the sagacious animals were given their
heads, and speedily made their way home.

The man took the reeking steeds to the stable, and Merwyn disappeared. He did not enter the
house, for he felt that he would stifle there, and the thought of meeting his mother was intolerable.
Therefore, he stole away to a secluded avenue, and strode back and forth under the dripping
trees, oblivious, in his fierce perturbation, of outward discomfort.

Mrs. Merwyn waited in vain for him to enter, then questioned the attendant.

"Faix, mum, I know nothin' at all. Mr. Willard druv home loike one possessed, and got out at
the door, and that's the last oi've seen uv 'im."

The lady received the significant tidings with mingled anxiety and satisfaction. Two things
were evident. He had become more interested in Miss Vosburgh than he had admitted, and she,
by strange good fortune, had refused him.

"It was a piece of folly that had to come in some form, I suppose," she soliloquized, "although
I did not think Willard anything like so sure to perpetrate it as most young men. Well, the
girl has saved me not a little trouble, for, of course, I should have been compelled to break
the thing up;" and she sat down to watch and wait. She waited so long that anxiety decidedly
got the better of her satisfaction.

Meanwhile the object of her thoughts was passing through an experience of which he had never
dreamed. In one brief hour his complacency, pride, and philosophy of life had been torn to
tatters.  He saw himself as Marian saw him, and he groaned aloud in his loathing and humiliation.
He looked back upon his superior airs as ridiculous, and now felt that he would rather be a
private in Strahan's company than the scorned and rejected wretch that he was.  The passionate
nature inherited from his mother was stirred to its depths. Even the traits which he believed
to be derived from his father, and which the calculating lawyer had commended, had secured
the young girl's most withering contempt; and he saw how she contrasted him with her father
and Mr. Lane,--yes, even with little Strahan. In her bitter words he heard the verdict of the
young men with whom he had associated, and of the community. Throughout the summer he had dwelt
apart, wrapped in his own self-sufficiency and fancied superiority. His views had been of gradual
growth, and he had come to regard them as infallible, especially when stamped with the approval
of his father's old friend; but the scathing words, yet ringing in his ears, showed him that
brave, conscientious manhood was infinitely more than his wealth and birth. As if by a revelation
from heaven he saw that he had been measuring everything with the little rule of self, and
in consequence he had become so mean and small that a generous-hearted girl had shrunk from
him in loathing.

Then in bitter anger and resentment he remembered how he was trammelled by his oath to his
mother. It seemed to him that his life was blighted by this pledge and a false education. There
was no path to her side who would love and honor only a MAN.

At last the mere physical manifestations of passion and excitement began to pass away, and
he felt that he was acting almost like one insane as he entered the house.

Mrs. Merwyn met him, but he said, hoarsely, "I cannot talk with you to-night."

"Willard, be rational. You are wet through. You will catch your death in these clothes."

"Nothing would suit me better, as I feel now;" and he broke away.

He was so haggard when he came down late the next morning that his mother could not have believed
such a change possible in so short a time. "It is going to be more serious than I thought,"
was her mental comment as she poured him out a cup of coffee.

It was indeed; for after drinking the coffee in silence, he looked frowningly out of the window
for a time; then said abruptly to the waiter, "Leave the room."

The tone was so stern that the man stole out with a scared look.

"Willard," began Mrs. Merwyn, with great dignity, "you are acting in a manner unbecoming your
birth and breeding."

Turning from the window, he fixed his eyes on his mother with a look that made her shiver.

At last he asked, in a low, stern voice, "Why did you bind me with that oath?"

"Because I foresaw some unutterable folly such as you are now manifesting."

"No," he said, in the same cold, hard tone. "It was because your cursed Confederacy was more
to you than my freedom, than my manhood,--more to you than I am myself."

"O Willard! What ravings!"

"Was my father insane when he quietly insisted on his rights, yielding you yours? What right
had you to cripple my life?"

"I took the only effective means to prevent you from doing just that for yourself."

"How have you succeeded?"

"I have prevented you, as a man of honor, from doing, under a gust of passion, what would spoil
all my plans and hopes."

"I am not a man. You have done your best to prevent me from being one. You have bound me with
a chain, and made me like one of the slaves on your plantation. Your plans and hopes? Have
I no right to plans and hopes?"

"You know my first thought has been of you and for you."

"No, I do not know this. I now remember that, when you bound me, a thoughtless, selfish, indolent
boy, you said that you would have torn your heart out rather than marry my father had you foreseen
what was coming. This miserable egotist, Jeff Davis, and his scheme of empire, cost what it
may, are more to you than husband or child. A mother would have said: 'You have reached manhood
and have the rights of a man. I will advise you and seek to guide you. You know my feelings
and views, and in their behalf I will even entreat you; but you have reached that age when
the law makes you free, and holds you accountable to your own conscience.' Of what value is
my life if it is not mine? I should have the right to make my own life, like others."

"You have the right to make it, but not to mar it."

"In other words, your prejudices, your fanaticism, are to take the place of my conscience and
reason. You expect me to carry a sham of manhood out into the world. I wish you to release
me from my oath."

"Never," cried Mrs. Merwyn, with a passion now equal to his own. "You have fallen into the
hands of a Delilah, and she has shorn you of your manhood. Infatuated with a nameless Northern
girl, you would blight your life and mine. When you come to your senses you will thank me on
your knees that I interposed an oath that cannot be broken between you and suicidal folly;"
and she was about to leave the room.

"Stop," he said, huskily. "When I bound myself I did so without realizing what I did. I was
but a boy, knowing not the future. I did it out of mere good-will to you, little dreaming of
the fetters you were forging. Since you will not release me and treat me as a man I shall keep
the oath. I swore never to put on the uniform of a Union soldier, or to step on Southern soil
with a hostile purpose, but you have taught me to detest your Confederacy with implacable hate;
and I shall use my means, my influence, all that I am, to aid others to destroy it."

"What! are you not going back to England with us?"

"Yes."

"Before you have been there a week this insane mood will pass away."

"Did my father's moods pass away?"

"Your father--" began the lady, impetuously, and then hesitated.

"My father always yielded you your just rights and maintained his own. I shall imitate his
example as far as I now may. The oath is a thing that stands by itself. It will probably spoil
my life, but I cannot release myself from it."

"You leave me only one course, Willard,--to bear with you as if you were a passionate child.
You never need hope for my consent to an alliance with the under-bred creature who has been
the cause of this folly."

"Thank you. You now give me your complete idea of my manhood. I request that these subjects
be dismissed finally between us. I make another pledge,--I shall be silent whenever you broach
them;" and with a bow he left the apartment.

Half an hour later he was climbing the nearest mountain, resolved on a few hours of solitude.
From a lofty height he could see the little Vosburgh cottage, and, by the aid of a powerful
glass, observed that the pony phaeton did not go out as usual, although the day was warm and
beautiful after the storm.

The mists of passion were passing from his mind, and in strong reaction from his violent excitement
he sunk, at first, into deep depression. So morbid was he that he cried aloud: "O my father!
Would to God that you had lived! Where are you that you can give no counsel, no help?"

But he was too young to give way to utter despondency, and at last his mind rallied around
the words he had spoken to Marian. "I shall, hereafter, measure everything by the breadth of
your woman's soul."

As he reviewed the events of the summer in the light of recent experience, he saw how strong,
unique, and noble her character was. Faults she might have in plenty, but she was above meannesses
and mercenary calculation. The men who had sought her society had been incited to manly action,
and beneath all the light talk and badinage earnest and heroic purposes had been formed; he
meanwhile, poor fool! had been too blinded by conceited arrogance to understand what was taking
place. He had so misunderstood her as to imagine that after she had spent a summer in giving
heroic impulses she would be ready to form an alliance that would stultify all her action,
and lose her the esteem of men who were proving their regard in the most costly way. He wondered
at himself, but thought:--

"I had heard so much about financial marriages abroad that I had gained the impression that
no girl in these days would slight an offer like mine. Even her own mother was ready enough
to meet my views. I wonder if she will ever forgive me, ever receive me again as a guest, so
that I can make a different impression. I fear she will always think me a coward, hampered
as I am by a restraint that I cannot break. Well, my only chance is to take up life from her
point of view, and to do the best I can. There is something in my nature which forbids my ever
yielding or giving up. So far as it is now possible I shall keep my word to her, and if she
has a woman's heart she may, in time, so far relent as to give me a place among her friends.
This is now my ambition, for, if I achieve this, I shall know I am winning such manhood as
I can attain."

When Merwyn appeared at dinner he was as quiet and courteous as if nothing had happened; but
his mother was compelled to note that the boyishness had departed out of his face, and in its
strong lines she recognized his growing resemblance to his father.

Two weeks later he accompanied his mother and sisters to England. Before his departure he learned
that Marian had been seriously ill, but was convalescent, and that her father had returned.

Meantime and during the voyage, with the differences natural to the relation of mother and
son, his manner was so like that of his father towards her that she was continually reminded
of the past, and was almost led to fear that she had made a grave error in the act she had
deemed so essential. But her pride and her hopes for the future prevented all concession.

"When he is once more in society abroad this freak will pass away," she thought, "and some
English beauty will console him."

But after they were well established in a pretty villa near congenial acquaintances, Merwyn
said one morning, "I shall return to New York next week."

"Willard! how can you think of such a thing? I was planning to spend the latter part of the
winter in Rome."

"That you may easily do with your knowledge of the city and your wide circle of friends."

"But we need you. We want you to be with us, and I think it most unnatural in you to leave
us alone."

"I have taken no oath to dawdle around Europe indefinitely. I propose to return to New York
and go into business."

"You have enough and more than enough already."

"I certainly have had enough of idleness."

"But I protest against it. I cannot consent."

"Mamma," he said, in the tone she so well remembered, "is not my life even partially my own?
What is your idea of a man whom both law and custom make his own master? Even as a woman you
chose for yourself at the proper age. What strange infatuation do you cherish that you can
imagine that a son of Willard Merwyn has no life of his own to live? It is now just as impossible
for me to idle away my best years in a foreign land as it would be for me to return to my cradle.
I shall look after your interests and comfort to the best of my ability, and, if you decide
to return to New York, you shall be received with every courtesy."

"I shall never return to New York. I would much prefer to go to my plantation and share the
fortunes of my own people."

"I supposed you would feel in that way, and I will do all in my power to further your wishes,
whatever they may be. My wishes, in personal matters, are now equally entitled to respect.
I shall carry them out;" and with a bow that precluded all further remonstrance he left the room.

A day or two later she asked, abruptly, "Will you use your means and influence against the South?"

"Yes."

Mrs. Merwyn's face became rigid, but nothing more was said. When he bade her good-by there
was an evident struggle in her heart, but she repressed all manifestations of feeling, and
mother and son parted.

CHAPTER XVII.

COMING TO THE POINT.

WHEN the tide has long been rising the time comes for it to recede. From the moment of Marian's
awakening to a desire for a better womanhood, she had been under a certain degree of mental
excitement and exaltation. This condition had culminated with the events that wrought up the
loyal North into suspense, anguish, and stern, relentless purpose.

While these events had a national and world-wide significance, they also pressed closely, in
their consequences, on individual life. It has been shown how true this was in the experience
of Marian. Her own personal struggle alone, in which she was combating the habits and weakness
of the past, would not have been a trivial matter,--it never is when there is earnest endeavor,--but,
in addition to this, her whole soul had been kindling in sympathy with the patriotic fire that
was impelling her dearest friends towards danger and possible death. Lane's, Strahan's, and
Blauvelt's departure, and her father's peril, had brought her to a point that almost touched
the limit of endurance. Then had come the man whose attentions had been so humiliating to her
personally, and who represented to her the genius of the Rebellion that was bringing her such
cruel experience. She saw his spirit of condescension even in his offer of marriage; worse
still, she saw that he belittled the conflict in which even her father was risking his life;
and her indignation and resentment had burst forth upon him with a power that she could not
restrain.

The result had been most unexpected. Instead of slinking away overwhelmed with shame and confusion,
or departing in haughty anger, Merwyn had revealed to her that which is rarely witnessed by
any one,--the awakening of a strong, passionate nature. In the cynical, polished, self-pleasing
youth was something of which she had not dreamed,--of which he was equally unaware. Her bitter
words pierced through the strata of self-sufficiency and pride that had been accumulating for
years. She stabbed with truth the outer man and slew it, but the inner and possible manhood
felt the sharp thrust and sprung up wounded, bleeding, and half desperate with pain. That which
wise and kindly education might have developed was evoked in sudden agony, strong yet helpless,
overwhelmed with the humiliating consciousness of what had been, and seeing not the way to
what she would honor. Yet in that supreme moment the instinct asserted itself that she, who
had slain his meaner self, had alone the power to impart the impulse toward true manhood and
to give the true measure of it. Hence a declaration so passionate, and an appeal so full of
his immense desire and need, that she was frightened, and faltered helplessly.

In the following weary days of suffering and weakness, she realized that she was very human,
and not at all the exalted heroine that she had unconsciously come to regard herself. The suitor
whom she had thought to dismiss in contempt and anger, and to have done with, could not be
banished from her mind. The fact that he had proved himself to be all that she had thought
him did not satisfy her, for the reason that he had apparently shown himself to be so much
more.  She had judged him superficially, and punished him accordingly. She had condemned him
unsparingly for traits which, except for a few short months, had been her own characteristics.
While it was true that they seemed more unworthy in a man, still they were essentially the same.

"But he was not a man," she sighed. "He was scarcely more than the selfish boy that wealth,
indulgence, and fashionable life had made him. Why was I so blind to this? Why could I not
have seen that nothing had ever touched him deeply enough to show what he was, or, at least,
of what he was capable? What was Strahan before his manhood was awakened? A little gossiping
exquisite. Even Mr. Lane, who was always better than any of us, has changed wonderfully since
he has had exceptional motives for noble action. What was I, myself, last June, when I was
amusing myself at the expense of a man whom I knew to be so good and true? In view of all this,
instead of having a little charity for Mr. Merwyn, who, no doubt, is only the natural product
of the influences of his life, I only tolerated him in the vindictive hope of giving the worst
blow that a woman can inflict. I might have seen that he had a deeper nature; at least, I might
have hoped that he had, and given him a chance to reveal it. Perhaps there has never been one
who tried to help him toward true manhood.  He virtually said that his mother was a Southern
fanatic, and his associations have been with those abroad who sympathized with her.  Is it
strange that a mere boy of twenty-one should be greatly influenced by his mother and her aristocratic
friends? He said his father was a Northern man, and he may have imbibed the notion that he
could not fight on either side. Well, if he will give up such a false idea, if he will show
that he is not cold-blooded and calculating, as his last outbreak seemed to prove, and can
become as brave and true a soldier as Strahan, I will make amends by treating him as I do Strahan,
and will try to feel as friendly towards him.  He shall not have the right to say I'm 'not
a woman but a fanatic.'"

She proved herself a woman by the effort to make excuses for one towards whom she had been
severe, by her tendency to relent after she had punished to her heart's content.

"But," added the girl aloud, in the solitude of her room, "while I may give him my hand in
some degree of kindliness and friendship, if he shows a different spirit, he shall never have
my colors, never my loyal and almost sisterly love, until he has shown the courage and manhood
of Mr. Lane and Mr. Strahan. They shall have the first place until a better knight appears."

When, one September evening, her father quietly entered his home he gave her an impulse towards
convalescence beyond the power of all remedies. There were in time mutual confidences, though
his were but partial, because relating to affairs foreign to her life, and tending to create
useless anxieties in respect to the future. He was one of those sagacious, fearless agents
whom the government, at that period, employed in many and secret ways. For obvious reasons
the nature and value of their services will never be fully known.

Marian was unreserved in her relation of what had occurred, and her father smiled and reassured
her.

"In one sense you are right," he said. "We should have a broader, kindlier charity for all
sorts of people, and remember that, since we do not know their antecedents and the influences
leading to their actions, we should not be hasty to judge. Your course might have been more
Christian-like towards young Merwyn, it is true. Coming from you, however, in your present
state of development, it was very natural, and I'm not sure but he richly deserved your words.
If he has good mettle he will be all the better for them. If he spoke from mere impulse and
goes back to his old life and associations, I'm glad my little girl was loyal and brave enough
to lodge in his memory truths that he won't forget. Take the good old doctrine to your relenting
heart and don't forgive him until he 'brings forth fruits meet for repentance.' I'm proud of
you that you gave the young aristocrat such a wholesome lesson in regard to genuine American
manhood and womanhood."

Mrs. Vosburgh's reception of her husband was a blending of welcome and reproaches. What right
had he to overwhelm them with anxiety, etc., etc.?

"The right of about a million men who are taking part in the struggle," he replied, laughing
at her good-naturedly.

"But I can't permit or endure it any longer," said his wife, and there was irritation in her
protest.

"Well, my dear," he replied, with a shrug, "I must remain among the eccentric millions who
continue to act according to their own judgment."

"Mamma!" cried Marian, who proved that she was getting well by a tendency to speak sharply,
"do you wish papa to be poorer-spirited than any of the million? What kind of a man would he
be should he reply, 'Just as you say, my dear; I've no conscience, or will of my own'? I do
not believe that any girl in the land will suffer more than I when those I love are in danger,
but I'd rather die than blockade the path of duty with my love."

"Yes, and some day when you are fatherless you may repent those words," sobbed Mrs. Vosburgh.

"This will not answer," said Mr. Vosburgh, in a tone that quieted both mother and daughter,
who at this stage were inclined to be a little hysterical. "A moment's rational thought will
convince you that words cannot influence me. I know exactly what I owe to you and to my country,
and no earthly power can change my course a hair's breadth. If I should be brought home dead
to-morrow, Marian would not have the shadow of a reason for self-reproach. She would have no
more to do with it than with the sunrise. Your feelings, in both instances, are natural enough,
and no doubt similar scenes are taking place all over the land; but men go just the same, as
they should do and always have done in like emergencies. So wipe away your tears, little women.
You have nothing to cry about yet, while many have."

The master mind controlled and quieted them. Mrs. Vosburgh looked at her husband a little curiously,
and it dawned upon her more clearly than ever before that the man whom she managed, as she
fancied, was taking his quiet, resolute way through life with his own will at the helm.

Marian thought, "Ah, why does not mamma idolize such a man and find her best life in making
the most of his life?"

She had, as yet, scarcely grasped the truth that, as disease enfeebles the body, so selfishness
disables the mind, robbing it of the power to care for others, or to understand them. In a
sense Mr.  Vosburgh would always be a stranger to his wife. He had philosophically and patiently
accepted the fact, and was making the best of the relation as it existed.

It was now decided that the family should return at once to their city home. Mr. Vosburgh had
a few days of leisure to superintend the removal, and then his duties would become engrossing.

The evening before their departure was one of mild, charming beauty, and as the dining-room
was partially dismantled, it was Mr. Vosburgh's fancy to have the supper-table spread on the
veranda. The meal was scarcely finished when a tall, broad-shouldered man appeared at the foot
of the steps, and Sally, the pretty waitress, manifested a blushing consciousness of his presence.

"Wud Mr. Vosburgh let me spake to him a moment?" began the stranger.

Marian recognized the voice that, from the shrubbery, had given utterance to the indignant
protest against traits which had once characterized her own life and motives. Thinking it possible
that her memory was at fault, she glanced at Sally's face and the impression was confirmed.
"What ages have passed since that June evening!" she thought.

"Is it anything private, my man?" asked Mr. Vosburgh, pushing back his chair and lighting a cigar.

"Faix, zur, it's nothin' oi'm ashamed on. I wish to lave the country and get a place on the
perlace force," repeated the man, with an alacrity which showed that he wished Sally to hear
his request.

"You look big and strong enough to handle most men."

"Ye may well say that, zur; oi've not sane the man yit that oi was afeared on."

Sally chuckled over her knowledge that this was not true in respect to women, while Marian
whispered to her father: "Secure him the place if you can, papa. You owe a great deal to him
and so do I, although he does not know it. This is the man whose words, spoken to Sally, disgusted
me with my old life. Don't you remember?"

Mr. Vosburgh's eyes twinkled, as he shot a swift glance at Sally, whose face was redder than
the sunset. The man's chief attraction to the city was apparent.

"What's your name?" the gentleman asked.

"Barney Ghegan, zur."

"Are you perfectly loyal to the North? Will you help carry out the laws, even against your
own flesh and blood, if necessary?"

"Oi'll 'bey orders, zur," replied the man, emphatically. "Oi've come to Amarekay to stay, and
oi'll stan' by the goovernment."

"Can you bring me a certificate of your character?"

"Oi can, zur, for foive years aback."

"Bring it then, Barney, and you shall go on the force; for you're a fine, strong-looking man,--the
kind needed in these days," said Mr.  Vosburgh, glad to do a good turn for one who unwittingly
had rendered him so great a service, and also amused at this later aspect of the affair.

This amusement was greatly enhanced by observing Barney's proud, triumphant glance at Sally.
Turning quickly to note its effect on the girl, Mr. Vosburgh caught the coquettish maid in
the act of making a grimace at her much-tormented suitor.

Sally's face again became scarlet, and in embarrassed haste she began to clear the table.

Barney was retiring slowly, evidently wishing for an interview with his elusive charmer before
he should return to his present employers, and Mr. Vosburgh good-naturedly put in a word in
his favor.

"Stay, Barney, and have some supper before you go home. In behalf of Mrs. Vosburgh I give you
a cordial invitation."

"Yes," added the lady, who had been quietly laughing. "Now that you are to be so greatly promoted
we shall be proud to have you stay."

Barney doffed his hat and exclaimed, "Long loife to yez all, espacially to the swate-faced
young leddy that first spoke a good wourd for me, oi'm a-thinkin';" and he stepped lightly
around to the rear of the house.

"Sally," said Mr. Vosburgh, with preternatural gravity.

The girl courtesied and nearly dropped a dish.

"Mr. Barney Ghegan will soon be receiving a large salary."

Sally courtesied again, but her black eyes sparkled as she whisked the rest of the things from
the table and disappeared. She maintained her old tactics during supper and before the other
servants, exulting in the fact that the big, strong man was on pins and needles, devoid of
appetite and peace.

"'Afeared o' no mon,' he says," she thought, smilingly. "He's so afeared o' me that he's jist
a tremblin'."

After her duties were over, Barney said, mopping his brow: "Faix, but the noight is warm. A
stroll in the air wudn't be bad, oi'm a-thinkin'."

"Oi'm cool as a cowcumber," remarked Sally. "We'll wait for ye till ye goes out and gits cooled
off;" and she sat down complacently, while the cook and the laundress tittered.

An angry sparkle began to assert itself in Barney's blue eyes, and he remarked drily, as he
took his hat, "Yez moight wait longer than yez bargained for."

The shrewd girl saw that she was at the length of her chain, and sprung up, saying: "Oh, well,
since the mistress invited ye so politely, ye's company, and it's me duty to thry to entertain
ye. Where shall we go?" she added, as she passed out with him.

"To the rustic sate, sure. Where else shud we go?"

"A rustic sate is a quare place for a stroll."

"Oi shall have so much walkin' on me bate in New York, that it's well to begin settin' down
aready, oi'm a-thinkin'."

"Why, Barney, ye're going to be a reg'lar tramp. Who'd 'a thought that ye'd come down to that."

"Ah! arrah, wid ye nonsense! Sit ye down here, for oi'm a-goin' to spake plain the noight.
Noo, by the Holy Vargin, oi'm in arenest. Are ye goin' to blow hot, or are ye goin' to blow could?"

"Considerin' the hot night, Barney, wouldn't it be better for me to blow could?"

Barney scratched his head in perplexity. "Ye know what I mane," he ejaculated.

"Where will ye foind the girl that tells all she knows?"

"O Sally, me darlint, what's the use of batin' around the bush? Ye know that a cat niver looked
at crame as oi look on ye," said Barney, in a wheedling tone, and trying the tactics of coaxing
once more.

He sat down beside her and essayed with his insinuating arm to further his cause as his words
had not done.

"Arrah, noo, Barney Ghegan, what liberties wud ye be takin' wid a respectable girl?" and she
drew away decidedly.

He sprung to his feet and exploded in the words: "Sally Maguire, will ye be me woife? By the
holy poker! Answer, yis or no."

Sally rose, also, and in equally pronounced tones replied: "Yes, Barney Ghegan, I will, and
I'll be a good and faithful one, too. It's yeself that's been batin' round the bush. Did ye
think a woman was a-goin' to chase ye over hill and down dale and catch ye by the scruff of
the neck? What do ye take me for?"

"Oi takes ye for better, Sally, me darlint;" and then followed sounds suggesting the popping
of a dozen champagne corks.

Mr. Vosburgh, his wife, and Marian had been chatting quietly on the piazza, unaware of the
scene taking place in the screening shrubbery until Barney's final question had startled the
night like a command to "stand and deliver."

Repressing laughter with difficulty they tiptoed into the house and closed the door.

CHAPTER XVIII.

A GIRL'S STANDARD.

THE month of September, 1862, was a period of strong excitement and profound anxiety on both
sides of the vague and shifting line which divided the loyal North from the misguided but courageous
South.  During the latter part of August Gen. Pope had been overwhelmed with disaster, and
what was left of his heroic army was driven within the fortifications erected for the defence
of Washington. Apparently the South had unbounded cause for exultation. But a few weeks before
their capital had been besieged by an immense army, while a little to the north, upon the Rappahannock,
rested another Union army which, under a leader like Stonewall Jackson, would have been formidable
enough in itself to tax Lee's skill and strength to the utmost. Except in the immediate vicinity
of the capital and Fortress Monroe scarcely a National soldier had been left in Virginia. The
Confederates might proudly claim that the generalship of Lee and the audacity of Jackson had
swept the Northern invaders from the State.

Even more important than the prestige and glory won was the fact that the Virginian farmers
were permitted to gather their crops unmolested. The rich harvests of the Shenandoah Valley
and other regions, that had been and should have been occupied by National troops, were allowed
to replenish the Confederate granaries. There were rejoicings and renewed confidence in Southern
homes, and smiles of triumph on the faces of sympathizers abroad and throughout the North.

But the astute leaders of the Rebellion were well aware that the end had not yet come, and
that, unless some bold, paralyzing blow was struck, the struggle was but fairly begun. In response
to the request for more men new armies were springing up at the North. The continent shook
under the tread of hosts mustering with the stern purpose that the old flag should cover every
inch of the heritage left by our fathers.

Therefore, Lee was not permitted to remain on the defensive a moment, but was ordered to cross
the Potomac in the rear of Washington, threatening that city and Baltimore. It was supposed
that the advent of a Southern army into Maryland would create such an enthusiastic uprising
that thinned ranks would be recruited, and the State brought into close relation with the Confederate
Government. These expectations were not realized. The majority sympathized with Barbara Frietchie,

"Bravest of all in Frederick town,"

rather than with their self-styled deliverers; and Lee lost more by desertion from his own
ranks than he gained in volunteers. In this same town of Frederick, by strange carelessness
on the part of the rebels, was left an order which revealed to McClellan Lee's plans and the
positions which his divided army were to occupy during the next few days. Rarely has history
recorded such opportunities as were thus accidentally given to the Union commander.

The ensuing events proved that McClellan's great need was not the reinforcements for which
he so constantly clamored, but decision and energy of character. Had he possessed these qualities
he could have won for himself, from the fortuitous order which fell into his hands, a wreath
of unfading laurel, and perhaps have saved almost countless lives of his fellow-countrymen.
As it was, if he had only advanced his army a little faster, the twelve thousand Union soldiers,
surrendered by the incompetent and pusillanimous Gen. Miles, would have been saved from the
horrors of captivity and secured as a valuable reinforcement. To the very last, fortune appeared
bent on giving him opportunity. The partial success won on the 17th of September, at the battle
of Antietam, might easily have been made a glorious victory if McClellan had had the vigor
to put in enough troops, especially including Burnside's corps, earlier in the day. Again,
on the morning of the 18th, he had only to take the initiative, as did Grant after the first
day's fighting at Shiloh, and Lee could scarcely have crossed the Potomac with a corporal's
guard. But, as usual, he hesitated, and the enemy that robbed him of one of the highest places
in history was not the Confederate general or his army, but a personal trait,--indecision.
In the dawn of the 19th he sent out his cavalry to reconnoitre, and learned that his antagonist
was safe in Virginia. Fortune, wearied at last, finally turned her back upon her favorite.
The desperate and bloody battle resulted in little else than the ebb of the tide of war southward.
Northern people, it is true, breathed more freely. Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington
were safe for the present, but this seemed a meagre reward for millions of treasure and tens
of thousands of lives, especially when the capture of Richmond and the end of the Rebellion
had been so confidently promised.

If every village and hamlet in the land was profoundly stirred by these events, it can well
be understood that the commercial centre of New York throbbed like an irritated nerve under
the telegraph wires concentring there from the scenes of action. Every possible interest, every
variety of feeling, was touched in its vast and heterogeneous population, and the social atmosphere
was electrical with excitement.

From her very constitution, now that she had begun to comprehend the nature of the times, Marian
Vosburgh could not breathe this air in tranquillity. She was, by birthright, a spirited, warm-hearted
girl, possessing all a woman's disposition towards partisanship. Everything during the past
few months had tended to awaken a deep interest in the struggle, and passing events intensified
it. Not only in the daily press did she eagerly follow the campaign, but from her father she
learned much that was unknown to the general public. To a girl of mind the great drama in itself
could not fail to become absorbing, but when it is remembered that those who had the strongest
hold upon her heart were imperilled actors in the tragedy, the feeling with which she watched
the shifting scenes may in some degree be appreciated. She often saw her father's brow clouded
with deep anxiety, and dreaded that each new day might bring orders which would again take
him into danger.

While the letters of her loyal friend, Lane, veiled all that was hard and repulsive in his
service, she knew that the days of drill and equipment would soon be over, and that the new
regiment must participate in the dangers of active duty. This was equally true of Strahan and
Blauvelt. She laughed heartily over their illustrated journal, which, in the main, gave the
comic side of their life. But she never laid it aside without a sigh, for she read much between
the lines, and knew that the hour of battle was rapidly approaching. Thus far they had been
within the fortifications at Washington, for the authorities had learned the folly of sending
undisciplined recruits to the front.

At last, when the beautiful month of October was ended, and Lee's shattered army was rested
and reorganized, McClellan once more crossed the Potomac. Among the reinforcements sent to
him were the regiments of which Lane and Strahan were members. The letters of her friends proved
that they welcomed the change and with all the ardor of brave, loyal men looked forward to
meeting the enemy. In heart and thought she went with them, but a sense of their danger fell,
like a shadow, across her spirit. She appeared years older than the thoughtless girl for whom
passing pleasure and excitement had been the chief motives of life; but in the strengthening
lines of her face a womanly beauty was developing which caused even strangers to turn and glance
after her.

If Merwyn still retained some hold upon her thoughts and curiosity, so much could scarcely
be said of her sympathy. He had disappeared from the moment when she had harshly dismissed
him, and she was beginning to feel that she had been none too severe, and to believe that his
final words had been spoken merely from impulse. If he were amusing himself abroad, Marian,
in her intense loyalty, would despise him; if he were permitting himself to be identified with
his mother's circle of Southern sympathizers, the young girl's contempt would be tinged with
detestation. He had approached her too nearly, and humiliated her too deeply, to be readily
forgotten or forgiven.  His passionate outbreak at last had been so intense as to awaken strong
echoes in her woman's soul. If return to a commonplace fashionable life was to be the only
result of the past, she would scarcely ever think of him without an angry sparkle in her eyes.

After she had learned that her friends were in the field and therefore exposed to the dangers
of battle at any time, she had soliloquized, bitterly: "He promised to 'measure everything
by the breadth of my woman's soul.' What does he know about a true woman's soul? He has undoubtedly
found his selfish nature and his purse more convenient gauges of the world. Well, he knows
of one girl who cannot be bought."

Her unfavorable impression was confirmed one cold November morning. Passing down Madison Avenue,
her casual attention was attracted by the opening of a door on the opposite side of the street.
She only permitted her swift glance to take in the fact that it was Merwyn who descended the
steps and entered an elegant coupe driven by a man in a plain livery. After the vehicle had
been whirled away, curiosity prompted her to retrace her steps that she might look more closely
at the residence of the man who had asked her to be his wife. It was evidently one of the finest
and most substantial houses on the avenue.

A frown contracted. the young girl's brow as she muttered: "He aspired to my hand,--he, who
fares sumptuously in that brown-stone palace while such men as Mr. Lane are fortunate to have
a canvas roof over their heads. He had the narrowness of mind to half-despise Arthur Strahan,
who left equal luxury to face every danger and hardship. Thank Heaven I planted some memories
in his snobbish soul!"

Thereafter she avoided that locality.

In the evening, with words scarcely less bitter, she mentioned to her father the fact that
she had seen Merwyn and his home.

Mr. Vosburgh smiled and said, "You have evidently lost all compunctions in regard to your treatment
of the young fellow."

"I have, indeed. The battle of Antietam alone would place a Red Sea between me and any young
American who can now live a life of selfish luxury. Think how thousands of our brave men will
sleep this stormy night on the cold, rain-soaked ground, and then think of his cold-blooded
indifference to it all!"

"Why think of him at all, Marian?" her father asked, with a quizzical smile.

The color deepened slightly in her face as she replied: "Why shouldn't I think of him to some
extent? He has crossed my path in no ordinary way. His attentions at first were humiliating,
and he awakened an antipathy such as I never felt towards any one before. He tried to belittle
you, my friends, and the cause to which you are devoted. Then, when I told him the truth about
himself, he appeared to have manhood enough to comprehend it. His words made me think of a
man desperately wounded, and my sympathies were touched, and I felt that I had been unduly
severe and all that. In fact, I was overwrought, ill, morbid, conscience-stricken as I remembered
my own past life, and he appeared to feel what I said so awfully that I couldn't forget it.
I had silly dreams and hopes that he would assert his manhood and take a loyal part in the
struggle. But what has been his course? So far as I can judge, it has been in keeping with
his past. Settling down to a life of ease and money-making here would be little better, in
my estimation, than amusing himself abroad. It would be simply another phase of following his
own mood and inclinations; and I shall look upon his outburst and appeal as hysterical rather
than passionate and sincere."

Mr. Vosburgh listened, with a half-amused expression, to his daughter's indignant and impetuous
words, but only remarked, quietly, "Suppose you find that you have judged Mr. Merwyn unjustly?"

"I don't think I have done so. At any rate, one can only judge from what one knows."

"Stick to that. Your present impressions and feelings do you credit, and I am glad that your
friends' loyal devotion counts for more in your esteem than Merwyn's wealth. Still, in view
of your scheme of life to make the most and best of men of brains and force, I do not think
you have given the young nabob time and opportunity to reveal himself fully. He may have recently
returned from England, and, since his mother was determined to reside abroad, it was his duty
to establish her well before returning. You evidently have not dismissed him from your thoughts.
Since that is true, do not condemn him utterly until you see what he does. What if he again
seeks your society?"

"Well, I don't know, papa. As I feel to-night I never wish to see him again."

"I'm not sure of that, little girl. You are angry and vindictive. If he were a nonentity you
would be indifferent."

"Astute papa! That very fact perplexes me. But haven't I explained why I cannot help thinking
of him to some extent?"

"No, not even to yourself."

Marian bit her lip with something like vexation, then said, reproachfully, "Papa, you can't
think that I care for him?"

"Oh, no,--not in the sense indicated by your tone. But your silly dreams and hopes, as you
characterize them, have taken a stronger hold upon you than you realize. You are disappointed
as well as angry. You have entertained the thought that he might do something, or become more
in harmony with the last words he spoke to you."

"Well, he hasn't."

"You have not yet given him sufficient time, perhaps. I shall not seek to influence you in
the matter, but the question still presents itself: What if he again seeks your society and
shows a disposition to make good his words?"

"I shall not show him," replied Marian, proudly, "greater favor than such friends as Mr. Lane
and Mr. Strahan required. Without being influenced by me, they decided to take part in the
war. After they had taken the step which did so much credit to their manly courage and loyalty,
they came and told me of it. If Mr. Merwyn should show equal spirit and patriotism and be very
humble in view of the past, I should, of course, feel differently towards him. It is very probable that
old Handel was irritated by the sound of his son's early efforts
and regarded music as a waste of time; his wife may perhaps have encouraged
the child's obvious abilities, taking care that he made music only
in some part of the house where he would not disturb his father.

At the age of seven he was sent to the Lutheran Grammar School, and he may very likely have had some instruction
in singing while there. In any case there can be no doubt that he was taught more than the mere rudiments
of music in childhood, however severe his father's opposition may
have been.

He was between seven and nine when his father took him to Weissenfels,
where he was required to attend on the Duke. It is quite probable that
the child may have been taken there several times, especially as
a relative of his was in regular service in the Duke's establishment.

One day he was allowed to play on the organ in the palace chapel;
the Duke happened to hear him, made enquiries as to who the player
was, and at once urged on the father the duty of having him properly
trained for a musical career.

Old Handel remained obstinate; he was determined that his son should have a
liberal education and become a lawyer. By his own efforts he had
raised himself to a position of some distinction and affluence; it
was only natural that he should wish his son to enter on life with
better advantages than he himself had enjoyed.

He at any rate followed the advice of the Duke so far as to place
the boy under the musical tuition of Friedrich Zachow, the organist
of the Lutheran church at Halle.

The next episode in George Frederic's career has considerably puzzled his biographers. Mainwaring
asserts that in 1698 he went to Berlin, where he was presented to the Electress Sophia Charlotte and
made the acquaintance of Ariosti and Giovanni Battista Buononcini, two famous Italian opera
composers whom he was to encounter again, in London, many years later. But it is known that Ariosti
did not arrive in Berlin until the spring of 1697, and Buononcini not until 1702. And as old
Handel died in February 1697, his son cannot have been in Berlin later than about the end of 1696,
if it is true (as Mainwaring says) that the Elector offered to send
him to Italy, an offer which the father firmly refused to accept for
him.

If, on the other hand, Mainwaring is right in saying that young Handel
went to Berlin with a view to obtaining a musical post there, it is
hardly likely that he should have made the journey at ten years of
age, and while his father was still living.

It seems much more probable that if he ever did visit Berlin it was when he was of an age to
form his own judgments as to his future career.

Three days before his seventeenth birthday he matriculated as a law student of the University of Halle,
but music must have been the chief occupation of his time.

The composer Telemann, four years his senior, spoke of him as being
already a musician of importance at Halle when he first met him there, probably
in 1700. In March 1702 he was appointed organist at the Cathedral, although
he belonged to the Lutheran Church, whereas the Cathedral was Calvinist;
considerable scandal had been caused by the intemperance of the Cathedral
organist, one Leporin, who was finally dismissed.

That Handel should have been given the post at so early an age points
to his ability and trustworthiness of character; it also suggests
that efficient organists were rare among the Calvinist musicians.

Mainwaring unjustly credited Zachow with Leporin's love of a cheerful glass,
and other biographers have perhaps for this reason greatly underrated
Zachow's musicianship.

Zachow cannot indeed be classed as a great composer, but he was considerably
more than merely a sound average teacher.

For one thing, he possessed a large library of music. Handel was not only made to master the arts of counterpoint
and fugue, but he was also set to study the works of other composers, and to train his sense of
style by writing music in direct imitation of them. In those days there was no possibility of buying
all sorts of music ready printed. Printing was expensive, and generally clumsy in execution as well; most
music was copied by hand, and a musician who wished to acquire a library of music generally did so by borrowing
it and copying it. Zachow employed Handel to copy music for him, and no doubt he copied a great
deal for himself. Although the opportunities for hearing music would
not be very liberal in a town like Halle, Handel, under Zachow, became a
well-read musician as well as an accomplished one.

During the seventeenth century the chief contribution of Germany to the art of music was religious, just
as the German hymns were her chief contribution to poetry. In Italy, on the other hand, sacred music was
of minor importance as compared with the development of opera. But in all music Italy led the way, and German
sacred music was constantly influenced by the Italians, with the
result that Italian dramatic methods were often used by German composers
of sacred music, not with any loss of seriousness and dignity to
its character, but rather to the intenser expression of that deep
personal religious feeling which characterised both the poetry and
the music of the Protestant nations.

Zachow was well acquainted with the Italian masters, and his own Church
music shows a vivid dramatic sense; it is easy to see how much Handel
learned from him.

But although Church cantatas and organ music may have sufficed for the majority of the innumerable
worthy German musicians of those days, the form of music which excited the curiosity and interest
of the livelier spirits was certainly opera. By 1700, opera had established itself all over Italy,
supported mainly by the great princes, but at Venice maintained on
a commercial basis by the citizens themselves since 1637.

The first attempt at a German opera was made by Heinrich Schuetz, at
Torgau, ten years earlier. Vienna introduced Italian opera in 1631, and,
generally speaking, the Catholic princes of Germany, who one after
another followed the example of Vienna, preferred opera in Italian.

Protestant Germany inclined more to opera in its own language, though
towards the end of the century Italian gradually gained the upper
hand at the more important courts.

Native German opera owed its origin partly to the visit of the English comedians early in the
century, and partly to the musical plays acted by school-boys; from the English "jigs" came the
use of short popular songs, and from the school plays the tendency
of the early German operas to be of a more or less sacred or edifying
character.

Handel's friend, the composer Telemann, tells us that it was not unusual
for students from the University of Leipzig to go to Berlin to hear
the Italian opera, which had been established by the Electress Sophia
Charlotte in 1700, and this suggests that Handel's visit to Berlin
may have taken place in 1703 rather than in his childhood.

But he certainly had opportunities for seeing operas nearer home. There had been many German operas
performed at Halle itself during the twenty years before Handel's
birth, and Duke Johann Adolf opened an opera-house at Weissenfels
in 1685, in which Philipp Krieger produced German operas regularly
for the next thirty years.

There was thus every reason for young Handel's growing ambitious to become a composer for the stage,
although we have no evidence of his having ever attempted dramatic
composition until he left Halle in 1703.

The most important of all the north German opera-houses was that of
Hamburg, where the opera did not depend on the patronage of a court,
but was organised, as at Venice, as a public entertainment.

Hamburg had attempted German opera as early as 1648, and it is interesting
to note that the English composer William Brade was one of those who
provided the music; but the real history of the Hamburg opera may
be said to begin with the performance of Theile's Adam and Eve in
the newly built theatre in the Goose-Market in 1678.

When Handel arrived in Hamburg in the summer of 1703 the biblical operas had long come to an end,
and the theatre was under the management of Reinhold Keiser.

Keiser was a musician of remarkable genius.

His father was a disreputable organist, and his mother a young lady of noble family who had been hastily
married at the age of sixteen. Born near Weissenfels in 1674, he had
begun his operatic career at Brunswick at the age of eighteen; three
years later he took over the direction of the opera at Hamburg, where
he produced a large number of operas composed by himself.

As a composer, Keiser had a singular fluency of melody in a style
that hovers between those of Germany and Italy; had he been a man
of more solid character he might have accomplished greater things.

But he had inherited from his parents a love of pleasure and debauchery;
extravagant in his private life, he was no less extravagant in his
theatrical management, and was ready to provide his audiences with
anything in the way of startling sensation.

One of his most famous operas was on the subject of Stoertebeker,
a notorious highwayman (1704), in which murders were represented with
the most disgusting realism.

Hamburg was the Venice of the north and, like Venice, a city of pleasure;
but its pleasures were often of a coarse and licentious description.
Life in Hamburg was probably not much unlike that of Restoration
London; but though Keiser may well be set beside Purcell, Hamburg
had no dramatists to compare with Congreve, hardly even with Shadwell.

Jeremy Collier, however, was far outdone in vituperation by the puritan clergy who, not altogether
without reason, castigated the immorality of the Hamburg stage.

Handel seems to have arrived in Hamburg in early summer of 1703,
for we first hear of him there on July 2, when he met Johann Mattheson
in the church of St. Mary Magdalen.

It seems to have been a chance acquaintance, to judge from Mattheson's
account; it stuck in Mattheson's memory for many years and he remembered
especially the pastry-cook's boy who blew the organ for Handel and
himself.

Mattheson was four years older than Handel; he was one of those precociously gifted, versatile,
attractive, and rather vain young men who are endowed with so many talents that they never achieve
distinction in any branch of art.

He is remembered now only by the literary work of his later life, in which he shows himself as a voluminous
pedant and an embittered critic. He made friends with Handel on the spot, and took him under
his own protection, providing him with almost daily free meals at his father's house. He evidently
regarded him as a very simple and provincial young musician, a notable organist indeed, and
a master of such learned devices as counterpoint and fugue, but a dull composer, turning out endless
arias and cantatas with no sense of the fashionable Italian taste.

It was Mattheson, by his own account, who introduced Handel to the musical
life of Hamburg. The opera was closed for the summer, and Keiser's celebrated
winter concerts, at which the wealthy society of Hamburg listened to
the most famous singers and regaled themselves with tokay, had not
yet begun; but there was no lack of social distractions, in which
music no doubt played its part.

In August the two friends made a journey to Lubeck, to compete for the post of organist at the
Marienkirche in succession to Dietrich Buxtehude, who was nearly seventy and ready to retire.
But both Buxtehude and the town council insisted that the new organist
should marry his predecessor's daughter, in order to save the town
the necessity of providing for her; she was considerably older than
the two youthful candidates, and they both withdrew in haste.

Late in life Mattheson married the daughter of an English clergyman; Handel remained a bachelor
to the end of his days.

It was no doubt through Mattheson that Handel, in the autumn, entered the opera band as a humble
second violinist. He seems to have been of a very retiring and quiet disposition, although
of a dry humour. Opera management at Hamburg was no less precarious
than it was in London; Keiser could not afford the Italian singers patronised
by the German princes, and his performances had often to be helped
out by amateurs of all classes.

On one occasion the harpsichord-player failed him; Handel took his place
at short notice, and his musicianship was at once recognised. Unfortunately
Mattheson, whose chronology is always rather uncertain, does not tell us
when this occurred. In addition to his duties in the orchestra, Handel
earned a living by teaching private pupils, and through Mattheson
he was engaged by Mr. John Wyche, the English Envoy, as music-master
to his small son Cyril.

Early in 1704 Mattheson went to Holland, where he had some success
in organising concerts at Amsterdam, and was offered the post of
organist at Haarlem.

He seems to have had some idea of seeking his fortune in England; he spoke English well, and
may have had useful connexions in England through Mr. John Wyche. But in March Handel wrote to
him that the Hamburg opera could not get on without him, and to Hamburg
he returned.

It soon must have become clear to him that Handel was rapidly outgrowing
any need of his condescending patronage. A Passion according to St.
John, the words of which had been written by Postel, an opera-poet
turned pietist, had been set to music by Handel, and performed on
Good Friday with marked success.

Mattheson arrived too late to hear it, but it is significant that twenty years later he published
a scathing criticism of it, although it is a work of little importance
in relation to Handel's complete career, and can seldom have been
performed.

A Passion oratorio by Keiser was produced at the same time, it may
well have been that Handel's work, youthful and conventional as it is,
was enough to arouse the jealousy of both Keiser and Mattheson.

Shortly after Easter, Keiser began the composition of a new opera,
Almira, on a libretto by the local poet Feustking, but for some reason
or other he found it necessary to call in Handel's assistance, and
eventually left the whole work to Handel to compose.

It was to be produced in the autumn. Handel seems to have consulted
Mattheson over every detail of the opera; there exists a complete
score in Mattheson's handwriting, with corrections and additions by
Handel.

Mattheson spent the summer enjoying a country holiday in Mecklenburg;
Handel probably went on with his opera, at Hamburg.

In October, just as the opera season was reopening, Mattheson contrived to get himself engaged
by Sir Cyril Wych as tutor to his son; he also took over the boy's
musical education, hinting that Handel was dismissed for neglect of
his duties.

In view of Handel's strictly honourable character it is difficult
to believe that he was guilty of neglect, and we may naturally suppose
him to have resented the loss of a lucrative appointment.

The first opera of the autumn was not Handel's Almira, but an opera
by Mattheson, called Cleopatra. Mattheson, always eager to exhibit his
versatility, sang the part of Antony himself, and, not content with
that, came into the orchestra as soon as Antony had died on the stage
and kept himself in view of the audience by conducting at the harpsichord.

For several performances Handel made no objection and gave up his seat
to Mattheson when the moment came, but on December 5, for some reason
or other, he refused, to the surprise and indignation of the composer.

German musicians in those days were a quarrelsome crew; at the court
of Stuttgart the musicians were so much given to knocking each other
on the head with their instruments, even in the august presence of
His Serene Highness, that there was hardly one left undamaged.

It was only to be expected that the friends of Handel and Mattheson should
egg them on to fight a duel in the street; luckily Mattheson's sword
broke on a button of Handel's coat, and the duel ended.

On December 30 a town councillor effected a reconciliation; the rivals
dined together at Mattheson's house and went on to the rehearsal
of Almira, which was brought out on January 8, 1705, with Mattheson
as the principal tenor.

Almira, the libretto of which was partly in German and partly in Italian,
ran continuously for about twenty performances until February 25,
when it was succeeded by Nero, another opera which Handel had hastily
composed for the occasion.

Nero, in which Mattheson sang the title part, was a failure. The
music is lost, but the libretto survives, and that is enough to account
for the collapse.

The opera had three performances only. In the very same season Keiser re-set
Nero to music himself, and brought it out under the title of Octavia;
shortly afterwards he did the same with Almira, which was performed
in August of the same year.

Although Keiser's operas were no more successful than Handel's, and his extravagance and mismanagement
forced him to leave Hamburg for three years in order to avoid imprisonment,
it is evident that he had made Handel's position in the theatre impossible.

Handel withdrew into private life and devoted himself to earning a living by teaching. Mattheson says
that Handel remained in Hamburg until 1709, and that he still worked
in the theatre, but the first of these statements is certainly untrue,
and the second probably so.

Mattheson himself left the theatre after the failure of Handel's Nero, and his friendship with Handel
seems to have come to an end. About Handel's subsequent life in Hamburg we know nothing, until the
theatre was taken over by one Saurbrey in the autumn of 1706. Saurbrey commissioned an opera from
Handel, but, owing to the confusion in which Keiser had left the
affairs of the theatre, it could not be brought out until January
1708, when it was found to be so long that it had to be divided into
two operas, Florindo and Daphne, both of which were put on the stage
successively.

By that time Handel had left Hamburg for Italy; he evidently took
little interest in the production of these works, neither of which
has survived.

It was during the run of Almira, says Mainwaring, that Handel made
the acquaintance of Prince Gian Gastone de' Medici, son of the Grand
Duke Cosmo III of Tuscany.

Mainwaring's date is wrong, for it is known that Gian Gastone at that time was in Bohemia with his
wife, a German princess, to whom he had been married against his will. But it is also known
that he was in Hamburg for a few months during the winter of 1703-04, and, if he met Handel
at that time, the rest of Mainwaring's story becomes much more credible than subsequent biographers
have been willing to admit. According to Mainwaring, Handel became almost an intimate friend
of the Prince; they often discussed music together, and the Prince
lamented that Handel was unacquainted with the music and musical life
of Italy.

"Handel confessed that he could see nothing in Italian music which answered the high character His
Highness had given it.

On the contrary, he thought it so very indifferent, that the singers,
he said, must be angels to recommend it."

Gian Gastone urged him to come to Italy and hear for himself, intimating
"that if he chose to return with him, no conveniences should be wanting."

Handel declined the invitation, but resolved to go to Italy as soon
as he could do so "on his own bottom."

Gian Gastone was a spendthrift and a profligate; his moral reputation
was of the worst, and he was chronically in debt. Merwyn
also knew that he would ever be compared with those near friends now in Virginia.

What did he hope? What could he hope? He scarcely knew, and would not even entertain the questions.
He was only too glad that the door was not closed to him, and, with the innate hopefulness
of youth, he would leave the future to reveal its possibilities. He was so thoroughly his father's
son that he would not be disheartened, and so thoroughly himself that the course he preferred
would be the one followed, so far as was now possible.

"Well?" said Mr. Vosburgh, when Marian came to the library to kiss him good-night.

"What a big, long question that little word contains!" she cried, laughing, and there was a
little exhilaration in her manner which did not escape him.

"You may tell me much, little, or nothing."

"I will tell you nothing, then, for there is nothing to tell. I received and parted with Mr.
Merwyn on his terms, and those you know all about. Mamma was quite gracious, and my guests
were polite to him."

"Are you willing to tell me what impression he made in respect to his loyalty?"

"Shrewd papa! You think this the key to the problem. Perhaps it is, if there is any problem.
Well, so far as WORDS went he proved his loyalty in an incidental way, and is evidently informing
himself concerning events. If he has no better proof to offer than words, his probation will
end unfavorably, even though he may not be immediately aware of the fact. Of course, now that
I have granted his request, I must be polite to him so long as he chooses to come."

"Was he as complacent and superior as ever?"

"Whither is your subtlety tending? Are you, as well as mamma, an ally of Mr. Merwyn? You know
he was not. Indeed, I must admit that, in manner, he carried out the spirit of his request."

"Then, to use your own words, he was 'befittingly humble'? No, I am not his ally. I am disposed
to observe the results of your experiment."

"There shall be no experimenting, papa. Circumstances have enabled him to understand me as
well as he ever can, and he must act in view of what he knows me to be. I shall not seek to
influence him, except by being myself, nor shall I lower my standard in his favor."

"Very well, I shall note his course with some interest. It is evident, however, that the uncertainties
of his future action will not keep either of us awake."

When she left him, he fell into a long revery, and his concluding thoughts were: "I doubt whether
Marian understands herself in respect to this young fellow. She is too resentful. She does
not feel the indifference which she seeks to maintain. The subtle, and, as yet, unrecognized
instinct of her womanhood leads her to stand aloof. This would be the natural course of a girl
like Marian towards a man who, for any cause, had gained an unusual hold upon her thoughts.
I must inform myself thoroughly in regard to this Mr.  Merwyn. Thus far her friends have given
me little solicitude; but here is one, towards whom she is inclined to be hostile, that it
may be well to know all about. Even before she is aware of it herself, she is on the defensive
against him, and this, to a student of human nature, is significant. She virtually said to-night
that he must win his way and make his own unaided advances toward manhood. Ah, my little girl!
if it was not in him ever to have greater power over you than Mr. Strahan, you would take a
kindlier interest in his efforts."

If Marian idolized her father as she had said, it can readily be guessed how much she was to
him, and that he was not forgetful of his purpose to learn more about one who manifested so
deep an interest in his daughter, and who possibly had the power to create a responsive interest.
It so happened that he was acquainted with Mr.  Bodoin, and had employed the shrewd lawyer
in some government affairs. Another case had arisen in which legal counsel was required, and
on the following day advice was sought.

When this part of the interview was over, Mr. Vosburgh remarked, casually, "By the way, I believe
you are acquainted with Mr. Willard Merwyn and his affairs."

"Yes," replied the lawyer, at once on the alert.

"Do your relations to Mr. Merwyn permit you to give me some information concerning him?"

The attorney thought rapidly. His client had recently been inquiring about Mr. Vosburgh, and,
therefore, the interest was mutual. On general principles it was important that the latter
should be friendly, for he was a secret and trusted agent of the government, and Mrs. Merwyn's
course might render a friend at court essential. Although the son had not mentioned Marian's
name, Mr. Bodoin shrewdly guessed that she was exerting the influence that had so greatly changed
the young man's views and plans. The calculating lawyer had never imagined that he would play
the role of match-maker, but he was at once convinced that, in the stormy and uncertain times,
Merwyn could scarcely make a better alliance than the one he meditated. Therefore with much
apparent frankness the astute lawyer told Mr. Vosburgh all that was favorable to the young man.

"I think he will prove an unusual character," concluded the lawyer, "for he is manifesting
some of his father's most characteristic traits," and these were mentioned. "When, after attaining
his majority, the son returned from England, he was in many respects little better than a shrewd,
self-indulgent boy, indifferent to everything but his own pleasure, but, for some reason, he
has greatly changed. Responsibility has apparently sobered him and made him thoughtful. I have
also told him much about my old friend and client, his father, and the young fellow is bent
on imitating him. While he is very considerate of his mother and sisters, he has identified
himself with his father's views, and has become a Northern man to the backbone. Even to a degree
contrary to my advice, he insists on investing his means in government bonds."

This information was eminently satisfactory, and even sagacious Mr.  Vosburgh did not suspect
the motives of the lawyer, whom he knew to be eager to retain his good-will, since it was in
his power to give much business to those he trusted.

"I may become Merwyn's ally after all, if he makes good his own and Mr. Bodoin's words," was
his smiling thought, as he returned to his office.

He was too wise, however, to use open influence with his daughter, or to refer to the secret
interview. Matters should take their own course for the present, while he remained a vigilant
observer, for Marian's interest and happiness were dearer to him than his own life.

Merwyn sought to use his privilege judiciously, and concentrated all his faculties on the question
of his standing in Marian's estimation. During the first few weeks, it was evident that his
progress in her favor was slow, if any were made at all. She was polite, she conversed with
him naturally and vivaciously on topics of general interest, but there appeared to be viewless
and impassable barriers between them. Not by word or sign did she seek to influence his action.

She was extremely reticent about herself, and took pains to seem indifferent in regard to his
life and plans, but she was beginning to chafe under what she characterized as his "inaction."
Giving to hospitals and military charities and buying United-States bonds counted for little
in her eyes.

"He parades his loyalty, and would have me think that he looks upon the right to call on me
as a great privilege, but he does not care enough about either me or the country to incur any
risk or hardship."

Thoughts like these were beginning not only to rekindle her old resentment, but also to cause
a vague sense of disappointment. Merwyn had at least accomplished one thing,--he confirmed
her father's opinion that he was not commonplace. Travel, residence abroad, association with
well-bred people, and a taste for reading, had given him a finish which a girl of Marian's
culture could not fail to appreciate. Because he satisfied her taste and eye, she was only
the more irritated by his failure in what she deemed the essential elements of manhood. In
spite of the passionate words he had once spoken, she was beginning to believe that a cold,
calculating persistency was the corner-stone of his character, that even if he were brave enough
to fight, he had deliberately decided to take no risks and enjoy his fortune. If this were
true, she assured herself, he might shoulder the national debt if he chose, but he could never
become her friend.

Then came the terrible and useless slaughter of Fredericksburg. With the fatuity that characterized
the earlier years of the war, the heroic army of the Potomac, which might have annihilated
Lee on previous occasions, was hurled against heights and fortifications that, from the beginning,
rendered the attack hopeless.

Marian's friends were exposed to fearful perils, but passed through the conflict unscathed.
Her heart went out to them in a deeper and stronger sympathy than ever, and Merwyn in contrast
lost correspondingly.

During the remaining weeks of December, she saw that her father was almost haggard from care
and anxiety, and he was compelled to make trips to Washington and even to the front.

"The end has not come yet," he had said to her, after one of these flying visits. "Burnside
has made an awful blunder, but he is eager to retrieve himself, and now has plans on foot that
promise better.  The disaffection among his commanding officers and troops is what I am most
afraid of--more, indeed, than of the rebel army. Unlike his predecessor, he is determined to
move, to act, and I think we may soon hear of another great battle."

Letters from her friends confirmed this view, especially a brief note from Lane, in which the
writer, fearing that it might be his last, had not wholly veiled his deep affection. "I am
on the eve of participating in an immense cavalry movement," it began, "and it may be some
time before I can write to you again, if ever."

The anxiety caused by this missive was somewhat relieved by a humorous account of the recall
of the cavalry force. She then learned, through her father, that the entire army was again
on the move, and that another terrific battle would be fought in a day or two.

"Burnside should cross the Rappahannock to-day or to-morrow, at the latest," Mr. Vosburgh had
remarked at breakfast, to which he had come from the Washington owl-train.

It was the 20th of December, and when the shadows of the early twilight were gathering, Burnside
had, in fact, massed his army at the fords of the river, and his troops, "little Strahan" among
them, were awaiting orders to enter the icy tide in the stealthy effort to gain Lee's left
flank. There are many veterans now living who remember the terrific "storm of wind, rain, sleet,
and snow" that assailed the unsheltered army. It checked further advance more effectually than
if all the rebel forces had been drawn up on the farther shore. After a frightful night, the
Union army was discovered in the dawn by Lee.

Even then Burnside would have crossed, and, in spite of his opponent's preparations and every
other obstacle, would have fought a battle, had he not been paralyzed by a foe with which no
general could cope,--Virginia mud. The army mired helplessly, supply trains could not reach
it. With difficulty the troops were led back to their old quarters, and so ended the disastrous
campaigns of the year, so far as the army of the Potomac was concerned.

The storm that drenched and benumbed the soldiers on the Rappahannock was equally furious in
the city of New York, and Mr.  Vosburgh sat down to dinner frowning and depressed. "It seems
as if fate is against us," he said. "This storm is general, I fear, and may prove more of a
defence to Lee than his fortifications at Fredericksburg. It's bad enough to have to cope with
treachery and disaffection."

"Treachery, papa?"

"Yes, treachery," replied her father, sternly. "Scoundrels in our own army informed Washington
disunionists of the cavalry movement of which Captain Lane wrote you, and these unmolested
enemies at the capital are in constant communication with Lee. When will our authorities and
the North awake to the truth that this is a life-and-death struggle, and that there must be
no more nonsense?"

"Would to Heaven I were a man!" said the young girl. "At this very moment, no doubt, Mr. Merwyn
is enjoying his sumptuous dinner, while my friends may be fording a dark, cold river to meet
their death. Oh! I can't eat anything to-night."

"Nonsense!" cried her mother, irritably.

"Come, little girl, you are taking things too much to heart. I am very glad you are not a man.
In justice, I must also add that Mr. Merwyn is doing more for the cause than any of your friends.
It so happens that I have learned that he is doing a great deal of which little is known."

"Pardon me," cried the girl, almost passionately. "Any man who voluntarily faces this storm,
and crosses that river to-night or to-morrow, does infinitely more in my estimation."

Her father smiled, but evidently his appetite was flagging also, and he soon went out to send
and receive some cipher despatches.

Merwyn was growing hungry for some evidence of greater friendliness than he had yet received.
Hitherto, he had never seen Marian alone when calling, and the thought had occurred that if
he braved the storm in paying her a visit, the effort might be appreciated. One part of his
hope was fulfilled, for he found her drawing-room empty. While he waited, that other stormy
and memorable evening when he had sought to find her alone flashed on his memory, and he feared
that he had made a false step in coming.

This impression was confirmed by her pale face and distant greeting. In vain he put forth his
best efforts to interest her. She remained coldly polite, took but a languid part in the conversation,
and at times even permitted him to see that her thoughts were preoccupied. He had been humble
and patient a long time, and now, in spite of himself, his anger began to rise.

Feeling that he had better take his leave while still under self-control, and proposing also
to hint that she had failed somewhat in courtesy, he arose abruptly and said: "You are not
well this evening, Miss Vosburgh? I should have perceived the fact earlier. I wish you good-night."

She felt the slight sting of his words, and was in no mood to endure it. Moreover, if she had
failed in such courtesy as he had a right to expect, he should know the reason, and she felt
at the moment willing that he should receive the implied reproach.

Therefore she said: "Pardon me, I am quite well. It is natural that I should be a little distraite,
for I have learned that my friends are exposed to this storm, and will probably engage in another
terrible battle to-morrow, or soon."

Again the old desperate expression, that she remembered so well, came into his eyes as he exclaimed,
bitterly: "You think me a coward because I remain in the city? What is this storm, or that
battle, compared with what I am facing! Good-night;" and, giving her no chance for further
words, he hastened away.

CHAPTER XXI.

FEARS AND PERPLEXITIES.

MERWYN found the storm so congenial to his mood that he breasted it for hours before returning
to his home. There, in weariness and reaction, he sank into deep dejection.

"What is the use of anger?" he asked himself, as he renewed the dying fire in his room. "In
view of all the past, she has more cause for resentment than I, while it is a matter of indifference
to her whether I am angry or not. I might as well be incensed at ice because it is cold, and
she is ice to me. She has her standard and a circle of friends who come up to it. This I never
have done and never can do. Therefore she only tolerates me and is more than willing that I
should disappear below her horizon finally. I was a fool to speak the words I did to-night.
What can they mean to her when nothing is left for me, apparently, but a safe, luxurious life?
Such outbreaks can only seem hysterical or mere affectations, and there shall be no more of
them, let the provocation be what it may. Indeed, why should I inflict myself on her any more?
I cannot say that she has not a woman's heart, but I wronged and chilled it from the first,
and cannot now retrieve myself. If I should go to her to-morrow, even in a private's uniform,
she would give me her hand cordially, but she compares me with hundreds of thousands who seem
braver men than I. It is useless for me to suggest that I am doing more than those who go to
fight. Her thought would be: 'I have all the friends I need among more knightly spirits who
are not afraid to look brave enemies in the face, and without whom the North would be disgraced.
Let graybeards furnish the sinews of war; let young men give their blood if need be. It is
indeed strange that a man's arm should be paralyzed, and his best hope in life blighted, by
a mother!'"

If he could have known Marian's thoughts and heard the conversation that ensued with her father,
he would not have been so despondent.

When he left her so abruptly she again experienced the compunctions she had felt before. Whether
he deserved it or not she could not shut her eyes to the severity of the wound inflicted, or
to his suffering. In vain she tried to assure herself that he did deserve it. Granting this,
the thoughts asserted themselves: "Why am I called upon to resent his course? Having granted
his request to visit me, I might, at least, be polite and affable on his own terms.  Because
he wishes more, and perhaps hopes for more, this does not, as papa says, commit me in the least.
He may have some scruple in fighting openly against the land of his mother's ancestry. If that
scruple has more weight with him than my friendly regard, that is his affair. His words to-night
indicated that he must be under some strong restraint. O dear! I wish I had never known him;
he perplexes and worries me. The course of my other friends is simple and straightforward as
the light. Why do I say other friends? He's not a friend at all, yet my thoughts return to
him in a way that is annoying."

When her father came home she told him what had occurred, and unconsciously permitted him to
see that her mind was disturbed. He did not smile quizzically, as some sagacious people would
have done, thus touching the young girl's pride and arraying it against her own best interests,
it might be. With the thought of her happiness ever uppermost, he would discover the secret
causes of her unwonted perturbation. Not only Merwyn--about whom he had satisfied himself--should
have his chance, but also the girl herself. Mrs. Vosburgh's conventional match-making would
leave no chance for either. The profounder man believed that nature, unless interfered with
by heavy, unskilful hands, would settle the question rightly.

He therefore listened without comment, and at first only remarked, "Evidently, Marian, you
are not trying to make the most and best of this young fellow."

"But, papa, am I bound to do this for people who are disagreeable to me and who don't meet
my views at all?"

"Certainly not. Indeed, you may have frozen Merwyn out of the list of your acquaintances already."

"Well," replied the girl, almost petulantly, "that, perhaps, will be the best ending of the
whole affair."

"That's for you to decide, my dear."

"But, papa, I FEEL that you don't approve of my course."

"Neither do I disapprove of it. I only say, according to our bond to be frank, that you are
unfair to Merwyn. Of course, if he is essentially disagreeable to you, there is no occasion
for you to make a martyr of yourself."

"That's what irritates me so," said the girl, impetuously. "He might have made himself very
agreeable. But he undervalued and misunderstood me so greatly from the first that it was hard
to forgive him."

"If he hadn't shown deep contrition and regret for that course I shouldn't wish you to forgive
him, even though his antecedents had made anything better scarcely possible."

"Come down to the present hour, then. What he asked of you is one thing. I see what he wishes.
He desires, at least, the friendship that I give to those who fulfil my ideal of manhood in
these times. He has no right to seek this without meeting the conditions which remove all hesitation
in regard to others. It angers me that he does so. I feel as if he were seeking to buy my good-will
by donations to this, that, and the other thing. He still misunderstands me. Why can't he realize
that, to one of my nature, fording the icy Rappahannock to-night would count for more than
his writing checks for millions?"

"Probably he does understand it, and that is what he meant by his words to-night, when he said,
'What is this storm, or what a battle?'"

She was overwrought, excited, and off her guard, and spoke from a deep impulse. "A woman, in
giving herself, gives everything. If he can't give up a scruple--I mean if his loyalty is so
slight that his mother's wishes and dead ancestors--"

"My dear little girl, you are not under the slightest obligation to give anything," resumed
her father, discreetly oblivious to the significance of her words. "If you care to give a little
good-will and kindness to one whom you have granted the right to visit you, they will tend
to confirm and develop the better and manly qualities he is now manifesting. You know I have
peculiar faculties of finding out about people, and, incidentally and casually, I have informed
myself about this Mr. Merwyn. I think I can truly say that he is doing all and more than could
be expected of a young fellow in his circumstances, with the one exception that he does not
put on our uniform and go to the front. He may have reasons--very possibly, as you think, mistaken
and inadequate ones--which, nevertheless, are binding on his conscience. What else could his
words mean to-night? He is not living a life of pleasure-seeking and dissipation, like so many
other young nabobs in the city. Apparently he has not sought much other society than yours.
Pardon me for saying it, but you have not given him much encouragement to avoid the temptations
that are likely to assail a lonely, irresponsible young fellow. In one sense you are under
no obligation to do this; in another, perhaps you are, for you must face the fact that you
have great influence over him.  This influence you must either use or throw away, as you decide.
You are not responsible for this influence; neither are your friends responsible for the war.
When it came, however, they faced the disagreeable and dangerous duties that it brought."

"O papa! I have been a stupid, resentful fool."

"No, my dear; at the worst you have been misled by generous and loyal impulses. Your deep sympathy
with recent events has made you morbid, and therefore unfair. To your mind Mr. Merwyn represented
the half-hearted element that shuns meeting what must be met at every cost. If this were true
of him I should share in your spirit, but he appears to be trying to be loyal and to do what
he can in the face of obstacles greater than many overcome."

"I don't believe he will ever come near me again!" she exclaimed.

"Then you are absolved in the future. Of course we can make no advances towards a man who has
been your suitor."

Merwyn's course promised to fulfil her fear,--she now acknowledged to herself that it was a
fear,--for his visits ceased. She tried to dismiss him from her thoughts, but a sense of her
unfairness and harshness haunted her. She did not see why she had not taken her father's view,
or why she had thrown away her influence that accorded with the scheme of life to which she
had pledged herself. The very restraint indicated by his words was a mystery, and mysteries
are fascinating. She remembered, with compunction, that not even his own mother had sought
to develop a true, manly spirit in him. "Now he is saying," she thought, bitterly, "that I,
too, am a fanatic,--worse than his mother."

Weeks passed and she heard nothing from him, nor did her father mention his name. While her
regret was distinct and positive, it must not be supposed that it gave her serious trouble.
Indeed, the letters of Mr. Lane, and the semi-humorous journal of Strahan and Blauvelt, together
with the general claims of society and her interest in her father's deep anxieties, were fast
banishing it from her mind, when, to her surprise, his card was handed to her one stormy afternoon,
late in January.

"I am sorry to intrude upon you, Miss Vosburgh," he began, as she appeared, "but--"

"Why should you regard it as an intrusion, Mr. Merwyn?"

"I think a lady has a right to regard any unwelcome society as an intrusion."

"Admitting even so much, it does not follow that this is an intrusion," she said, laughing.
Then she added, with slightly heightened color: "Mr. Merwyn, I must at least keep my own self-respect,
and this requires an acknowledgment. I was rude to you when you last called. But I was morbid
from anxiety and worry over what was happening. I had no right to grant your request to call
upon me and then fail in courtesy."

"Will you, then, permit me to renew my old request?" he asked, with an eagerness that he could
not disguise.

"Certainly not. That would imply such utter failure on my part! You should be able to forgive
me one slip, remembering the circumstances."

"You have the most to forgive," he replied, humbly. "I asked for little more than toleration,
but I felt that I had not the right to force even this upon you."

"I am glad you are inclined to be magnanimous," she replied, laughing. "Women usually take
advantage of that trait in men--when they manifest it. We'll draw a line through the evening
of the 20th of December, and, as Jefferson says, in his superb impersonation of poor old Rip,
'It don't count.' By the way, have you seen him?" she asked, determined that the conversation
should take a different channel.

"No; I have been busy of late. But pardon me, Miss Vosburgh, I'm forgetting my errand shamefully.
Do not take the matter too seriously. I think you have no reason to do so. Mr. Strahan is in
the city and is ill. I have just come from him."

Her face paled instantly, and she sank into a chair.

"I beg of you not to be so alarmed," he added, hastily. "I shall not conceal anything from
you. By the merest chance I saw him coming up Broadway in a carriage, and, observing that he
looked ill, jumped into a hack and followed him to his residence. You had reason for your anxiety
on December 20th, for he took a severe cold from exposure that night. For a time he made light
of it, but at last obtained sick-leave. He asked me to tell you--"

"He has scarcely mentioned the fact that he was not well;" and there was an accent of reproach
in the young girl's tones.

"I understand Strahan better than I once did, perhaps because better able to understand him,"
was Merwyn's quiet reply. "He is a brave, generous fellow, and, no doubt, wished to save you
from anxiety. There has been no chance for him to say very much to me."

"Was he expected by his family?"

"They were merely informed, by a telegram, that he was on his way. He is not so well as when
he started. Naturally he is worse for the journey. Moreover, he used these words, 'I felt that
I was going to be ill and wished to get home.'"

"Has a physician seen him yet?"

"Yes, I brought their family physician in the hack, which I had kept waiting. He fears that
it will be some time before his patient is out again. I have never been seriously ill myself,
but I am sure--I mean, I have heard--that a few words often have great influence in aiding
one in Strahan's condition to triumph over disease. It is often a question of will and courage,
you know. I will take a note to him if you wish. Poor fellow! he may have his biggest fight
on hand while the others are resting in winter quarters."

"I shall be only too glad to avail myself of your offer. Please excuse me a moment."

When she returned he saw traces of tears in her eyes. She asked, eagerly, "Will you see him often?"

"I shall call daily."

"Would it be too much trouble for you to let me know how he is, should he be very seriously
ill?" Then, remembering that this might lead to calls more frequent than she was ready to receive,
or than he would find it convenient to make, she added: "I suppose you are often down town
and might leave word with papa at his office. I have merely a formal acquaintance with Mrs.
Strahan and her daughters, and, if Mr. Strahan should be very ill, I should have to rely upon
you for information."

"I shall make sure that you learn of his welfare daily until he is able to write to you, and
I esteem it a privilege to render you this service."

He then bowed and turned away, and she did not detain him. Indeed, her mind was so absorbed
by her friend's danger that she could not think of much else.

The next day a note, addressed to Mr. Vosburgh, was left at his office, giving fuller particulars
of Strahan's illness, which threatened to be very serious indeed. High fever had been developed,
and the young soldier had lost all intelligent consciousness. Days followed in which this fever
was running its course, and Merwyn's reports, ominous in spite of all effort to disguise the
deep anxiety felt by Strahan's friends, were made only through Mr. Vosburgh. Marian began to
regret her suggestion that the information should come in this way, for she now felt that Merwyn
had received the impression that his presence would not be agreeable. She was eager for more
details and oppressed with the foreboding that she would never see her light-hearted friend
again. She was almost tempted to ask Merwyn to call, but felt a strange reluctance to do so.

"I gave him sufficient encouragement to continue his visits," she thought, "and he should distinguish
between the necessity of coming every day and the privilege of coming occasionally."

One evening her father looked very grave as he handed Marian the note addressed to him.

"O papa!" exclaimed the girl, "he's worse!"

"Yes, I fear Strahan is in a very critical condition. I happened to meet Merwyn when he left
the note to-day, and the young fellow himself looked haggard and ill. But he carelessly assured
me that he was perfectly well. He said that the crisis of Strahan's fever was approaching,
and that the indications were bad."

"Papa!" cried the girl, tearfully, "I can't endure this suspense and inaction. Why would it
be bad taste for us to call on Mrs. Strahan this evening? She must know how dear a friend Arthur
is to me. I don't care for conventionality in a case like this. It seems cold-blooded to show
no apparent interest, and it might do Arthur good if he should learn that we had been there
because of our anxiety and sympathy."

"Well, my dear, what you suggest is the natural and loyal course, and therefore outweighs all
conventionality in my mind. We'll go after dinner."

Marian's doubt as to her reception by Mrs. Strahan was speedily dispelled, for the sorrow-stricken
mother was almost affectionate in her welcome.

"Arthur, in his delirium, often mentions your name," she said, "and then he is in camp or battle
again, or else writing his journal. I have thought of sending for you, but he wouldn't have
known you. He does not even recognize me, and has not for days. Our physician commands absolute
quiet and as little change in those about him as possible. What we should have done without
Mr. Merwyn I scarcely know. He is with him now, and has watched every night since Arthur's
return. I never saw any one so changed, or else we didn't understand him. He is tireless in
his strength, and womanly in his patience. His vigils are beginning to tell on him sadly, but
he says that he will not give up till the crisis is past. If Arthur lives he will owe his life
largely to one who, last summer, appeared too indolent to think of anything but his own pleasure.
How we often misjudge people! They were boys and playmates together, and are both greatly changed.
O Miss Vosburgh, my heart just stands still with dread when I think of what may soon happen.
Arthur had become so manly, and we were so proud of him! He has written me more than once of
your influence, and I had hoped that the way might open for our better acquaintance."

"Do you think the crisis may come to-night?" Marian asked, with quivering lips.

"Yes, it may come now at any hour. The physician will remain all night."

"Oh, I wish I might know early in the morning. Believe me, I shall not sleep."

"You shall know, Miss Vosburgh, and I hope you will come and see me, whatever happens. You
will please excuse me now, for I cannot be away from Arthur at this time. I would not have
seen any one but you."

At one o'clock in the morning there was a ring at Mr. Vosburgh's door. He opened it, and Merwyn
stood there wrapped in his fur cloak.  "Will you please give this note to Miss Vosburgh?" he
said. "I think it contains words that will bring welcome relief and hope. I would not have
disturbed you at this hour had I not seen your light burning;" and, before Mr. Vosburgh could
reply, he lifted his hat and strode away.

The note ran as follows:

"MY DEAR MISS VOSBURGH:--Arthur became conscious a little before twelve. He was fearfully weak,
and for a time his life appeared to flicker. I alone was permitted to be with him. After a
while I whispered that you had been here. He smiled and soon fell into a quiet sleep. Our physician
now gives us strong hopes.

"Sincerely and gratefully yours,

"CHARLOTTE STRAHAN."

Marian, who had been sleepless from thoughts more evenly divided between her friend and Merwyn
than she would have admitted even to herself, handed the note to her father. Her face indicated
both gladness and perplexity. He read and returned it with a smile.

"Papa," she said, "you have a man's straightforward common-sense. I am only a little half-girl
and half-woman. Do you know, I almost fear that both Mrs. Strahan and Mr. Merwyn believe I
am virtually engaged to Arthur."

"Their belief can't engage you," said her father, laughing. "Young Strahan will get well, thanks
to you and Merwyn. Mrs. Strahan said that both were greatly changed. Merwyn certainly must
have a hardy nature, for he improves under a steady frost."

"Papa!" cried Marian, with a vivid blush, "you are a deeper and more dangerous ally of Mr.
Menvyn than mamma. I am on my guard against you both, and I shall retire at once before you
begin a panegyric that will cease only when you find I am asleep."

"Yes, my dear, go and sleep the sleep of the unjust!"

CHAPTER XXII.

A GIRL'S THOUGHTS AND IMPULSES.

SLEEP, which Marian said would cut short her father's threatened panegyrics of Merwyn, did
not come speedily. The young girl had too much food for thought.

She knew that Mrs. Strahan had not, during the past summer, misunderstood her son's faithful
nurse. In spite of all prejudice and resentment, in spite of the annoying fact that he would
intrude so often upon her thoughts, she had to admit the truth that he was greatly changed,
and that, while she might be the cause, she could take to herself no credit for the transformation.
To others she had given sincere and cordial encouragement. Towards him she had been harsh and
frigid. He must indeed possess a hardy nature, or else a cold persistence that almost made
her shiver, it was so indomitable.

She felt that she did not understand him; and she both shrunk from his character and was fascinated
by it. She could not now charge him with disregard of her feelings and lack of delicacy. His
visits had ceased when he believed them to be utterly repugnant; he had not availed himself
of the opportunity to see her often afforded by Strahan's illness, and had been quick to take
the hint that he could send his reports to her father. There had been no effort to make her
aware of his self-sacrificing devotion to her friend. The thing that was irritating her was
that he could approach so nearly to her standard and yet fail in a point that to her was vital.
His course indicated unknown characteristics or circumstances, and she felt that she could
never give him her confidence and unreserved regard while he fell short of the test of manhood
which she believed that the times demanded. If underneath all his apparent changes for the
better there was an innate lack of courage to meet danger and hardship, or else a cold, calculating
purpose not to take these risks, she would shrink from him in strong repulsion. She knew that
the war had developed not a few constitutional cowards,--men to be pitied, it is true, but
with a commiseration that, in her case, would be mingled with contempt. On the other hand,
if he reasoned, "I will win her if I can; I will do all and more than she can ask, but I will
not risk the loss of a lifetime's enjoyment of my wealth," she would quietly say to him by
her manner: "Enjoy your wealth. I can have no part in such a scheme of existence; I will not
give my hand, even in friendship, to a man who would do less than I would, were I in his place."

If her father was right, and he had scruples of conscience, or some other unknown restraint,
she felt that she must know all before she would give her trust and more. If he could not satisfy
her on these points, as others had done so freely and spontaneously, he had no right to ask
or expect more from her than ordinary courtesy.

Having thus resolutely considered antidotes for a tendency towards relentings not at all to
her mind, and met, as she believed, her father's charge of unfairness, her thoughts, full of
sympathy and hope, dwelt upon the condition of her friend. Recalling the past and the present,
her heart grew very tender, and she found that he occupied in it a foremost place. Indeed,
it seemed to her a species of disloyalty to permit any one to approach his place and that of
Mr. Lane, for both formed an inseparable part of her new and more earnest life.

She, too, had changed, and was changing. As her nature deepened and grew stronger it was susceptible
of deeper and stronger influences. Under the old regime pleasure, excitement, triumphs of power
that ministered to vanity, had been her superficial motives. To the degree that she had now
attained true womanhood, the influences that act upon and control a woman were in the ascendant.
Love ceased to dwell in her mind as a mere fastidious preference, nor could marriage ever be
a calculating choice, made with the view of securing the greatest advantages. She knew that
earnest men loved her without a thought of calculation,--loved her for herself alone.  She
called them friends now, and to her they were no more as yet.  But their downright sincerity
made her sincere and thoughtful. Her esteem and affection for them were so great that she was
not at all certain that circumstances and fuller acquaintance might not develop her regard
towards one or the other of them into a far deeper feeling. In their absence, their manly qualities
appealed to her imagination. She had reached a stage in spiritual development where her woman's
nature was ready for its supreme requirement. She could be more than friend, and was conscious
of the truth; and she believed that her heart would make a positive and final choice in accord
with her intense and loyal sympathies. In the great drama of the war centred all that ideal
and knightly action that has ever been so fascinating to her sex, and daily conversation with
her father had enabled her to understand what lofty principles and great destinies were involved.
She had been shown how President Lincoln's proclamation, freeing the slaves, had aimed a fatal
blow at the chief enemies of liberty, not only in this land, but in all lands.  Mr. Vosburgh
was a philosophical student of history, and, now that she had become his companion, he made
it clear to her how the present was linked to the past. Instead of being imbued with vindictiveness
towards the South, she was made to see a brave, self-sacrificing, but misled people, seeking
to rivet their own chains and blight the future of their fair land. Therefore, a man like Lane,
capable of appreciating and acting upon these truths, took heroic proportions in her fancy,
while Strahan, almost as delicate as a girl, yet brave as the best, won, in his straightforward
simplicity, her deepest sympathy. The fact that the latter was near, that his heart had turned
to her even from under the shadow of death, gave him an ascendency for the time.

"To some such man I shall eventually yield," she assured herself, "and not to one who brings
a chill of doubt, not to one unmastered by loyal impulses to face every danger which our enemies
dare meet."

Then she slept, and dreamt that she saw Strahan reaching out his hands to her for help from
dark, unknown depths.

She awoke sobbing, and, under the confused impulse of the moment, exclaimed: "He shall have
all the help I can give; he shall live. While he is weaker, he is braver than Mr. Lane. He
triumphed over himself and everything. He most needs me. Mr. Lane is strong in himself. Why
should I be raising such lofty standards of self-sacrifice when I cannot give love to one who
most needs it, most deserves it?"

CHAPTER XXIII.

"MY FRIENDSHIP IS MINE TO GIVE."

STRAHAN'S convalescence need not be dwelt upon, nor the subtle aid given by Marian through
flowers, fruit, and occasional calls upon his mother.

These little kindnesses were tonics beyond the physician's skill, and he grew stronger daily.
Mrs. Strahan believed that things were taking their natural course, and, with the delicacy
of a lady, was content to welcome the young girl in a quiet, cordial manner. Merwyn tacitly
accepted the mother's view, which she had not wholly concealed in the sick-room, and which
he thought had been confirmed by Marian's manner and interest. With returning health Strahan's
old sense of humor revived, and he often smiled and sighed over the misapprehension. Had he
been fully aware of Marian's mood, he might have given his physician cause to look grave over
an apparent return of fever.

In the reticence and delicacy natural to all the actors in this little drama, thoughts were
unspoken, and events drifted on in accordance with the old relations. Merwyn's self-imposed
duties of nurse became lighter, and he took much-needed rest. Strahan felt for him the strongest
good-will and gratitude, but grew more and more puzzled about him. Apparently the convalescent
was absolutely frank concerning himself. He spoke of his esteem and regard for Marian as he
always had done; his deeper affection he never breathed to any one, although he believed the
young girl was aware of it, and he did not in the least blame her that she had no power to
give him more than friendship.

Of his military plans and hopes he spoke without reserve to Merwyn, but in return received
little confidence. He could not doubt the faithful attendant who had virtually twice saved
his life, but he soon found a barrier of impenetrable reserve, which did not yield to any manifestations
of friendliness. Strahan at last came to believe that it veiled a deep, yet hopeless regard
for Marian. This view, however, scarcely explained the situation, for he found his friend even
more reticent in respect to the motives which kept him a civilian.

"I'd give six months' pay," said the young officer, on one occasion, "if we had you in our
regiment, and I am satisfied that I could obtain a commission for you. You would be sure of
rapid promotion. Indeed, with your wealth and influence you could secure a lieutenant-colonelcy
in a new regiment by spring. Believe me, Merwyn, the place for us young fellows is at the front
in these times. My blood's up,--what little I have left,--and I'm bound to see the scrimmage
out. You have just the qualities to make a good officer. You could control and discipline men
without bluster or undue harshness. We need such officers, for an awful lot of cads have obtained
commissions."

Merwyn had walked to a window so that his friend could not see his face, and at last he replied,
quietly and almost coldly: "There are some things, Strahan, in respect to which one cannot
judge for another. I am as loyal as you are now, but I must aid the cause in my own way. I
would prefer that you should not say anything more on this subject, for it is of no use. I
have taken my course, and shall reveal it only by my action. There is one thing that I can
do, and shall be very glad to do. I trust we are such good friends that you can accept of my
offer. Your regiment has been depleted. New men would render it more effective and add to your
chances of promotion.  It will be some time before you are fit for active service. I can put
you in the way of doing more than your brother-officers in the regiment, even though you are
as pale as a ghost. Open a recruiting office near your country home again,--you can act at
present through a sergeant,--and I will give you a check which will enable you to add to the
government bounty so largely that you can soon get a lot of hardy country fellows. No one need
know where the money comes from except ourselves."

Strahan laughed, and said: "It is useless for me to affect squeamishness in accepting favors
from you at this late day. I believed you saved my life last summer, and now you are almost
as haggard as I am from watching over me. I'll take your offer in good faith, as I believe
you mean it. I won't pose as a self-sacrificing patriot only. I confess that I am ambitious.
You fellows used to call me 'little Strahan.' YOU are all right now, but there are some who
smile yet when my name is mentioned, and who regard my shoulder-straps as a joke. I've no doubt
they are already laughing at the inglorious end of my military career. I propose to prove that
I can be a soldier as well as some bigger and more bewhiskered men.  I have other motives also;"
and his thought was, "Marian may feel differently if I can win a colonel's eagles."

Merwyn surmised as much, but he only said, quietly: "Your motives are as good as most men's,
and you have proved yourself a brave, efficient officer. That would be enough for me, had I
not other motives also."

"Hang it all! I would tell you my motives if you would be equally frank."

"Since I cannot be, you must permit me to give other proofs of friendship. Nor do I expect,
indeed I should be embarrassed by receiving, what I cannot return."

"You're an odd fish, Merwyn. Well, I have ample reason to give you my faith and loyalty, as
I do. Your proposition has put new life into me already. I needn't spend idle weeks--"

"Hold on. One stipulation. Your physician must regulate all your actions. Remember that here,
as at the front, the physician is, at times, autocrat."

Mervvyn called twice on Marian during his friend's convalescence, and could no longer complain
of any lack of politeness. Indeed, her courtesy was slightly tinged with cordiality, and she
took occasion to speak of her appreciation of his vigils at Strahan's side. Beyond this she
showed no disposition towards friendliness. At the same, time, she could not even pretend to
herself that she was indifferent. He piqued both her pride and her curiosity, for he made no
further effort to reveal himself or to secure greater favor than she voluntarily bestowed.
She believed that her father looked upon her course as an instance of feminine prejudice, of
resentment prolonged unnaturally and capriciously,--that he was saying to himself, "A man would
quarrel and have done with it after amends were made, but a woman--"

"He regards this as my flaw, my weakness, wherein I differ from him and his kind," she thought.
"I can't help it. Circumstances have rendered it impossible for me to feel toward Mr. Merwyn
as toward other men. I have thought the matter out and have taken my stand. If he wishes more
than I now give he must come up to my ground, for I shall not go down to his."

She misunderstood her father. That sagacious gentleman said nothing, and quietly awaited developments.

It was a glad day for Arthur Strahan when, wrapped and muffled beyond all danger, he was driven,
in a close carriage, to make an afternoon visit to Marian. She greeted him with a kindness
that warmed his very soul, and even inspired hopes which he had, as yet, scarcely dared to
entertain. Time sped by with all the old easy interchange of half-earnest nonsense. A deep
chord of truth and affection vibrated through even jest and merry repartee. Yet, so profound
are woman's intuitions in respect to some things, that, now she was face to face with him again,
she feared, before an hour passed, that he could never be more to her than when she had given
him loyal friendship in the vine-covered cottage in the country.

"By the way," he remarked, abruptly, "I suppose you never punished Merwyn as we both, at one
time, felt that he deserved? He admits that he calls upon you quite frequently, and speaks
of you in terms of strongest respect. You know I am his sincere, grateful friend henceforth.
I don't pretend to understand him, but I trust him, and wish him well from the depths of my heart."

"I also wish him well," Marian remarked, quietly.

He looked at her doubtfully for a moment, then said, "Well, I suppose you have reasons for
resentment, but I assure you he has changed very greatly."

"How do you know that, when you don't understand him?"

"I do know it," said the young fellow, earnestly. "Merwyn never was like other people. He is
marked by ancestry; strong-willed, reticent on one side, proud and passionate on the other.
My own mother was not more untiring and gentle with me than he, yet if I try to penetrate his
reserve he becomes at once distant, and almost cold.  When I thought he was seeking to amuse
himself with you I felt like strangling him; now that I know he has a sincere respect for you,
if not more, I have nothing against him. I wish he would join us in the field, and have said
as much to him more than once. He has the means to raise a regiment himself, and there are
few possessing more natural ability to transform raw recruits into soldiers."

"Why does he not join you in the field?" she asked, quickly, and there was a trace of indignation
in her tones.

"I do not think he will ever speak of his reasons to any one. At least, he will not to me."

"Very well," she said; and there was significance in her cold, quiet tones.

"They result from no lack of loyalty," earnestly resumed Strahan, who felt that for some reason
he was not succeeding as his friend's advocate. "He has generously increased my chances of
promotion by giving me a large sum towards recruiting my regiment."

"After your hard experience, are you fully determined to go back?" she asked, with a brilliant
smile. "Surely you have proved your courage, and, with your impaired health, you have a good
reason not for leaving the task to stronger men."

"And take my place contentedly among the weaker ones in your estimation?" he added, flushing.
"How could you suggest or think such a thing? Certainly I shall go back as soon as my physician
permits, and I shall go to stay till the end, unless I am knocked over or disabled."

Her eyes flashed exultantly as she came swiftly to him. "Now you can understand me," she said,
giving him her hand. "My friendship and honor are for men like you and Mr. Lane and Mr. Blauvelt,
who offer all, and not for those who offer--MONEY."

"By Jove, Miss Marian, you make me feel as if I could storm Richmond single-handed."

"Don't think I say this in any callous disregard of what may happen. God knows I do not; but
in times like these my heart chooses friends among knightly men who voluntarily go to meet
other men as brave. Don't let us talk any more about Mr. Merwyn. I shall always treat him politely,
and I have gratefully acknowledged my indebtedness for his care of you. He understands me,
and will give me no opportunity to do as you suggested, were I so inclined. His conversation
is that of a cultivated man, and as such I enjoy it; but there it all ends."

"But I don't feel that I have helped my friend in your good graces at all," protested Strahan,
ruefully.

"Has he commissioned you to help him?" she asked, quickly.

"No, no, indeed. You don't know Merwyn, or you never would have asked that question."

"Well, I prefer as friends those whom I do know, who are not inshrouded in mystery or incased
in reticence. No, Arthur Strahan, my friendship is mine to give, be it worth much or little.
If he does not care enough for it to take the necessary risks, when the bare thought of shunning
them makes you flush hotly, he cannot have it. All his wealth could not buy one smile from
me. Now let all this end. I respect your loyalty to him, but I have my own standard, and shall
abide by it;" and she introduced another topic.

CHAPTER XXIV.

A FATHER'S FORETHOUGHT.

STRAHAN improved rapidly in health, and was soon able to divide his time between his city and
his country home. The recruiting station near the latter place was successful in securing stalwart
men, who were tempted by the unusually large bounties offered through Merwyn's gift. The young
officer lost no opportunities of visiting Marian's drawing-room, and, while his welcome continued
as cordial as ever, she, nevertheless, indicated by a frank and almost sisterly manner the
true state of her feelings toward him. The impulse arising at the critical hour of his illness
speedily died away. His renewed society confirmed friendship, but awakened nothing more, and
quieter thoughts convinced her that the future must reveal what her relations should be to
him and to others.

As he recovered health her stronger sympathy went out to Mr. Lane, who had not asked for leave
of absence.

"I am rampantly well," he wrote, "and while my heart often travels northward, I can find no
plausible pretext to follow. I may receive a wound before long which will give me a good excuse,
since, for our regiment, there is prospect of much active service while the infantry remain
in winter quarters. It is a sad truth that the army is discouraged and depleted to a degree
never known before. Homesickness is epidemic. A man shot himself the other day because refused
a furlough. Desertions have been fearfully numerous among enlisted men, and officers have urged
every possible excuse for leaves of absence. A man with my appetite stands no chance whatever,
and our regimental surgeon laughs when I assure him that I am suffering from acute heart-disease.
Therefore, my only hope is a wound, and I welcome our prospective raid in exchange for dreary
picket duty."

Marian knew what picket duty and raiding meant in February weather, and wrote words of kindly
warmth that sustained her friend through hard, prosaic service.

She also saw that her father was burdened with heavy cares and responsibilities. Disloyal forces
and counsels were increasing in the great centres at the North, and especially in New York
City. Therefore he was intrusted with duties of the most delicate and difficult nature. It
was her constant effort to lead him to forget his anxieties during such evenings as he spent
at home, and when she had congenial callers she sometimes prevailed upon him to take part in
the general conversation. It so happened, one evening, that Strahan and Merwyn were both present.
Seeing that the latter felt a little de trop, Mr. Vosburgh invited him to light a cigar in
the dining-room, and the two men were soon engaged in animated talk, the younger being able
to speak intelligently of the feeling in England at the time. By thoughtful questions he also
drew out his host in regard to affairs at home.

The two guests departed together, and Marian, observing the pleased expression on her father's
face, remarked, "You have evidently found a congenial spirit."

"I found a young fellow who had ideas and who was not averse to receiving more."

"You can relieve my conscience wholly, papa," said the young girl, laughing. "When Mr. Merwyn
comes hereafter I shall turn him over to you. He will then receive ideas and good influence
at their fountain-head. You and mamma are inclined to give him so much encouragement that I
must be more on the defensive than ever."

"That policy would suit me exactly," replied her father, with a significant little nod. "I
don't wish to lose you, and I'm more afraid of Merwyn than of all the rest together."

"More afraid of HIM!" exclaimed the girl, with widening eyes.

"Of him."

"Why?"

"Because you don't understand him."

"That's an excellent reason for keeping him at a distance."

"Reason, reason. What has reason to do with affairs of this kind?"

"Much, in my case, I assure you. Thank you for forewarning me so plainly."

"I've no dark designs against your peace."

Nevertheless, these half-jesting words foreshadowed the future, so far as Mr. Vosburgh and
Mr. Merwyn were concerned. Others were usually present when the latter called, and he always
seemed to enjoy a quiet talk with the elder man. Mrs. Vosburgh never failed in her cordiality,
or lost hope that his visits might yet lead to a result in accordance with her wishes. Marian
made much sport of their protege, as she called him, and, since she now treated him with the
same courtesy that other mere calling acquaintances received, the habit of often spending part
of the evening at the modest home grew upon him. Mr. Vosburgh soon discovered that the young
man was a student of American affairs and history. This fact led to occasional visits by the
young man to the host's library, which was rich in literature on these subjects.

On one stormy evening, which gave immunity from other callers, Marian joined them, and was
soon deeply interested herself. Suddenly becoming conscious of the fact, she bade them an abrupt
good-night and went to her room with a little frown on her brow.

"It's simply exasperating," she exclaimed, "to see a young fellow of his inches absorbed in
American antiquities when the honor and liberty of America are at stake. Then, at times, he
permits such an expression of sadness to come into his big black eyes! He is distant enough,
but I can read his very thoughts, and he thinks me obduracy itself. He will soon return to
his elegant home and proceed to be miserable in the most luxurious fashion. If he were riding
with Mr.  Lane, to-night, on a raid, he would soon distinguish between his cherished woe and
a soldier's hardships."

Nevertheless, she could do little more than maintain a mental protest at his course, in which
he persevered unobtrusively, yet unfalteringly. There was no trace of sentiment in his manner
toward her, nor the slightest conscious appeal for sympathy. His conversation was so intelligent,
and at times even brilliant, that she could not help being interested, and she observed that
he resolutely chose subjects of an impersonal character, shunning everything relating to himself.
She could not maintain any feeling approaching contempt, and the best intrenchment she could
find was an irritated perplexity. She could not deny that his face was growing strong in its
manly beauty. Although far paler and thinner than when she had first seen it, a heavy mustache
and large, dark, thoughtful eyes relieved it from the charge of effeminacy. Every act, and
even his tones, indicated high breeding, and she keenly appreciated such things. His reserve
was a stimulus to thought, and his isolated life was unique for one in his position, while
the fact that he sought her home and society with so little to encourage him was strong and
subtle homage. More than all, she thought she recognized a trait in him which rarely fails
to win respect,--an unfaltering will. Whatever his plans or purposes were, the impression grew
stronger in her mind that he would not change them.

"But I have a pride and a will equal to his," she assured herself. "He can come thus far and
no farther. Papa thinks I will yield eventually to his persistence and many fascinations. Were
this possible, no one should know it until he had proved himself the peer of the bravest and
best of my time."

Winter had passed, and spring brought not hope and gladness, but deepening dread as the hour
approached when the bloody struggle would be renewed. Mr. Lane had participated in more than
one cavalry expedition, but had received no wounds. Strahan was almost ready to return, and
had sent much good material to the thinned ranks of his regiment. His reward came promptly,
for at that late day men were most needed, and he who furnished them secured a leverage beyond
all political influence. The major in his regiment resigned from ill-health, and Strahan was
promoted to the vacancy at once. He received his commission before he started for the front,
and he brought it to Marian with almost boyish pride and exultation. He had called for Merwyn
on his way, and insisted on having his company. He found the young fellow nothing loath.

Merwyn scarcely entertained the shadow of a hope of anything more than that time would soften
Marian's feelings toward him. The war could not last forever. Unexpected circumstances might
arise, and a steadfast course must win a certain kind of respect. At any rate it was not in
his nature to falter, especially when her tolerance was parting with much of its old positiveness.
His presence undoubtedly had the sanction of her father and mother, and for the former he was
gaining an esteem and liking independent of his fortunes with the daughter. Love is a hardy
plant, and thrives on meagre sustenance. It was evident that the relations between Marian and
Strahan were not such as he had supposed during the latter's illness. Her respect and friendship
he would have, if it took a lifetime to acquire them.  He would not be balked in the chief
purpose of his life, or retreat from the pledge, although it was given in the agony of humiliation
and defeat. As long as he had reason to believe that her hand and heart were free, it was not
in human nature to abandon all hope.

On this particular evening Mr. Vosburgh admitted the young men, and Marian, hearing Strahan's
voice, called laughingly from the parlor: "You are just in time for the wedding. I should have
been engaged to any one except you."

"Engaged to any one except me? How cruel is my fate!"

"Pardon me," began Merwyn quickly, and taking his hat again; "I shall repeat my call at a time
more opportune."

Marian, who had now appeared, said, in polite tones: "Mr. Merwyn, stay by all means. I could
not think of separating two such friends. Our waitress has no relatives to whom she can go,
therefore we are giving her a wedding from our house."

"Then I am sure there is greater reason for my leave-taking at present. I am an utter stranger
to the bride, and feel that my presence would seem an intrusion to her, at least. Nothing at
this time should detract from her happiness. Good-evening."

Marian felt the force of his words, and was also compelled to recognize his delicate regard
for the feelings of one in humble station. She would have permitted him to depart, but Mr.
Vosburgh interposed quickly: "Wait a moment, Mr. Merwyn; I picked up a rare book, down town,
relating to the topic we were discussing the other evening. Suppose you go up to my library.
I'll join you there, for the ceremony will soon be over. Indeed, we are now expecting the groom,
his best man, and the minister. It so happens that the happy pair are Protestants, and so we
can have an informal wedding."

"Oh, stay, Merwyn," said Strahan. "It was I who brought you here, and I shouldn't feel that
the evening was complete without you."

The former looked doubtfully at Marian, who added, quickly: "You cannot refuse papa's invitation,
Mr. Merwyn, since it removes the only scruple you can have. It is, perhaps, natural that the
bride should wish to see only familiar faces at this time, and it was thoughtful of you to
remember this, but, as papa says, the affair will soon be over."

"And then," resumed Strahan, "I have a little pie to show you, Miss Marian, in which Merwyn
had a big finger."

"I thought that was an affair between ourselves," said Merwyn, throwing off his overcoat.

"Oh, do not for the world reveal any of Mr. Merwyn's secrets!" cried the girl.

"It is no secret at all to you, Miss Marian, nor did I ever intend that it should be one,"
Strahan explained.

"Mr. Merwyn, you labor under a disadvantage in your relations with Mr. Strahan. He has friends,
and friendship is not based on reticence."

"Therefore I can have no friends, is the inference, I suppose."

"That cannot be said while I live," began the young officer, warmly; but here a ring at the
door produced instant dispersion. "I suppose I can be present," Strahan whispered to Marian.
"Barney Ghegan is an older acquaintance of mine than of yours, and your pretty waitress has
condescended to smile graciously on me more than once, although my frequent presence at your
door must have taxed her patience."

"You have crossed her palm with too much silver, I fear, to make frowns possible. Silver, indeed!
when has any been seen? But money in any form is said to buy woman's smiles."

"Thank Heaven it doesn't buy yours."

"Hush! Your gravity must now be portentous."

The aggressive Barney, now a burly policeman, had again brought pretty Sally Maguire to terms,
and on this evening received the reward of his persistent wooing. After the ceremony and a
substantial supper, which Mrs. Vosburgh graced with her silver, the couple took their brief
wedding journey to their rooms, and Barney went on duty in the morning, looking as if all the
world were to his mind.

When Mr. Vosburgh went up to his library his step was at first unnoted, and he saw his guest
sitting before the fire, lost in a gloomy revery. When observed, he asked, a little abruptly:
"Is the matter to which Mr. Strahan referred a secret which you wish kept?"

"Oh, no! Not as far as I am concerned. What I have done is a bagatelle. I merely furnished
a little money for recruiting purposes."

"It is not a little thing to send a good man to the front, Mr. Merwyn."

"Nor is it a little thing not to go one's self," was the bitter reply. Then he added, hastily,
"I am eager to see the book to which you refer."

"Pardon me, Mr. Merwyn, your words plainly reveal your inclination. Would you not be happier
if you followed it?"

"I cannot, Mr. Vosburgh, nor can I explain further. Therefore, I must patiently submit to all
adverse judgment." The words were spoken quietly and almost wearily.

"I suppose that your reasons are good and satisfactory."

"They are neither good nor satisfactory," burst out the young man with sudden and vindictive
impetuosity. "They are the curse of my life. Pardon me. I am forgetting myself. I believe you
are friendly at least. Please let all this be as if it were not." Then, as if the possible
import of his utterance had flashed upon him, he drew himself up and said, coldly, "If, under
the circumstances, you feel I am unworthy of trust--"

"Mr. Merwyn," interrupted his host, "I am accustomed to deal with men and to be vigilantly
on my guard. My words led to what has passed between us, and it ends here and now. I would
not give you my hand did I not trust you. Come, here is the book;" and he led the way to a
conversation relating to it.

Merwyn did his best to show a natural interest in the subject, but it was evident that a tumult
had been raised in his mind difficult to control. At last he said: "May I take the book home?
I will return it after careful reading."

Mr. Vosburgh accompanied him to the drawing-room, and Marian sportively introduced him to Major
Strahan.

For a few minutes he was the gayest and most brilliant member of the party, and then he took
his leave, the young girl remarking, "Since you have a book under your arm we cannot hope to
detain you, for I have observed that, with your true antiquarian, the longer people have been
dead the more interesting they become."

"That is perfectly natural," he replied, "for we can form all sorts of opinions about them,
and they can never prove that we are wrong."

"More's the pity, if we are wrong. Good-night."

"Order an extra chop, Merwyn, and I'll breakfast with you," cried Strahan. "I've only two days
more, you know."

"Well, papa," said Marian, joining him later in the library, "did you and Mr. Merwyn settle
the precise date when the Dutch took Holland?"

"'More's the pity, if we ARE wrong!' I have been applying your words to the living rather than
to the dead."

"To Mr. Merwyn, you mean."

"Yes."

"Has he been unbosoming himself to you?"

"Oh, no, indeed!"

"Why then has he so awakened your sympathy?"

"I fear he is facing more than any of your friends."

"And, possibly, fear is the reason."

"I do not think so."

"It appears strange to me, papa, that you are more ready to trust than I am. If there is nothing
which will not bear the light, why is he so reticent even to his friend?"

"I do not know the reasons for his course, nor am I sure that they would seem good ones to
me, but my knowledge of human nature is at fault if he is not trustworthy. I wish we did know
what burdens his mind and trammels his action. Since we do not I will admit, to-night, that
I am glad you feel toward him just as you do."

"Papa, you entertain doubts at last."

"No, I admit that something of importance is unknown and bids fair to remain so, but I cannot
help feeling that it is something for which he is not to blame. Nevertheless, I would have
you take no steps in the dark, were the whole city his."

"O papa! you regard this matter much too seriously. What steps had I proposed taking? How much
would it cost me to dispense with his society altogether?"

"I do not know how much it might cost you in the end."

"Well, you can easily put the question to the test."

"That I do not propose to do. I shall not act as if what may be a great misfortune was a fault.
Events will make everything clear some day, and if they clear him he will prove a friend whom
I, at least, shall value highly. He is an unusual character, one that interests me greatly,
whatever future developments may reveal. It would be easy for me to be careless or arbitrary,
as I fear many fathers are in these matters. I take you into my confidence and reveal to you
my thoughts. You say that your reason has much to do with this matter.  I take you at your
word. Suspend judgment in regard to Merwyn. Let him come and go as he has done. He will not
presume on such courtesy, nor do you in any wise commit yourself, even to the friendly regard
that you have for others. For your sake, Marian, for the chances which the future may bring,
I should be glad if your heart and hand were free when I learn the whole truth about this young
fellow. I am no match-maker in the vulgar acceptation of the word, but I, as well as you, have
a deep interest at stake. I have informed myself in regard to Mr. Merwyn, senior. The son appears
to have many of the former's traits. If he can never meet your standard or win your love that
ends the matter. But, in spite of everything, he interests you deeply, as well as myself; and
were he taking the same course as your friend who has just left, he would stand a better chance
than that friend. You see how frank I am, and how true to my promise to help you."

Marian came and leaned her arm on his shoulder as she looked thoughtfully into the glowing grate.

At last she said: "I am grateful for your frankness, papa, and understand your motives. Many
girls would not make the sad blunders they do had they such a counsellor as you, one who can
be frank without being blunt and unskilful. In respect to these subjects, even with a daughter,
there must be delicacy as well as precision of touch."

"There should also be downright common-sense, Marian, a recognition of tacts and tendencies,
of what is and what may be. On one side a false delicacy often seals the lips of those most
interested, until it is too late to speak; on the other, rank, wealth, and like advantages
are urged without any delicacy at all. These have their important place, but the qualities
which would make your happiness sure are intrinsic to the man. You know it is in my line to
disentangle many a snarl in human conduct. Look back on the past without prejudice, if you
can. Merwyn virtually said that he would make your standard of right and wrong his,--that he
would measure things as you estimate them, with that difference, of course, inherent in sex.
Is he not trying to do so? Is he not acting, with one exception, as you would wish? Here comes
in the one thing we don't understand. As you suggest, it may be a fatal flaw in the marble,
but we don't know this. The weight of evidence, in my mind, is against it. His course toward
Strahan--one whom he might easily regard as a rival--is significant. He gave him far more than
money; he drained his own vitality in seeking to restore his friend to health. A coarse, selfish
man always cuts a sorry figure in a sick-room, and shuns its trying duties even in spite of
the strongest obligations. You remember Mrs. Strahan's tribute to Merwyn. Yet there was no
parade of his vigils, nor did he seek to make capital out of them with you. Now I can view
all these things dispassionately, as a man, and, as I said before, they give evidence of an
unusual character. Apparently he has chosen a certain course, and he has the will-power to
carry it out. Your heart, your life, are still your own. All I wish is that you should not
bestow them so hastily as not to secure the best possible guaranties of happiness.  This young
man has crossed your path in a peculiar way. You have immense influence over him. So far as
he appears free to act you influence his action. Wait and see what it all means before you
come to any decision about him. Now," he concluded, smiling, "is my common-sense applied to
these affairs unnatural or unreasonable?"

"I certainly can wait with great equanimity," she replied, laughing, "and I admit the reasonableness
of what you say as you put it. Nor can I any longer affect any disguises with you. Mr. Merwyn
DOES interest me, and has retained a hold upon my thoughts which has annoyed me. He has angered
and perplexed me. It has seemed as if he said, 'I will give you so much for your regard; I
will not give, however, what you ask.' As you put it to-night, it is the same as if he said,
'I cannot.' Why can he not? The question opens unpleasant vistas to my mind. It will cost me
little, however, to do as you wish, and my curiosity will be on the qui vive, if nothing more."

CHAPTER XXV.

A CHAINED WILL.

IN due time Strahan departed, hopeful and eager to enter on the duties pertaining to his higher
rank. He felt that Marian's farewell had been more than she had ever given him any right to
expect. Her manner had ever been too frank and friendly to awaken delusive hopes, and, after
all, his regard for her was characterized more by boyish adoration than by the deep passion
of manhood. To his sanguine spirit the excitement of camp and the responsibilities of his new
position formed attractions which took all poignant regret from his leave-taking, and she was
glad to recognize this truth. She had failed signally to carry out her self-sacrificing impulse,
when he was so ill, to reward his heroism and supplement his life with her own; and she was
much relieved to find that he appeared satisfied with the friendship she gave, and that there
was no need of giving more. Indeed, he made it very clear that he was not a patriotic martyr
in returning to the front, and his accounts of army life had shown that the semi-humorous journal,
kept by himself and Blauvelt, was not altogether a generous effort to conceal from her a condition
of dreary duty, hardship, and danger. Life in the field has ever had its fascinations to the
masculine nature, and her friends were apparently finding an average enjoyment equal to her
own. She liked them all the better for this, since, to her mind, it proved that that the knightly
impulses of the past were unspent,--that, latent in the breasts of those who had seemed mere
society fellows, dwelt the old virile forces.

"I shall prove," she assured herself, proudly, "that since true men are the same now as when
they almost lived in armor, so ladies in their bowers have favors only for those to whom heroic
action is second nature."

Blauvelt had maintained the journal during Strahan's absence, doing more with pencil than pen,
and she had rewarded him abundantly by spicy little notes, full of cheer and appreciation.
She had no scruples in maintaining this correspondence, for in it she had her father's sanction,
and the letters were open to her parents' inspection when they cared to see them. Indeed, Mr.
and Mrs. Vosburgh enjoyed the journal almost as much as Marian herself.

After Strahan's departure, life was unusually quiet in the young girl's home. Her father was
busy, as usual, and at times anxious, for he was surrounded by elements hostile to the government.
Aware, however, that the army of the Potomac was being largely reinforced, that General Hooker
was reorganizing it with great success, and that he was infusing into it his own sanguine spirit,
Mr. Vosburgh grew hopeful that, with more genial skies and firmer roads, a blow would be struck
which would intimidate disloyalty at the North as well as in the South.

Marian shared in this hopefulness, although she dreaded to think how much this blow might cost
her, as well as tens of thousands of other anxious hearts.

At present her mind was at rest in regard to Mr. Lane, for he had written that his regiment
had returned from an expedition on which they had encountered little else than mud, sleet,
and rain. The prospects now were that some monotonous picket-duty in a region little exposed
to danger would be their chief service, and that they would be given time to rest and recruit.

This lull in the storm of war was Merwyn's opportunity. The inclement evenings often left Marian
unoccupied, and she divided her time between her mother's sitting-room and her father's library,
where she often found her quondam suitor, and not infrequently he spent an hour or two with
her in the parlor. In a certain sense she had accepted her father's suggestions. She was studying
the enigma with a lively curiosity, as she believed, and had to admit to herself that the puzzle
daily became more interesting. Merwyn pleased her fastidious taste and interested her mind,
and the possibilities suggested by her own and her father's words made him an object of peculiar
and personal interest. The very uniqueness of their relations increased her disposition to
think about him. It might be impossible that he should ever become even her friend; he might
become her husband. Her father's remark, "I don't know how much it might cost you to dismiss
him finally," had led to many questionings. Other young men she substantially understood. She
could gauge their value, influence, and attractiveness almost at once; but what possibilities
lurked in this reticent man who came so near her ideal, yet failed at a vital point? The wish,
the effort to understand him, gave an increasing zest to their interviews. He had asked her
to be his wife. She had understood him then, and had replied as she would again if he should
approach her in a similar spirit. Again, at any hour he would ask her hand if she gave him
sufficient encouragement, and she knew it. He would be humility itself in suing for the boon,
and she knew this also, yet she did not understand him at all. His secret fascinated her, yet
she feared it. It must be either some fatal flaw in his character, or else a powerful restraint
imposed from without. If it was the former she would shrink from him at once; if the latter,
it would indeed be a triumph, a proof of her power, to so influence him that he would make
her the first consideration in the world.

Every day, however, increased her determination to exert this influence only by firmly maintaining
her position. If he wished her friendship and an equal chance with others for more, he must
prove himself the equal of others in all respects. By no words would she ever now hint that
he should take their course; but she allowed herself to enhance his motives by permitting him
to see her often, and by an alluring yet elusive courtesy, of which she was a perfect mistress.

This period was one of mingled pain and pleasure to Merwyn. Remembering his interview with
Mr. Vosburgh, he felt that he had been treated with a degree of confidence that was even generous.
But he knew that from Mr. Vosburgh he did not receive full trust,--that there were certain
topics which each touched upon with restraint. Even with the father he was made to feel that
he had reached the limit of their friendly relations. They could advance no farther unless
the barrier of his reserve was broken down.

He believed that he was dissipating the prejudices of the daughter; that she was ceasing to
dislike him personally. He exerted every faculty of his mind to interest her; he studied her
tastes and views with careful analysis, that he might speak to her intelligently and acceptably.
The kindling light in her eyes, and her animated tones, often proved that he succeeded. Was
it the theme wholly that interested her? or was the speaker also gaining some place in her
thoughts? He never could be quite certain as to these points, and yet the impression was growing
stronger that if he came some day and said, quietly, "Good-by, Miss Vosburgh, I am going to
face every danger which any man dare meet," she would give him both hands in friendly warmth,
and that there would be an expression on her face which had never been turned towards him.

A stormy day, not far from the middle of April, ended in a stormier evening. Marian had not
been able to go out, and had suffered a little from ennui. Her mother had a headache, Mr. Vosburgh
had gone to keep an appointment, and the evening promised to be an interminable one to the
young girl. She unconsciously wished that Merwyn would come, and half-smilingly wondered whether
he would brave the storm to see her.

She was not kept long in suspense, for he soon appeared with a book which he wished to return,
he said.

"Papa is out," Marian began, affably, "and you will have to be content with seeing me. You
have a morbidly acute conscience, Mr. Merwyn, to return a book on a night like this."

"My conscience certainly is very troublesome."

Almost before she was aware of it the trite saying slipped out, "Honest confession is good
for the soul."

"To some souls it is denied, Miss Vosburgh;" and there was a trace of bitterness in his tones.
Then, with resolute promptness, he resumed their usual impersonal conversation.

While they talked, the desire to penetrate his secret grew strong upon the young girl. It was
almost certain that they would not be interrupted, and this knowledge led her to yield to her
mood. She felt a strange relenting towards him. A woman to her finger-tips, she could not constantly
face this embodied mystery without an increasing desire to solve it. Cold curiosity, however,
was not the chief inspiration of her impulse. The youth who sat on the opposite side of the
glowing grate had grown old by months as if they were years. His secret was evidently not only
a restraint, but a wearing burden. By leading her companion to reveal so much of his trouble
as would give opportunity for her womanly ministry, might she not, in a degree yet unequalled,
carry out her scheme of life to make the "most and best of those over whom she had influence"?

"Many brood over an infirmity, a fault, or an obligation till they grow morbid," she thought.
"I might not be able to show him what was best and right, but papa could if we only knew."

Therefore her words and tones were kinder than usual, and she made slight and delicate references
to herself, that he might be led to speak of himself. At last she hit upon domestic affairs
as a safe, natural ground of approach, and gave a humorous account of some of her recent efforts
to learn the mysteries of housekeeping, and she did not fail to observe his wistful and deeply-interested
expression.

Suddenly, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, she remarked: "I do not see how
you manage to keep house in that great, empty mansion of yours."

"You know, then, where I live?"

"Oh, yes. I saw you descend the steps of a house on Madison Avenue one morning last fall, and
supposed it was your home."

"You were undoubtedly right. I can tell you just how I manage, or rather, how everything IS
managed, for I have little to do with the matter. An old family servant looks after everything
and provides me with my meals. She makes out my daily menu according to her 'own will,' which
is 'sweet' if not crossed."

"Indeed! Are you so indifferent? I thought men gave much attention to their dinners."

"I do to mine, after it is provided. Were I fastidious, old Cynthy would give me no cause for
complaint. Then I have a man who looks after the fires and the horses, etc. I am too good a
republican to keep a valet. So you see that my domestic arrangements are simple in the extreme."

"And do those two people constitute your whole household?" she asked, wondering at a frankness
which seemed complete.

"Yes. The ghosts and I have the house practically to ourselves most of the time."

"Are there ghosts?" she asked, laughing, but with cheeks that began to burn in her kindling
interest.

"There are ghosts in every house where people have lived and died; that is, if you knew and
cared for the people. My father is with me very often!"

"Mr. Merwyn, I don't understand you!" she exclaimed, without trying to disguise her astonishment.
The conversation was so utterly unlike anything that had occurred between them before that
she wondered whither it was leading. "I fear you are growing morbid," she added.

"I hope not. Nor will you think so when I explain. Of course nothing like gross superstition
is in my mind. I remember my father very well, and have heard much about him since he died.
Therefore he has become to me a distinct presence which I can summon at will. The same is true
of others with whom the apartments are associated. If I wish I can summon them."

"I am at a loss to know which is the greater, your will or your imagination."

"My imagination is the greater."

"It must be great, indeed," she said, smiling alluringly, "for I never knew of one who seemed
more untrammelled in circumstances than you are, or more under the dominion of his own will."

"Untrammelled!" he repeated, in a low, almost desperate tone.

"Yes," she replied, warmly,--"free to carry out every generous and noble impulse of manhood.
I tell you frankly that you have led me to believe that you have such impulses."

His face became ashen in its hue, and he trembled visibly. He seemed about to speak some words
as if they were wrung from him, then he became almost rigid in his self-control as he said,
"There are limitations of which you cannot dream;" and he introduced a topic wholly remote
from himself.

A chill benumbed her very heart, and she scarcely sought to prevent it from tingeing her words
and manner. A few moments later the postman left a letter. She saw Lane's handwriting and said,
"Will you pardon me a moment, that I may learn that my FRIEND is well?"

Glancing at the opening words, her eyes flashed with excitement as she exclaimed: "The campaign
has opened! They are on the march this stormy night."

"May I ask if your letter is from Strahan?" Merwyn faltered.

"It is not from Mr. Strahan," she replied, quietly.

He arose and stood before her as erect and cold as herself. "Will you kindly give Mr. Vosburgh
that book?" he said.

"Certainly."

"Will you also please say that I shall probably go to my country place in a day or two, and
therefore may not see him again very soon."

She was both disappointed and angry, for she had meant kindly by him. The very consciousness
that she had unbent so greatly, and had made what appeared to her pride an unwonted advance,
incensed her, and she replied, in cold irony: "I will give papa your message. It will seem
most natural to him, now that spring has come, that you should vary your mercantile with agricultural
pursuits."

He appeared stung to the very soul by her words, and his hands clinched in his desperate effort
to restrain himself. His white lips moved as he looked at her from eyes full of the agony of
a wounded spirit. Suddenly his tense form became limp, and, with a slight despairing gesture,
he said, wearily: "It is of no use. Good-by."

CHAPTER XXVI.

MARIAN'S INTERPRETATION OF MERWYN.

Shallow natures, like shallow waters, are easily agitated, and outward manifestations are in
proportion to the shallowness.  Superficial observers are chiefly impressed by visible emotion
and tumult.

With all her faults, Marian had inherited from her father a strong nature. Her intuitions had
become womanly and keen, and Merwyn's dumb agony affected her more deeply than a torrent of
impetuous words or any outward evidence of distress. She went back to her chair and shed bitter
tears; she scarcely knew why, until her father's voice aroused her by saying, "Why, Marian
dear, what IS the matter?"

"Oh, I am glad you have come," she said. "I have caused so much suffering that I feel as if
I had committed a crime;" and she gave an account of the recent interview.

"Let me reassure you," said her father, gravely. "You did mean kindly by Merwyn, and you gave
him, without being unwomanly, the best chance he could possibly have to throw off the incubus
that is burdening his life. If, with the opportunity he had to-night, and under the influence
of his love, he did not speak, his secret is one of which he cannot speak. At least, I fear
it is one of which he dares not speak to you, lest it should be fatal to him and all his hopes.
I cannot even guess what it is, but at all events it is of a serious nature, too grave to be
regarded any longer as secondary in our estimate of Mr. Merwyn's character. The shadow of this
mystery must not fall on you, and I am glad he is going away. I hoped that your greater kindness
and mine might lead him to reveal his trouble, that we could help him, and that a character
in many respects so unique and strong might be cleared of its shadows. In this case we might
not only have rendered a fellow-being a great service, but also have secured a friend capable
of adding much to our happiness.  This mystery, however, proves so deep-rooted and inscrutable
that I shall be glad to withdraw you from his influence until time and circumstance make all
plain, if they ever can. These old families often have dark secrets, and this young man, in
attaining his majority and property, has evidently become the possessor of one of them. In
spite of all his efforts to do well it is having a sinister influence over his life, and this
influence must not extend to yours. The mere fact that he does not take an active part in the
war is very subordinate in itself. Thousands who might do this as well as he are very well
content to stay at home. The true aspect of the affair is this: A chain of circumstances, unforeseen,
and uncaused by any premeditated effort on our part, has presented to his mind the most powerful
motives to take a natural part in the conflict. It has gradually become evident that the secret
of his restraint is a mystery that affects his whole being. Therefore, whether it be infirmity,
fault, or misfortune, he has no right to impose it on others, since it seems to be beyond remedy.
Do you not agree with me?"

"I could not do otherwise, papa. Yet, remembering how he looked to-night, I cannot help being
sorry for him, even though my mind inclines to the belief that constitutional timidity restrains
him. I never saw a man tremble so, and he turned white to his very lips. Papa, have you read
'The Fair Maid of Perth'?"

"Yes."

"Don't you remember MacIan, the young chief of Clan Quhele? This character always made a deep
impression on me, awakening at the same time pity and the strongest repulsion. I could never
understand him.  He was high-born, and lived at an age when courage was the commonest of traits,
while its absence was worse than crime. For the times he was endowed with every good quality
except the power to face danger.  This from the very constitution of his being he could not
do, and he, beyond all others, understood his infirmity, suffering often almost mortal agony
in view of it. For some reason I have been led to reread this story, and, in spite of myself,
that wretched young Scottish chieftain has become associated in my mind with Willard Merwyn.
He said to-night that his imagination was stronger than his will. I can believe it from his
words. His dead father and others have become distinct presences to him. In the same way he
calls up before his fancy the horrors of a battle-field, and he finds that he has not the power
to face them, that he cannot do it, no matter what the motives may be. He feels that he would
be simply overwhelmed with horror and faint-heartedness, and he is too prudent to risk the
shame of exposure."

"Well," said her father, sighing, as if he were giving up a pleasing dream, "you have thought
out an ingenious theory which, if true, explains Merwyn's course, perhaps. A woman's intuitions
are subtle, and often true, but somehow it does not satisfy me, even though I can recall some
things which give color to your view. Still, whatever be the explanation, all MUST be explained
before we can give him more than ordinary courtesy."

It soon became evident that Merwyn had gone to his country place, for his visits ceased. The
more Marian thought about him,--and she did think a great deal,--the more she was inclined
to believe that her theory explained everything. His very words, "You think me a coward," became
a proof, in her mind, that he was morbidly sensitive on this point, and ever conscious of his
infirmity. He was too ready to resent a fancied imputation on his courage.

She strove to dismiss him from her thoughts, but with only partial success. He gave her the
sense of being baffled, defeated. What could be more natural than that a high-spirited young
man should enter the army of his own free will? He had not entered it even with her favor,
possibly her love, as a motive. Yet he sought her favor as if it were the chief consideration
of existence. With her theory, and her ideal of manhood, he was but the mocking shadow of a
man, but so real, so nearly perfect, that she constantly chafed at the defect. Even her father
had been deeply impressed by the rare promise of his young life,--a promise which she now believed
could never be kept, although few might ever know it.

"I must be right in my view," she said. "He proves his loyalty by an unflagging interest in
our arms, by the gift of thousands. He is here, his own master. He would not shun danger for
the sake of his cold-hearted mother, from whom he seems almost estranged. His sisters are well
provided for, and do not need his care. He does not live for the sake of pleasure, like many
other young men. Merciful Heaven! I blush even to think the words, much more to speak them.
Why does he not go, unless his fear is greater than his love for me? why is he not with Lane
and Strahan, unless he has a constitutional dread that paralyzes him? He is the Scottish chieftain,
MacIan, over again. All I can do now is to pity him as one to whom Nature has been exceedingly
cruel, for every fibre in my being shrinks from such a man."

And so he came to dwell in her mind as one crippled, from birth, in his very soul.

Meanwhile events took place which soon absorbed her attention. Lane's letter announcing the
opening of the campaign proved a false alarm, although, from a subsequent letter, she learned
that he had had experiences not trifling in their nature. On the rainy night, early in April,
that would ever be memorable to her, she had said to Merwyn, "The army is on the march."

This was true of the cavalry corps, and part of it even crossed the upper waters of the Rappahannock;
but the same storm which dashed the thick drops against her windows also filled the river to
overflowing, and the brave troopers, recalled, had to swim their horses in returning. Lane
was among these, and his humorous account of the affair was signed, "Your loyal amphibian!"

A young girl of Marian's temperament is a natural hero-worshipper, and he was becoming her
hero. Circumstances soon occurred which gave him a sure place in this character.

By the last of April, not only the cavalry, but the whole army, moved, the infantry taking
position on the fatal field of Chancellorsville. Then came the bloody battle, with its unspeakable
horrors and defeat. The icy Rappahannock proved the river of death to thousands and thousands
of brave men.

Early in May the Union army, baffled, depleted, and discouraged, was again in its old quarters
where it had spent the winter. Apparently the great forward movement had been a failure, but
it was the cause of a loss to the Confederate cause from which it never recovered,--that of
"Stonewall" Jackson. So transcendent were this man's boldness and ability in leading men that
his death was almost equivalent to the annihilation of a rebel army. He was a typical character,
the embodiment of the genius, the dash, the earnest, pure, but mistaken patriotism of the South.
No man at the North more surely believed he was right than General Jackson, no man more reverently
asked God's blessing on efforts heroic in the highest degree. He represented the sincere but
misguided spirit which made every sacrifice possible to a brave people, and his class should
ever be distinguished from the early conspirators who were actuated chiefly by ambition and
selfishness.

His death also was typical, for he was wounded by a volley fired, through misapprehension,
by his own men. The time will come when North and South will honor the memory of Thomas J.
Jackson, while, at the same time, recognizing that his stout heart, active brain, and fiery
zeal were among the chief obstructions to the united and sublime destiny of America. The man's
errors were due to causes over which he had little control; his noble character was due to
himself and his faith in God.

Many days passed before Marian heard from Lane, and she then learned that the raid in which
he had participated had brought him within two miles of Richmond, and that he had passed safely
through great dangers and hardships, but that the worst which he could say of himself was that
he was "prone to go to sleep, even while writing to her."

The tidings from her other friends were equally reassuring. Their regiment had lost heavily,
and Blauvelt had been made a captain almost in spite of himself, while Strahan was acting as
lieutenant-colonel, since the officer holding that rank had been wounded. There was a dash
of sadness and tragedy in the journal which the two young men forwarded to her after they had
been a few days in their old camp at Falmouth, but Strahan's indomitable humor triumphed, and
their crude record ended in a droll sketch of a plucked cock trying to crow. She wrote letters
so full of sympathy and admiration of their spirit that three soldiers of the army of the Potomac
soon recovered their morale.

The month of May was passing in mocking beauty to those whose hopes and happiness were bound
up in the success of the Union armies. Not only had deadly war depleted Hooker's grand army,
but the expiration of enlistments would take away nearly thirty thousand more. Mr. Vosburgh
was aware of this, and he also found the disloyal elements by which he was surrounded passing
into every form of hostile activity possible within the bounds of safety. Men were beginning
to talk of peace, at any cost, openly, and he knew that the Southern leaders were hoping for
the beginning at any time of a counter-revolution at the North. The city was full of threatening
rumors, intrigues, and smouldering rebellion.

Marian saw her father overwhelmed with labors and anxieties, and letters from her friends reflected
the bitterness then felt by the army because the North appeared so half-hearted.

"Mr. Merwyn, meanwhile," she thought, "is interesting himself in landscape-gardening. If he
has one spark of manhood or courage he will show it now."

The object of this reproach was living almost the life of a hermit at his country place, finding
no better resource, in his desperate unrest and trouble, than long mountain rambles, which
brought physical exhaustion and sleep.

He had not misunderstood Marian's final words and manner.  Delicately, yet clearly, she had
indicated the steps he must take to vindicate his character and win her friendship. He felt
that he had become pale, that he had trembled in her presence. What but cowardice could explain
his manner and account for his inability to confirm the good impression he had made by following
the example of her other friends? From both his parents he had inherited a nature sensitive
to the last degree to any imputation of this kind. To receive it from the girl he loved was
a hundred-fold more bitter than death, yet he was bound by fetters which, though unseen by
all, were eating into his very soul. The proud Mrs. Merwyn was a slave-holder herself, and
the daughter of a long line of slave-owners; but never had a bondsman been so chained and crushed
as was her son. For weeks he felt that he could not mingle with other men, much less meet the
girl to whom manly courage was the corner-stone of character.

One evening in the latter part of May, as Mr. Vosburgh and his family were sitting down to
dinner, Barney Ghegan, the policeman, appeared at their door with a decent-looking, elderly
colored woman and her lame son. They were refugees, or "contrabands," as they were then called,
from the South, and they bore a letter from Captain Lane.

It was a scrap of paper with the following lines pencilled upon it:--

"MR. VOSBURGH, No. -- -- ST.: I have only time for a line. Mammy Borden will tell you her story
and that of her son. Their action and other circumstances have enlisted my interest. Provide
them employment, if convenient. At any rate, please see that they want nothing, and draw on
me. Sincere regard to you all.--In haste,

"LANE, Captain.-- --U.S. Cav."

It can be well understood that the two dusky strangers, recommended by words from Lane, were
at once invested with peculiar interest to Marian. Many months had elapsed since she had seen
him, but all that he had written tended to kindle her imagination. This had been the more true
because he was so modest in his accounts of the service in which he had participated. She had
learned what cavalry campaigning meant, and read more meaning between the lines than the lines
themselves conveyed. He was becoming her ideal knight, on whom no shadow rested. From first
to last his course had been as open as the day, nor had he, in any respect, failed to reach
the highest standard developed by those days of heroic action.

If this were true when "Mammy Borden" and her son appeared, the reader can easily believe that,
when they completed their story, Captain Lane was her Bayard sans peur et sans reproche.

Barney explained that they had met him in the street and asked for Mr. Vosburgh's residence;
as it was nearly time for him to be relieved of duty he told them that in a few moments he
could guide them to their destination. Marian's thanks rewarded him abundantly, and Mrs. Vosburgh
told him that if he would go to the kitchen he should have a cup of coffee and something nice
to take home to his wife. They both remained proteges of the Vosburghs, and received frequent
tokens of good-will and friendly regard. While these were in the main disinterested, Mr. Vosburgh
felt that in the possibilities of the future it might be to his advantage to have some men
in the police force wholly devoted to his interests.

The two colored refugees were evidently hungry and weary, and, eager as Marian was to learn
more of her friend when informed that he had been wounded, she tried to content herself with
the fact that he was doing well, until the mother and son had rested a little and had been
refreshed by an abundant meal. Then they were summoned to the sitting-room, for Mr. and Mrs.
Vosburgh shared in Marian's deep solicitude and interest.

It was evident that their humble guests, who took seats deferentially near the door, had been
house-servants and not coarse plantation slaves, and in answer to Mr. Vosburgh's questions
they spoke in a better vernacular than many of their station could employ.

"Yes, mass'r," the woman began, "we seed Mass'r Lane,--may de Lord bress 'im,--and he was a
doin' well when we lef. He's a true Linkum man, an' if all was like him de wah would soon be
ended an' de cullud people free. What's mo', de white people of de Souf wouldn't be so bitter
as dey now is."

"Tell us your story, mammy," said Marian, impatiently; "tell us everything you know about Captain
Lane."

A ray of intelligence lighted up the woman's sombre eyes, for she believed she understood Marian's
interest, and at once determined that Lane's action should lose no embellishment which she
could honestly give.

"Well, missy, it was dis away," she said. "My mass'r and his sons was away in de wah. He own
a big plantation an' a great many slabes. My son, Zeb dar, an' I was kep' in de house. I waited
on de missus an' de young ladies, an' Zeb was kep' in de house too, 'kase he was lame and 'kase
dey could trus' him wid eberyting an' dey knew it.

"Well, up to de time Cap'n Lane come we hadn't seen any ob de Linkum men, but we'd heared ob
de prockermation an' know'd we was free, far as Mass'r Linkum could do it, an' Zeb was jus'
crazy to git away so he could say, 'I'se my own mass'r.' I didn't feel dat away, 'kase I was
brought up wid my missus, an' de young ladies was a'most like my own chillen, an' we didn't
try to get away like some ob de plantation han's do.

"Well, one ebenin', short time ago, a big lot ob our sogers come marchin' to our house--dey
was hoss sogers--an' de missus an' de young ladies knew some of de ossifers, an' dey flew aroun'
an' got up a big supper fo' dem. We all turned in, an' dar was hurry-skurry all ober de big
house, fo' de ossifers sed dey would stay all night if de sogers ob you-uns would let dem.
Dey said de Linkum sogers was comin' dat away, but dey wouldn't be 'long afore de mawnin',
an' dey was a-gwine to whip dem. All was light talk an' larfin' an' jingle ob sabres. De house
was nebber so waked up afo'. De young ladies was high-strung an' beliebed dat one ob our sogers
could whip ten Linkum men. In de big yard betwixt de house an' de stables de men was feedin'
dere hosses, an' we had a great pot ob coffee bilin' fo' dem, too, an' oder tings, fo' de missus
sed dere sogers mus' hab eberyting she had.

"Well, bimeby, as I was helpin' put de tings on de table, I heared shots way off at de foot
ob de lawn. Frontin' de house dar was a lawn mos' half a mile long, dat slope down to de road,
and de Linkum sogers was 'spected to come dat away, an' dere was a lookout for dem down dar.
As soon as de ossifers heared de shots dey rush out an' shout to dere men, an' dey saddle up
in a hurry an' gallop out in de lawn in front of de house an' form ranks."

"How many were there?" Marian asked, her cheeks already burning with excitement.

"Law, missy, I doesn't know. Dere was a right smart lot--hundreds I should tink."

"Dere was not quite two hundred, missy," said Zeb; "I counted dem;" and then he looked towards
his mother, who continued.

"De young ladies an' de missus went out on de verandy dat look down de lawn, and Missy Roberta,
de oldest one, said, 'Now, maumy, you can see the difference between our sogers an' de Linkum
men, as you call dem.' Missy Roberta had great black eyes an' was allus a-grievin' dat she
wasn't a man so she could be a soger, but Missy S'wanee had blue eyes like her moder, an' was
as full ob frolic as a kitten. She used ter say, 'I doesn't want ter be a man, fer I kin make
ten men fight fer me.' So she could, sho' 'nuff, fer all de young men in our parts would fight
de debil hisself for de sake ob Missy S'wanee."

"Go on, go on," cried Marian; "the Northern soldiers were coming--"

"Deed, an' dey was, missy,--comin' right up de lawn 'fore our eyes, an' dribin' in a few ob
our sogers dat was a-watchin' fer dem by de road; dey come right 'long too. I could see dere
sabres flashin' in de sunset long way off. One ossifer set dere men in ranks, and den de oder
head ossifer come ridin' up to de verandy, an' Missy Roberta gave de ribbin from her ha'r to
de one dey call cunnel, an' de oder ossifer ask Missy S'wanee fer a ribbin, too. She larf an'
say, 'Win it, an' you shall hab it.' Den off dey gallop, Missy Roberta cryin' arter dem, 'Don't
fight too fa' away; I want to see de Linkum hirelin's run.' Den de words rung out, 'For'ard,
march, trot,' an' down de lawn dey went. De Linkum men was now in plain sight. Zeb, you tell
how dey look an' what dey did. I was so afeard fer my missus and de young ladies, I was 'mos'
out ob my mind."

"Well, mass'r and ladies," said Zeb, rising and making a respectful bow, "I was at an upper
window an' could see eberyting. De Linkum men was trottin' too, an' comin' in two ranks, one
little way 'hind de toder. Right smart way afore dese two ranks was a line of calvary-men a
few feet apart from each oder, an' dis line reach across de hull lawn to de woods on de oder
side. I soon seed dat dere was Linkum sogers in de woods, too. Dey seemed sort ob outside sogers
all aroun' de two ranks in de middle. Dey all come on fas', not a bit afeard, an' de thin line
in front was firin' at our sogers dat had been a-watchin' down by de road, an' our sogers was
a-firin' back.

"Bimeby, soon, bofe sides come nigh each oder, den de thin line ob Linkum men swept away to
de lef at a gallop, an' our sogers an' de fust rank ob Linkum men run dere hosses at each oder
wid loud yells.  'Clar to you, my heart jus' stood still. Neber heard such horrid noises, but
I neber took my eyes away, for I beliebed I saw my freedom comin'. Fer a while I couldn't tell
how it was gwine; dere was nothin' but clash ob sabres, an' bofe sides was all mixed up, fightin'
hand ter hand.

"I was wonderin' why de second rank of Linkum men didn't do nothin', for dey was standin' still
wid a man on a hoss, out in front ob dem.  Suddenly I heard a bugle soun', an' de Linkum men
dat was fightin' gave way to right an' lef, an' de man on de hoss wave his sword an' start
for'ard at a gallop wid all his men arter him. Den our sogers 'gan to give back, fightin' as
dey came. Dey was brave, dey was stubborn as mules, but back dey had to come. De head Linkum
ossifer was leadin' all de time. I neber seed such a man, eberyting an' eberybody guv way afo'
him. De oder Linkum sogers dat I thought was whipped wasn't whipped at all, fer dey come crowdin'
aroun' arter de head ossifer, jes' as peart as eber.

"Front ob de house our ossifers an' sogers made a big stan', fer de missus an' de young ladies
stood right dar on de verandy, wabin' dere hankerchiefs an' cryin' to dem to dribe de Yankee
back. I knowed my moder was on de verandy, an' I run to her, an' sho' 'nuff, dar she was stan'in'
right in front of Missy S'wanee an' 'treating de missus an' de young ladies ter go in, fer
de bullets was now flyin' tick. But dey wouldn't go in, an' Missy Roberta was wringin' her
han's, an' cryin', 'Oh, dat I was a man!' De cunnel, de oder ossifer, an' a lot ob our sogers
wouldn't give back an inch. Dar dey was, fightin' right afore our eyes. De rest ob dere sogers
was givin' way eb'rywhar. De Linkum sogers soon made a big rush togedder. De cunnel's hoss
went down. In a minute dey was surrounded; some was killed, some wounded, an' de rest all taken,
'cept de young ossifer dat Missy S'wanee tole to win her colors. He was on a po'ful big hoss,
an' he jes' break right through eb'ryting, an' was off wid de rest. De Linkum sogers followed
on, firin' at 'em.

"De missus fainted dead away, an' my moder held her in her arms. De head Linkum ossifer now
rode up to de verandy an' took off his hat, an' he say: 'Ladies, I admire your co'age, but
you should not 'spose yourselves so needlessly. Should de vict'ry still remain wid our side,
I promise you 'tection an 'munity from 'noyance!'

"Den he bow an' gallop arter his men dat was chasin' our sogers, leabin' anoder ossifer in
charge ob de pris'ners. De head Linkum man was Cap'n Lane."

"I knew it, I knew it," cried Marian. "Ah! he's a friend to be proud of."

Her father and mother looked at her glowing cheeks and flashing eyes, and dismissed Merwyn
from the possibilities of the future.

CHAPTER XXVIIL

The Signal Light.

The colored woman again took up the thread of the story which would explain her presence and
her possession of a note from Captain Lane, recommending her and her son to Mr. Vosburgh's
protection.

"Yes, missy," she said, "Cap'n Lane am a fren' ter be proud ob. I tinks he mus' be like Mass'r
Linkum hisself, fer dere nebber was a man more braver and more kinder. Now I'se gwine ter tell
yer what happen all that drefful night, an' Zeb will put in his word 'bout what he knows. While
de cap'n was a-speakin' to de young ladies, de missus jes' lay in my arms as ef she was dead.
Missy Roberta, as she listen, stand straight and haughty, an' give no sign she hear, but Missy
S'wanee, she bow and say, 'Tank you, sir!' Zeb called some ob de house-servants, an' we carry
de missus to her room, an' de young ladies help me bring her to. Den I stayed wid her, a-fannin'
her an' a-cheerin' an' a-tellin' her dat I knew Cap'n Lane wouldn't let no harm come ter dem.
Now, Zeb, you seed what happen downstars."

"Yes, mass'r an' ladies, I kep' my eyes out, fer I tinks my chance is come now, if eber. Cap'n
Lane soon come back an' said to de ossifer in charge ob de pris'ners,--an' dere was more pris'ners
bein' brought in all de time,--sez Cap'n Lane, 'De en'my won't stand agin. I'se sent Cap'n
Walling in pursuit, an' now we mus' make prep'rations fer de night.' Den a man dey call a sergeant,
who'd been a spyin' roun' de kitchen, an' lookin' in de dinin'-room winders, come up an' say
something to Cap'n Lane; an' he come up to de doah an' say he like ter see one ob de ladies.
I call Missy S'wanee, an' she come, cool an' lady-like, an' not a bit afeard, an' he take off
his hat to her, an' say:--

"'Madam, I'se sorry all dis yer happen 'bout yer house, but I'se could not help it. Dere's
a good many woun'ed, an' our surgeon is gwine ter treat all alike. I'se tole dat yer had coffee
a-bilin' an' supper was ready. Now all I ask is, dat de woun'ed on bofe sides shall have 'freshments
fust, an' den ef dere's anyting lef', I'd like my ossifers to have some supper.' Den he kinder
smile as he say, 'I know you 'spected oder company dis ebenin', an' when de woun'ed is provided
fer, de ossifers on your side can hab supper too. I hab ordered de hospital made in de out-buildin's,
an' de priv'cy ob your home shall not be 'truded on.'

"'Cunnel,' say Missy S'wanee. 'Plain Cap'n,' he say, interrupting--'Cap'n Lane.'

"'Cap'n Lane, she goes on, 'I tanks you fer your courtesy, an 'sideration. I did not 'spect
it. Your wishes shall be carried out.' Den she says, 'I'se'll hab more supper pervided, an'
we'll 'spect you wid your ossifers;' for she wanted ter make fren's wid him, seein' we was
all in his po'er. He says, 'No, madam, I'se take my supper wid my men. I could not be an unwelcome
gues' in any house, What I asks for my ossifers, I asks as a favor; I doesn't deman' it.' Den
he bows an' goes away. Missy S'wanee, she larf--she was allus a-larfin' no matter what happen--an'
she says, 'I'se'll get eben wid him.' Well, de cap'n goes an' speaks to de cunnel, an' de oder
captured ossifers ob our sogers, an' dey bow to him, an' den dey comes up an' sits on de verandy,
an' Missy Roberta goes out, and dey talk in low tones, an' I couldn't hear what dey say. I
was a-helpin' Missy S'wanee, an' she say to me, 'Zeb, could you eber tink dat a Yankee cap'n
could be such a gemlin?' I didn't say nuffin', fer I didn't want anybody ter'spect what was
in my min', but eb'ry chance I git I keep my eye on Cap'n Lane, fer I believed he could gib
us our liberty. He was aroun' 'mong de woun'ed, an' seein' ter buryin' de dead, an' postin'
an' arrangin' his men; deed, an' was all ober eberywhar.

"By dis time de ebenin' was growin' dark, de woun'ed and been cared for, an' our ossifers an'
de Linkum ossifers sat down to supper; an' dey talk an' larf as if dey was good fren's. Yer'd
tink it was a supper-party, ef dere hadn't been a strappin' big soger walkin' up an' down de
verandy whar he could see in de winders. I help waits on de table, an' Missy Roberta, she was
rudder still an' glum-like, but Missy S'wanee, she smiles on all alike, an' she say to de Linkum
ossifers, 'I 'predate de court'sy ob your cap'n, eben do' he doesn't grace our board. I shall
take de liberty, howsemeber, ob sendin' him some supper;' an' she put a san'wich an' some cake
an' a cup ob coffee on a waiter an' sen' me out to him whar he was sittin' by de fire in de
edge ob de woods on de lawn. He smile an' say, 'Tell de young lady dat I drink to her health
an' happier times.' Den I gits up my co'age an' says, 'Cap'n Lane, I wants ter see yer when
my work's done in de house.' He say, 'All right, come ter me here.' Den he look at me sharp
an' say, 'Can I trus' yer?' An' I say, 'Yes, Mass'r Cap'n; I'se Linkum, troo an' troo.' Den
he whisper in my ear de password, 'White-rose.'"

Marian remembered that she had given him a white rose when he had asked for her colors. He
had made it his countersign on the evening of his victory.

"Arter supper our ossifers were taken down ter de oder pris'ners, an' guards walk aroun dem
all night. I help clar up de tings, an' watch my chance ter steal away. At las' de house seem
quiet. I tought de ladies had gone ter dere rooms, an' I put out de light in de pantry, an'
was watchin' an' waitin' an' listenin' to be sho' dat no one was 'roun, when I heared a step
in de hall. De pantry doah was on a crack, an' I peeps out, an' my bref was nigh took away
when I sees a rebel ossifer, de one dat got away in de fight. He give a long, low whistle,
an' den dere was a rustle in de hall above, an' Missy Roberta came flyin' down de starway.
I know den dat dere was mischief up, an' I listen wid all my ears. She say to him, 'How awfully
imprudent!' An' she put de light out in de hall, les' somebody see in. Den she say, 'Shell
we go in de parlor?' He say, 'No, dere's two doahs here, each end de hall, an' a chance ter
go out de winders, too. I mus' keep open ebery line ob retreat. Are dere any Yanks in de house?'
She say, 'No,'--dat de Union cap'n very 'sid'rate. 'Curse him!' sed de reb; 'he spoil my ebenin'
wid Miss S'wanee, but tell her I win her colors yet, an' pay dis Yankee cap'n a bigger interest
in blows dan he eber had afo.' Den he 'splain how he got his men togedder, an' he foun' anoder
'tachment ob rebs, an' how dey would all come in de mawnin', as soon as light, an' ride right
ober eberyting, an' 'lease de cunnel an' all de oder pris'ners. Den he says, 'We'se a-comin'
on de creek-road. Put a dim light in de winder facin' dat way, an' as long as we see it burnin'
we'll know dat all's quiet an' fav'able, an' tell Missy S'wanee to hab her colors ready. Dey
tought I was one oh de Yanks in de dark, when I come in, but gettin' away'll be more tick'lish.'
Den she say, 'Don't go out ob de doah. Drap from de parlor winder inter de shrub'ry, an' steal
away troo de garden.' While dey was gone ter de parlor, I step out an' up de starway mighty
sudden. Den I whip aroun' to de beginnin' ob de garret starway an' listen. Soon Missy Roberta
come out de parlor an' look in de pantry an' de oder rooms, an' she sof'ly call me, 'kase she
know I was las' up 'round de house; but I'se ain't sayin' nuffin'. Den she go in de missus
room, whar my moder was, an' soon she and Missy S'wanee came out an' whisper, an' Missy S'wanee
was a-larfin' how as ef she was pleased.  Den Missy S'wanee go back to de missus, an' Missy
Roberta go to her room.

"Now was my chance, an' I tuck off'n my shoes an' carried dem, an' I tank de Lord I heared
it all, fer I says, 'Cap'n Lane'll give me my liberty now sho' 'nuff, when I tells him all.'
I'se felt sho' he'd win de fight in de mawnin', fer he seemed ob de winnin' kine. I didn't
open any ob de doahs on de fust floah, but stole down in de cellar, 'kase I knowed ob a winder
dat I could creep outen. I got away from de house all right, an' went toward de fire where
I lef Cap'n Lane. Soon a gruff voice said, 'Halt!' I guv de password mighty sudden, an' den
said, 'I want to see Cap'n Lane.' De man call anoder soger, an' he come an' question me, an'
den took me ter de cap'n. An' he was a-sleepin' as if his moder had rocked 'im! But he was
on his feet de moment he spoke to. He 'membered me, an' ask ef de mawnin' wouldn't answer.
I say, 'Mass'r Cap'n, I'se got big news fer yer.' Den he wide awake sho' 'nuff, an' tuck me
one side, an' I tole him all. 'What's yer name?' he says. 'Zeb Borden,' I answers.  Den he
say: 'Zeb, you've been a good fren'. Ef I win de fight in de mawnin' you shell hab your liberty.
It's yours now, ef you can get away.' I says I'se lame an' couldn't get away unless he took
me, an' dat I wanted my moder ter go, too. Den he tought a minute, an' went back ter de fire
an' tore out a little book de paper we brought, an' he says, 'What your moder's name?' An'
I says, 'Dey call her Maumy Borden.' Den he wrote de lines we bring, an' he says: 'No tellin'
what happen in de mawnin'. Here's some money dat will help you 'long when you git in our lines.
Dis my fust inderpendent comman', an' ef yer hadn't tole me dis I might a' los' all I gained.
Be faithful, Zeb; keep yer eyes an' ears open, an' I'll take care ob yer. Now slip back, fer
yer might be missed.'"

"I got back to my lof' mighty sudden, an' I was jis' a-shakin' wid fear, for I beliebe dat
Missy Roberta would a' killed me wid her own hands ef she'd knowed. She was like de ole mass'r,
mighty haughty an' despit-like, when she angry. I wasn't in de lof' none too soon, fer Missy
Roberta was 'spicious and uneasy-like, an' she come to de head ob de gerret starway an' call
my name. At fust I ain't sayin' suffin', an' she call louder. Den I say, 'Dat you, Missy Roberta?'
Den she seem to tink dat I was all right. I slipped arter her down de starway an' listen, an'
I know she gwine ter put de light in de winder. Den she go to her room again.

"A long time pass, an' I hear no soun'. De house was so still dat I done got afeard, knowin'
dere was mischief up. Dere was a little winder in my lof lookin' toward de creek-road, an'
on de leabes ob some trees I could see a little glimmer ob de light dat Missy Roberta had put
dar as a signal. Dat glimmer was jes' awful, fer I knowed it mean woun's and death to de sogers,
an' liberty or no liberty fer me. Bimeby I heared steps off toward de creek-road, but dey soon
die away. I watched an' waited ter'ble long time, an' de house an' all was still, 'cept de
tread ob de guards. Mus' a' been about tree in de mawnin' when I heared a stir. It was very
quiet-like, an' I hear no words, but now an' den dere was a jingle like a sabre make when a
man walk. I stole down de starway an' look outen a winder in de d'rection whar Cap'n Lane was,
an' I see dat de Linkum men had let all dere fires go out. It was bery dark. Den I hear Missy
Roberta open her doah, an' I whip back ter my lof. She come soon an' had a mighty hard time
wakin' me up. an' den she say: 'Zeb, dere's sumpen goin' on 'mong de Yankee sogers. Listen.'
I says, 'I doesn't hear nuffin'.' She says: 'Dere is; dey's a-saddlin' up, an' movin' roun'.
I want you ter steal outen an' see what dey is doin', an' tell me.' I says, 'Yes, missy.' I
tought de bole plan would be de bes' plan now, an' I put on my shoes an' went out. Putty soon
I comes back and says to her, 'I axed a man, an' he tole me dey was changin' de guard.'--'Did
de res' seem quiet?'--'Yes, missy, dey is sleepin' 'round under de trees.' She seemed greatly
'lieved, an' says, 'You watch aroun' an' tell me ef dere's any news.' I stole out again an'
crep' up 'hind some bushes, an' den I sho' dat de Linkum men was a-slippin' away toward de
creek-road, but de guards kep' walkin' 'roun de pris'ners, jes' de same. On a sudden dere was
a man right 'longside ob me, an' he say, 'Make a noise or move, an' you are dead. What are
you doin' here?' I gasp out, 'White-rose, Cap'n Lane.'--'Oh, it's you,' he say, wid a low larf.
Fo' I could speak dere come a scream, sich as I neber heared, den anoder an' anoder.  'Dey
comes from de missus' room.' Den he say, 'Run down dar an' ask de sergeant ob de guard to send
tree men wid you, an' come quick!' Now moder kin tell yer what happened. I had lef de back
hall doah unlocked, an' de cap'n went in like a flash."

"De good Lor' bress Cap'n Lane," began the colored woman, "fer he come just in time. De missus
had been wakin' an' fearful-like mos' ob de night, but at las' we was all a-dozin'. I was in
a char by her side, an' Missy S'wanee laid on a lounge. She hadn't undress, an' fer a long
time seemed as if listenin'. At las' dere come a low knock, an' we all started up. I goes to
de doah an' say, 'Who's dar?'--'A message from Cap'n Lane,' says a low voice outside. 'Open
de doah,' says Missy S'wanee; 'I'se not afeard ob him.' De moment I slip back de bolt, a big
man, wid a black face, crowds in an' say, 'Not a soun', as you valley your lives: I want yer
jewelry an' watches;' an' he held a pistol in his hand. At fust we tought it was a plantation
han', fer he tried ter talk like a cullud man, an' Missy S'wanee 'gan ter talk ter him; but
he drew a knife an' says, 'Dis won't make no noise, an' it'll stop yer noise ef yer make any.
Not a word, but gib up eberyting.' De missus was so beat out wid fear, dat she say, 'Gib him
eberyting.' An' Missy S'wanee, more'n half-dead, too, began to gib dere watches an' jewels.
De man put dem in his pocket, an' den he lay his hands on Missy S'wanee, to take off her ring.
Den she scream, an' I flew at 'im an' tried to tear his eyes out. Missy Roberta 'gan screamin',
so we knowed she was 'tacked too. De man was strong an' rough, an' whedder he would a' killed
us or not de Lord only knows, fer jes' den de doah flew wide open, an' Cap'n Lane stood dere
wid his drawn sword. In a secon' he seed what it all meant, an' sprung in an' grabbed de robber
by de neck an' jerked him outen inter de hall. Den de man 'gan ter beg fer mercy, an' tole
his name. It was one of Cap'n Lane's own sogers. At dis moment Missy Roberta rush outen her
room, cryin', 'Help!  murder!' Den we heared heaby steps rushing up de starway, an' tree ob
Cap'n Lane's sogers dash for'ard. As soon as Missy Roberta see de cap'n wid de light from de
open doah shinin' on his face, she comes an' ask, 'What does dis outrage mean?'--'It mean dat
dis man shell be shot in de mawnin', he say, in a chokin' kind ob voice, fer he seem almost
too angry to speak. Den he ask, 'Were you 'tacked also?'--' Yes,' she cried, 'dere's a man
in my room.'--'Which room?' An' she pointed to de doah. De fus' robber den made a bolt ter
get away, but de cap'n's men cotch 'im. 'Tie his han's 'hind his back, an' shoot him if he
tries to run agin,' said de cap'n; den he say to Missy Roberta: 'Go in your moder's room. Don't
leave it without my permission. Ef dere is a man in your room, he shall shar de fate ob dat
villain dat I've 'spected ob bein' a tief afore.' An' he went an' looken in Missy Roberta's
room. In a few moments he come back an' say, 'Dere was a man dar, but he 'scape troo de winder
on de verandy-roof. Ef I kin discober 'im he shall die too.' Den he say, grave an' sad-like:
'Ladies, dere is bad men in eb'ry army. I'se deeply mort'fied dat dis should happen. You'll
bar me witness dat I tried to save you from all 'noyance. I know dis man,' pointin' to a soger
dat stood near, 'an' I'll put him in dis hall on guard. His orders are--you hear dem--not to
let any one come in de hall, an' not to let any one leabe dis room. As long as yer all stay
in dis room, you are safe, eben from a word.' Missy S'wanee rush for'ard an' take his han',
an' say, 'Eben ef you is my en'my you'se a gallant soger an' a gemlin, an' I tanks you.' De
cap'n smile an' bow, an' say, 'In overcomin' your prej'dice I'se 'chieved my bes' vict'ry.'
An' he gib her back all de jewels an' watches, an' drew de doah to, an' lef us to ourselves.
Den we hear 'im go to a wes' room back ob de house wid anoder soger, an' soon he come back
alone, an' den de house all still 'cept de eben tread ob de man outside. Missy Roberta clasp
her han's an' look wild. Den she whisper to Missy S'wanee, an' dey seem in great trouble. Den
she go an' open de doah an' say to de soger dat she want ter go ter her room. 'You cannot,
lady,' said de soger. 'You heared my orders.'--'I'll only stay a minute,' she say. 'You cannot
pass dat doah,' said de soger. 'But I mus' an' will,' cried Missy Roberta, an' she make a rush
ter get out. De soger held her still. 'Unhan' me!' she almost screamed. He turn her 'roun'
an' push her back in de room, an' den says: 'Lady, does you tink a soger can disobey orders?
Dere ain't no use ob your takin' on 'bout dat light. We'se watch it all night as well as your
fren's, an' de cap'n has lef' a soger guardin' it, to keep it burnin'. Ef I should let yer
go, yer couldn't put it out, an' ef it had been put out any time, we'd a' lighted it agin.
So dere's nuffin' fer yer to do but 'bey orders an' shut de doah. Den no one will say a word
to yer, as de cap'n said.' Den he pulled de doah to hisself.

"Missy Roberta 'gan to wring her han's an' walk up an' down like a caged tiger, an' Missy S'wanee
larf and cry togedder as she say, 'Cap'n Lane too bright fer us.'--'No,' cries Missy Roberta,
'somebody's 'trayed me, an' I could strike a knife inter dere heart fer doin' it. O S'wanee,
S'wanee, our fren's is walkin' right inter a trap.' Den she run to de winder an' open it ter
see ef she couldn't git down, an' dere in de garden was a soger, a-walkin' up an' down a-watchin'.
'We jes' can't do nuffin',' she said, an' she 'gan to sob an' go 'sterical-like. Missy S'wanee
tole de missus, an' she wrung her han's an' cry, too; an' Missy S'wanee, she was a-larfin'
an' a-cryin', an' a-prayin' all ter once. Suddenly dere was a shot off toward de creek-road,
an' den we was bery still. Now.  Zeb, you know de res'!"

CHAPTER XXIX.

MARIAN CONTRASTS LANE AND MERWYN.

"Oh, come, this won't do at all," said Mr. Vosburgh, as Zeb was about to continue the story.
"It's nearly midnight now. Marian, dear, your cheeks and eyes look as if you had a fever. Let
us wait and hear the rest of the story in the morning, or you'll be ill, your mother will have
a headache, and I shall be unfit for my work to-morrow."

"Papa, papa, in pity don't stop them till we know all. If Captain Lane could watch all night
and fight in the morning, can't we listen for an hour longer?"

"Oh, yes," cried Mrs. Vosburgh, "let them finish. It's like a story, and I never could sleep
well till I knew how a story was going to turn out."

"Wait a moment and I'll bring everybody something nice from the sideboard, and you, also, papa,
a cigar from the library," cried the young girl.

Her father smiled his acquiescence, and in a few moments they were all ready to listen to the
completion of a tragedy not without its dash of comedy.

"Arter Cap'n Lane posted his guards in de house an' sent de robber off," Zeb resumed, "he jump
on a hoss an' gallop toward de creek-road. De light in de winder kep' a-burnin'! I foun' arterwards
dat he an' his ossifers had been down on de creek-road and studied it all out. At one place--whar
it was narrer' wid tick woods on bofe sides--dey had builded a high rail-fence. Den below dat
he had put sogers in de woods each side widout dere hosses, an' farder down still he had hid
a lot of men dat was mounted. Sho' 'nuff, wid de fust light of de mawnin', de rebs come ridin'
toward de light in de winder. I'd run out to de hill, not far away, ter see what would happen,
an' it was so dark yet dat eb'ryting was mixed up wid shadders. When de rebs was a-comin' by
de Linkum men in de woods a shot was fired. Den I s'pose de rebs tought it would gib de 'larm,
fer dey began ter run dere hosses for'ard. An' den de Linkum men let dem hab it on bofe sides
ob de road, but dey kep' on till dey come to de fence 'cross de road, an' den dey git a volley
in front. Dis skeered 'em, for dey knowed dat de Linkum men was ready, an' dey tried to git
back. Den I heared a great tramplin' an' yellin', an' dere was Cap'n Lane a-leadin' his men
an' hosses right in ahind dem.  Dere was orful fightin' fer a while, an' de men widout dere
hosses leap outen de woods and shot like mad. It was flash! bang! on eb'ry side. At las' de
Linkum men won de day, an' some ob de rebs burst troo de woods an' run, wid Cap'n Lane's men
arter dem, an' dey kep' a-chasin' till a bugle call dem back. Den I run to de house, fer dey
was bringin' in de pris'ners. Who should I see 'mong dese but de bery ossifer dat was wid Missy
Roberta de night afore, de one dat wanted de light in de winder, an' he look bery mad, I can
tell you.

"It was now gettin' broad day, an' de light at las' was outen de winder. Dere was nuffin' mo'
fer it to do. De Linkum soger dat had been in de house was now helpin' guard de pris'ners,
an' Missy Roberta an' Missy S'wanee run up to de ossifer dat had been so fooled an' say: 'We'se
couldn't help it. Somebody 'trayed us. We was kep' under guard, an' dere was a Yankee soger
a-keepin' de light burnin' arter we knew Cap'n Lane was aroun' an' ready.' Missy Roberta look
sharp at me, but I 'peared innercent as a sheep. Missy S'wanee say: 'No matter, Major Denham,
you did all dat a brave man could do, an' dar's my colors. You hab won dem.' An' den he cheer
up 'mazin'ly.

"Den I hear somebody say Cap'n Lane woun'ed, an' I slip out toward de creek-road, an' dar I
see dem a-carryin Cap'n Lane, an' de surgeon walkin' 'longside ob him. My heart jes' stood
still wid fear. His eyes was shut, an' he look bery pale-like. Dey was a-carryin' him up de
steps ob de verandy when Missy S'wanee came runnin' ter see what was de matter. Den Cap'n Lane
open his eyes an' he say: 'Not in here. Put me wid de oder woun'ed men; 'but Missy S'wanee
say, 'No; he protec' us an' act like a gemlin, an' he shall learn dat de ladies ob de Souf
will not be surpassed.' De missus say de same, but Missy Roberta frown an' say nuffin'. She
too much put out yet 'bout dat light in de winder an' de 'feat it brought her fren's. De cap'n
was too weak an' gone-like ter say anyting mo', an' dey carry him up ter de bes' company room.
I goes up wid dem ter wait on de surgeon, an' he 'zamin' de woun' an' gib de cap'n brandy,
an' at las' say dat de cap'n get well ef he keep quiet a few weeks,--dat he weak now from de
shock an' loss ob blood.

"In de arternoon hundreds more Linkum men come, an' Cap'n Lane's cunnel come wid dem, an' he
praise de cap'n an' cheer him up, an' de cap'n was bery peart an' say he feel better. Mos'
ob de ossifers take supper at de house. De missus an' Missy Roberta were perlite but bery cold-like,
but Missy S'wanee, while she show dat she was a reb down to de bottom ob her good, kine heart,
could smile an' say sunshiny tings all de same. Dis night pass bery quiet, an' in de mawnin'
de Linkum cunnel say he hab orders ter 'tire toward de Union lines. He feel bery bad 'bout
leabin' Cap'n Lane, but de surgeon say he mus' not be moved. He say, too, dat he stay wid de
cap'n an' de oder badly woun'ed men. De cap'n tell his cunnel 'bout me an' my moder an' what
he promise us, an' de cunnel say he take us wid him an' send us to Washin'on. De missus an'
de young ladies take on drefful 'bout our gwine, but I say, 'I mus' hab my liberty,' an' moder
say she can't part wid her own flesh an' blood--"

"Yes, yes, but what did 'Cap'n' Lane say?" interrupted Marian.

"He tole me ter say ter you, missy, dat he was gwine ter git well, an' dat you mus'n't worry
'kase you didn't hear from him, an' dat he know you'd be kine to us, 'kase I'd help him win
de vict'ry. De surgeon wrote some letters, too, an' gib dem to de Linkum cunnel. P'raps you
git one ob dem. Dey put us in an army wagon, an' bimeby we reach a railroad, an' dey gib us
a pass ter Washin'on, an' we come right on heah wid Cap'n Lane's money. I doesn't know what
dey did with de robber--"

"Oh, oh," cried Marian, "it may be weeks before I hear from my friend again, if I 'ever do."

"Marian, dear," said her father, "do not look on the dark side; it might have been a hundred-fold
worse. 'Cap'n' Lane was in circumstances of great comfort, with his own surgeon in care of
his wound. Think how many poor fellows were left on the field of Chancellorsville to Heaven
only knows what fate. In such desperate fighting as has been described we have much reason
to be thankful that he was not killed outright. He has justly earned great credit with his
superiors, and I predict that he will get well and be promoted. I think you will receive a
letter in a day or two from the surgeon. I prescribe that you and mamma sleep in the morning
till you are rested. I won't grumble at taking my coffee alone." Then, to the colored woman
and her son: "Don't you worry. We'll see that you are taken care of."

Late as it was, hours still elapsed before Marian slept. Her hero had become more heroic than
ever. She dwelt on his achievements with enthusiasm, and thought of his sufferings with a tenderness
never before evoked, while the possibility that "Missy S'wanee" was his nurse produced twinges
approaching jealousy.

As was expected, the morning post brought a letter from the surgeon confirming the account
that had been given by the refugees, and full of hope-inspiring words. Then for weeks there
were no further tidings from Lane.

Meanwhile, events were culminating with terrible rapidity, and their threatening significance
electrified the North. The Southern people and their sympathizers everywhere were jubilant
over the victory of Chancellorsville, and both demanded and expected that this success should
be followed by decisive victories. Lee's army, General Longstreet said, was "in a condition
of strength and morale to undertake anything," and Southern public sentiment and the needs
of the Richmond government all pointed towards a second and more extended invasion of the North.
The army was indeed strong, disciplined, a powerful instrument in the hands of a leader like
General Lee. Nevertheless, it had reached about the highest degree of its strength. The merciless
conscription in the South had swept into its ranks nearly all the able-bodied men, and food
and forage were becoming so scarce in war-wasted Virginia and other regions which would naturally
sustain this force, that a bold, decisive policy had become a necessity. It was believed that
on Northern soil the army could be fed, and terms of peace dictated.

The chief motive for this step was the hope of a counter-revolution in the North where the
peace faction had grown bold and aggressive to a degree that only stopped short of open resistance.
The draft or general conscription which the President had ordered to take place in July awakened
intense hostility to the war and the government on the part of a large and rapidly increasing
class of citizens. This class had its influential and outspoken leaders, who were evidently
in league with a secret and disloyal organization known as the "Knights of the Golden Circle,"
the present object of which was the destruction of the Union and the perpetuation of slavery.
In the city of New York the spirit of rebellion was as rampant in the breasts of tens of thousands
as in Richmond, and Mr. Vosburgh knew it. His great sagacity and the means of information at
his command enabled him to penetrate much of the intrigue that was taking place, and to guess
at far more. He became haggard and almost sleepless from his labors and anxieties, for he knew
that the loyal people of the North were living over a volcano.

Marian shared in this solicitude, and was his chief confidante. He wished her, with her mother,
to go to some safe and secluded place in the country, and offered to lease again the cottage
which they had occupied the previous summer, but Marian said that she would not leave him,
and that he must not ask her to do so. Mrs. Vosburgh was eventually induced to visit relatives
in New England, and then father and daughter watched events with a hundred-fold more anxiety
than that of the majority, because they were better informed and more deeply involved in the
issues at stake than many others. But beyond all thought of worldly interests, their intense
loyal feeling burned with a pure, unwavering flame.

In addition to all that occupied her mind in connection with her father's cares and duties,
she had other grounds for anxiety. Strahan wrote that his regiment was marching northward,
and that he soon expected to take part in the chief battle of the war. Every day she hoped
for some news from Lane, but none came. His wishes in regard to Mammy Borden and her son had
been well carried out. Mr.  Vosburgh had been led to suspect that the man in charge of his
offices was becoming rather too curious in regard to his affairs, and too well informed about
them. Therefore Zeb was installed in his place; and when Mrs. Vosburgh departed on her visit
Marian dismissed the girl who had succeeded Sally Maguire, and employed the colored woman in
her stead. She felt that this action would be pleasing to Lane, and that it was the very least
that she could do.

Moreover, Mammy Borden was what she termed a "character," one to whom she could speak with
something of the freedom natural to the ladies of the Southern household. The former slave
could describe a phase of life and society that was full of novelty and romance to Marian,
and "de young ladies," especially "Missy S'wanee," were types of the Southern girl of whom
she never wearied of hearing. From the quaint talk of her new servant she learned to understand
the domestic life of those whom she had regarded as enemies, and was compelled to admit that
in womanly spirit and dauntless patriotism they were her equals, and had proved it by facing
dangers and hardships from which she had been shielded. More than all, the old colored woman
was a protegee of Captain Lane and was never weary of chanting his praises.

Marian was sincerely perplexed by the attitude of her mind towards this young officer. He kindled
her enthusiasm and evoked admiration without stint. He represented to her the highest type
of manhood in that period of doubt, danger, and strong excitement. Brave to the last degree,
his courage was devoid of recklessness. The simple, untutored description of his action given
by the refugees had only made it all the more clear that his mind was as keen and bright as
his sword, while in chivalric impulses he had never been surpassed. Unconsciously Mammy Borden
and her son had revealed traits in him which awakened Marian's deepest respect, suggesting
thoughts of which she would not have spoken to any one. She had been shown his course towards
beautiful women who were in his power, and who at the same time were plotting his destruction
and that of his command. While he foiled their hostile purpose, no knight of olden times could
have shown them more thoughtful consideration and respect. She felt that her heart ought to
go out towards this ideal lover in utter abandon. Why did it not? Why were her pride, exultation,
and deep solicitude too near akin to the emotions she would have felt had he been her brother?
Was this the only way in which she could love? Would the sacred, mysterious, and irresistible
impulses of the heart, of which she had read, follow naturally in due time?

She was inclined to believe that this was true, yet, to her surprise, the thought arose unbidden:
"If Willard Merwyn were showing like qualities and making the same record--What absurdity is
this!" she exclaimed aloud. "Why does this Mr. Merwyn so haunt me, when I could not give him
even respect and friendship, although he sent an army into the field, yet was not brave enough
to go himself? Where is he? What is he doing in these supreme hours of his country's history?
Everything is at stake at the front, yes, and even here at the North, for I can see that papa
dreads unspeakably what each day may bring forth, yet neither this terrible emergency nor the
hope of winning my love can brace his timid soul to manly action. There is more manhood in
one drop of the blood shed by Captain Lane than in Merwyn's whole shrinking body."

CHAPTER XXX.

THE NORTH INVADED.

Merwyn could scarcely have believed that he had sunk so low in Marian's estimation as her words
at the close of the previous chapter indicated, yet he guessed clearly the drift of her opinion
in regard to him, and he saw no way of righting himself. In the solitude of his country home
he considered and dismissed several plans of action. He thought of offering his services to
the Sanitary Commission, but his pride prevented, for he knew that she and others would ask
why a man of his youth and strength sought a service in which sisters of charity could be his
equals in efficiency. He also saw that joining a regiment of the city militia was but a half-way
measure that might soon lead to the violation of his oath, since these regiments could be ordered
to the South in case of an emergency.

The prospect before him was that of a thwarted, blighted life. He might live till he was gray,
but in every waking moment he would remember that he had lost his chance for manly action,
when such action would have brought him self-respect, very possibly happiness, and certainly
the consciousness that he had served a cause which now enlisted all his sympathies.

At last he wrote to his mother an impassioned appeal to be released from his oath, assuring
her that he would never have any part in the Southern empire that was the dream of her life.
He cherished the hope that she, seeing how unalterable were his feelings and purposes, would
yield to him the right to follow his own convictions, and with this kindling hope his mind
grew calmer.

Then, as reason began to assert itself, he saw that he had been absent from the city too long
already. His pride counselled: "The world has no concern with your affairs, disappointments,
or sufferings. Be your father's son, and maintain your position with dignity. In a few short
weeks you may be free. If not, your secret is your own, and no living soul can gossip about
your family affairs, or say that you betrayed your word or your family interests. Meanwhile,
in following the example of thousands of other rich and patriotic citizens, you can contribute
more to the success of the Union cause than if you were in the field."

He knew that this course might not secure him the favor of one for whom he would face every
danger in the world, but it might tend to disarm criticism and give him the best chances for
the future.

He at once carried out his new purposes, and early in June returned to his city home. He now
resolved no longer to shrink and hide, but to keep his own counsel, and face the situation
like one who had a right to choose his own career. Mr. Bodoin, his legal adviser, received
the impression that he had been quietly looking after his country property, and the lawyer
rubbed his bloodless hands in satisfaction over a youthful client so entirely to his mind.

Having learned more fully what his present resources were, Merwyn next called on Mr. Vosburgh
at his office. That gentleman greeted the young man courteously, disguising his surprise and
curiosity.

"I have just returned from my country place," Merwyn began, "and shall not have to go there
very soon again, Can I call upon you as usual?"

"Certainly," replied Mr. Vosburgh; but there was no warmth in his tone.

"I have also a favor to ask," resumed Merwyn, with a slight deepening of color in his bronzed
face. "I have not been able to follow events very closely, but so far as I can judge there
is a prospect of severe battles and of sudden emergencies. If there is need of money, such
means as I have are at your disposal."

Even Mr. Vosburgh, at the moment, felt much of Marian's repulsion as he looked at the tall
youth, with his superb physique, who spoke of severe battles and offered "money." "Truly,"
he thought, "she must be right. This man will part with thousands rather than risk one drop
of blood."

But he was too good a patriot to reveal his impression, and said, earnestly: "You are right,
Mr. Merwyn. There will be heavy fighting soon, and all the aid that you can give the Sanitary
and Christian Commissions will tend to save life and relieve suffering."

Under the circumstances he felt that he could not use any of the young man's money, even as
a temporary loan, although at times the employment of a few extra hundreds might aid him greatly
in his work.

Merwyn went away chilled and saddened anew, yet feeling that his reception had been all that
he had a right to expect.

There had been no lack of politeness on Mr. Vosburgh's part, but his manner had not been that
of a friend.

"He has recognized that I am under some secret restraint," Merwyn thought, "and distrusts me
at last. He probably thinks, with his daughter, that I am afraid to go. Oh that I had a chance
to prove that I am, at least, not a coward! In some way I shall prove it before many weeks pass."

At dinner, that evening, Mr. Vosburgh smiled significantly at Marian, and said, "Who do you
think called on me to-day?"

"Mr. Merwyn," she said, promptly.

"You are right. He came to offer--"

"Money," contemptuously completing her father's sentence.

"You evidently think you understand him. Perhaps you do; and I admit that I felt much as you
do, to-day, when he offered his purse to the cause. I fear, however, that we are growing a
little morbid on this subject, and inclined to judgments too severe. You and I have become
like so many in the South. This conflict and its results are everything to us, and we forget
that we are surrounded by hundreds of thousands who are loyal, but are not ready for very great
sacrifices."

"We are also surrounded by millions that are, and I cast in my lot with these. If this is to
be morbid, we have plenty of company."

"What I mean is, that we may be too hard upon those who do not feel, and perhaps are not capable
of feeling, as we do."

"O papa! you know the reason why Mr. Merwyn takes the course he does."

"I know what you think to be the reason, and you may be right. Your explanation struck me with
more force than ever to-day; and yet, looking into the young fellow's face, it seems impossible.
He impresses me strangely, and awakens much curiosity as to his future course. He asked if
he could call as usual, and I, with ordinary politeness, said, 'Certainly.' Indeed, there was
a dignity about the fellow that almost compelled the word. I don't know that we have any occasion
to regret it. He has done nothing to forfeit mere courtesy on our part."

"Oh, no," said Marian, discontentedly; "but he irritates me. I wish I had never known him,
and that I might never meet him again. I am more and more convinced that my theory about him
is correct, and while I pity him sincerely, the ever-present consciousness of his fatal defect
is more distressing--perhaps I should say, annoying--than if he presented some strong physical
deformity. He is such a superb and mocking semblance of a man that I cannot even think of him
without exasperation."

"Well, my dear, perhaps this is one of the minor sacrifices that we must make for the cause.
Until Merwyn can explain for himself, he has no right to expect from us more than politeness.
While I would not take from him a loan for my individual work, I can induce him to give much
material help. In aiding Strahan, and in other ways, he has done a great deal, and he is willing
to do more. The prospects are that everything will be needed, and I do not feel like alienating
one dollar or one bit of influence. According to your theory his course is due to infirmity
rather than to fault, and so he should be tolerated, since he is doing the best he can. Politeness
to him will not compromise either our principles or ourselves."

"Well, papa, I will do my best; but if he had a particle of my intuition he would know how
I feel. Indeed, I believe he does know in some degree, and it seems to me that, if I were a
man, I couldn't face a woman while she entertained such an opinion."

"Perhaps the knowledge that you are wrong enables him to face you."

"If that were true he wouldn't be twenty-four hours in proving it."

"Well," said her father, with a grim laugh, and in a low voice, "he may soon have a chance
to show his mettle without going to the front. Marian, I wish you would join your mother. The
city is fairly trembling with suppressed disloyalty. If Lee marches northward I shall fear
an explosion at any time."

"Leave the city!" said the young girl, hotly. "That would prove that I possess the same traits
that repel me so strongly in Mr. Merwyn.  No, I shall not leave your side this summer, unless
you compel me to almost by force. Have we not recently heard of two Southern girls who cheered
on their friends in battle with bullets flying around them? After witnessing that scene, I
should make a pitiable figure in Captain Lane's eyes should I seek safety in flight at the
mere thought of danger. I should die with shame."

"It is well Captain Lane does not hear you, or the surgeon would have fever to contend with,
as well as wounds."

"O dear!" cried the girl. "I wish we could hear from him."

Mr. Vosburgh had nearly reached the conclusion that if the captain survived the vicissitudes
of the war he would not plead a second time in vain.

A few evenings later Merwyn called. Mr. Vosburgh was out, and others were in the drawing-room.
Marian did not have much to say to him, but treated him with her old, distant politeness. He
felt her manner, and saw the gulf that lay between them, but no one unacquainted with the past
would have recognized any lack of courtesy on her part.

Among the exciting topics broached was the possibility of a counter-revolution at the North.
Merwyn noticed that Marian was reticent in regard to her father and his opinions, but he was
startled to hear her say that she would not be surprised if violent outbreaks of disloyalty
took place any hour, and he recognized her courage in remaining in the city. One of the callers,
an officer in the Seventh Regiment, also spoke of the possibility of all the militia being
ordered away to aid in repelling invasion.

Merwyn listened attentively, but did not take a very active part in the conversation, and went
away with the words "counter-revolution" and "invasion" ringing in his ears.

He became a close student of the progress of events, and, with his sensitiveness in regard
to the Vosburghs, adopted a measure that taxed his courage. A day or two later he called on
Mr. Vosburgh at his office, and asked him out to lunch, saying that he was desirous of obtaining
some information.

Mr. Vosburgh complied readily, for he wished to give the young man every chance to right himself,
and he could not disguise the fact that he felt a peculiar interest in the problem presented
by his daughter's unfortunate suitor. Merwyn was rather maladroit in accounting for his questions
in regard to the results of a counter revolution, and gave the impression that he was solicitous
about his property.

Convinced that his entertainer was loyal from conviction and feeling, as well as from the nature
of his pecuniary interests, Mr.  Vosburgh spoke quite freely of the dangerous elements rapidly
developing at the North, and warned his host that, in his opinion, the critical period of the
struggle was approaching. Merwyn's grave, troubled face and extreme reticence in respect to
his own course made an unfavorable impression, yet he was acting characteristically. Trammelled
as he was, he could not speak according to his natural impulses. He felt that brave words,
not enforced by corresponding action, would be in wretched taste, and his hope was that by
deeds he could soon redeem himself. If there was a counter-revolution he could soon find a
post of danger without wearing the uniform of a soldier or stepping on Southern soil, but he
was not one to boast of what he would do should such and such events take place. Moreover,
before the month elapsed he had reason to believe that he would receive a letter from his mother
giving him freedom. Therefore, Mr. Vosburgh was left with all his old doubts and perplexities
unrelieved, and Marian's sinister theory was confirmed rather than weakened.

Merwyn, however, was no longer despondent. The swift march of events might give him the opportunities
he craved. He was too young not to seize on the faintest hope offered by the future, and the
present period was one of reaction from the deep dejection that, for a time, had almost paralyzed
him in the country.

Even as a boy he had been a sportsman, and a good shot with gun, rifle, and pistol, but now
he began to perfect himself in the use of the last-named weapon. He arranged the basement of
his house in such a way that he could practise with his revolvers, and he soon became very
proficient in the accuracy and quickness of his aim.

According to the press despatches of the day, there was much uncertainty in regard to General
Lee's movements and plans. Mr. Vosburgh's means of information led him to believe that the
rebel army was coming North, and many others shared the fear; but as late as June 15, so skilfully
had the Confederate leader masked his purposes, that, according to the latest published news,
the indications were that he intended to cross the Rappahannock near Culpepper and inaugurate
a campaign similar to the one that had proved so disastrous to the Union cause the preceding
summer.

On the morning of the 16th, however, the head-lines of the leading journals startled the people
through the North. The rebel advance had occupied Chambersburg, Pa. The invasion was an accomplished
fact. The same journals contained a call from the President for 100,000 militia, of which the
State of New York was to furnish 20,000. The excitement in Pennsylvania was intense, for not
only her capital, but her principal towns and cities were endangered. The thick-flying rumors
of the past few days received terrible confirmation, and, while Lee's plans were still shrouded
in mystery, enough was known to awaken apprehension, while the very uncertainty proved the
prolific source of the most exaggerated and direful stories. There was immense activity at
the various armories, and many regiments of the city militia expected orders to depart at any
hour. The metropolis was rocking with excitement, and wherever men congregated there were eager
faces and excited tones.

Behind his impassive manner, when he appeared in the street, no one disguised deeper feeling,
more eager hope, more sickening fear, than Willard Merwyn. When would his mother's letter come?
If this crisis should pass and he take no part in it he feared that he himself would be lost.

Since his last call upon Marian he felt that he could not see her again until he could take
some decided course; but if there were blows to be struck by citizens at the North, or if his
mother's letter acceded to his wish, however grudgingly, he could act at once, and on each
new day he awoke with the hope that he might be unchained before its close.

The 17th of June was a memorable day. The morning press brought confirmation of Lee's northward
advance. The men of the Quaker City were turning out en masse, either to carry the musket or
for labor on fortifications, and it was announced that twelve regiments of the New-York militia
were under marching orders. The invasion was the one topic of conversation. There was an immense
revival of patriotism, and recruiting at the armories went on rapidly. At this outburst of
popular feeling disloyalty shrunk out of sight for a time, and apparently the invaders who
had come north as allies of the peace party created an uprising, as they had expected, but
it was hostile to them.

The people were reminded of the threats of the Southern leaders. The speech of Jeff Davis in
the winter of 1860-61 was quoted: "If war should result from secession, it will not be our
fields that will witness its ravages, but those of the North."

The fact that this prediction was already fulfilled stung even the half-hearted into action,
and nerved the loyalty of others, and when it became known that the gallant Seventh Regiment
would march down Broadway en route for Pennsylvania at noon, multitudes lined the thoroughfare
and greeted their defenders with acclamations.

Merwyn knew that Marian would witness the departure, and he watched in the distance till he
saw her emerge from her home and go to a building on Broadway in which her father had secured
her a place. She was attended by an officer clad in the uniform of a service so dear to her,
but which HE had sworn never to wear. He hastily secured a point of observation in a building
opposite, for while the vision of the young girl awakened almost desperate revolt at his lot,
he could not resist a lover's impulse to see her. Pale, silent, absorbed, he saw her wave her
handkerchief and smile at her friends as they passed; he saw a white-haired old lady reach
out her hands in yearning love, an eloquent pantomime that indicated that her sons were marching
under her eyes, and then she sank back into Marian's arms.

"Oh," groaned Merwyn, "if that were my mother I could give her a love that would be almost
worship."

CHAPTER XXXI.

"I'VE LOST MY CHANCE."

During the remainder of the 17th of June and for the next few days, the militia regiments of
New York and Brooklyn were departing for the seat of war. The city was filled with conflicting
rumors. On the 19th it was said that the invaders were returning to Virginia. The questions
"Where is Lee, and what are his purposes? and what is the army of the Potomac about?" were
upon all lips.

On the 20th came the startling tidings of organized resistance to the draft in Ohio, and of
troops fired upon by the mob. Mr. Vosburgh frowned heavily as he read the account at the breakfast-table
and said: "The test of my fears will come when the conscription begins in this city, and it
may come much sooner. I wish you to join your mother before that day, Marian!"

"No," she said, quietly,--"not unless you compel, me to."

"I may be obliged to use my authority," said her father, after some thought. "My mind is oppressed
by a phase of danger not properly realized. The city is being stripped of its loyal regiments,
and every element of mischief is left behind."

"Papa, I entreat you not to send me away while you remain. I assure you that such a course
would involve far greater danger to me than staying with you, even though your fears should
be realized. If the worst should happen, I might escape all harm. If you do what you threaten,
I could not escape a wounded spirit."

"Well, my dear," said her father, gently, "I appreciate your courage and devotion, and I should
indeed miss you. We'll await further developments."

Day after day passed, bringing no definite information. There were reports of severe cavalry
fighting in Virginia, but the position of the main body of Lee's army was still practically
unknown to the people at large. On the 22d, a leading journal said, "The public must, with
patience, await events in Virginia, and remain in ignorance until some decisive point is reached;"
and on the 24th, the head-lines of the press read, in effect, "Not much of importance from
Pennsylvania yesterday." The intense excitement caused by the invasion was subsiding. People
could not exist at the first fever-heat. It was generally believed that Hooker's army had brought
Lee to a halt, and that the two commanders were manoeuvring for positions. The fact was that
the Confederates had an abundance of congenial occupation in sending southward to their impoverished
commissary department the immense booty they were gathering among the rich farms and towns
of Pennsylvania. Hooker was seeking, by the aid of his cavalry force and scouts, to penetrate
his opponent's plans, meanwhile hesitating whether to fall on the rebel communications in their
rear, or to follow northward.

Lee and his great army, flushed with recent victories, were not all that Hooker had to contend
with, but there was a man in Washington, whose incapacity and ill-will threatened even more
fatal difficulties. Gen. Halleck, Commander-in-Chief, hung on the Union leader like the "Old
Man of the Sea." He misled the noble President, who, as a civilian. was ignorant of military
affairs, paralyzed tens of thousands of troops by keeping them where they could be of no practical
use, and by giving them orders of which General Hooker was not informed. The Comte de Paris
writes, "Lee's projects could not have been more efficiently subserved," and the disastrous
defeat of General Milroy confirms these words. It was a repetition of the old story of General
Miles of the preceding year, with the difference that Milroy was a gallant, loyal man, who
did all that a skilful officer could accomplish to avert the results of his superior's blundering
and negligence.

Hooker was goaded into resigning, and of the army of the Potomac the gifted French author again
writes, "Everything seemed to conspire against it, even the government, whose last hope it
was;" adding later: "Out of the 97,000 men thus divided (at Washington, Frederick, Fortress
Monroe, and neighboring points) there were 40,000, perfectly useless where they were stationed,
that might have been added to the army of the Potomac before the 1st of July. Thus reinforced,
the Union general could have been certain of conquering his adversary, and even of inflicting
upon him an irreparable disaster."

The fortunes of the North were indeed trembling in the balance. We had to cope with the ablest
general of the South and his great army, with the peace (?) faction that threatened bloody
arguments in the loyal States, and with General Halleck.

The people were asking: "Where is the army of the Potomac? What can it be doing, that the invasion
goes on so long unchecked?" At Gettysburg this patient, longsuffering army gave its answer.

Meanwhile the North was brought face to face with the direst possibilities, and its fears,
which history has proved to be just, were aroused to the last degree. The lull in the excitement
which had followed the first startling announcement of invasion was broken by the wildest rumors
and the sternest facts. The public pulse again rose to fever-heat. Farmers were flying into
Harrisburg, before the advancing enemy; merchants were packing their goods for shipment to
the North; and the panic was so general that the proposition was made to stop forcibly the
flight of able-bodied men from the Pennsylvanian capital.

As Mr. Vosburgh read these despatches in the morning paper, Marian smiled satirically, and
said: "You think that Mr. Merwyn is under some powerful restraint. I doubt whether he would
be restrained from going north, should danger threaten this city."

And many believed, with good reason, that New York City was threatened. Major-General Doubleday,
in his clear, vigorous account of this campaign writes: "Union spies who claimed to have counted
the rebel forces as they passed through Hagerstown made their number to be 91,000 infantry
and 280 guns. This statement, though exaggerated, gained great credence, and added to the excitement
of the loyal people throughout the Northern States, while the disloyal element was proportionately
active and jubilant."

These statements of sober history are but the true echoes of the loud alarms of the hour. On
the morning of the 20th of June, such words as these were printed as the leading editorial
of the New York Tribune: "The rebels are coming North. All doubt seems at length dispelled.
Men of the North, Pennsylvanians, Jerseymen, New-Yorkers, New-Englanders, the foe is at your
doors! Are you true men or traitors? brave men or cowards? If you are patriots, resolved and
deserving to be free, prove it by universal rallying, arming, and marching to meet the foe.
Prove it NOW!"

Marian, with flashing eyes and glowing cheeks, read to her father this brief trumpet call,
and then exclaimed: "Yes, the issue is drawn so sharply now that no loyal man can hesitate,
and to-day Mr.  Merwyn cannot help answering the question, 'Are you a brave man or a coward?'
O papa, to think that a MAN should be deaf to such an appeal and shrink in such an emergency!"

At that very hour Merwyn sat alone in his elegant home, his face buried in his hands, the very
picture of dejection. Before him on the table lay the journal from which he had read the same
words which Marian had applied to him in bitter scorn. An open letter was also upon the table,
and its contents had slain his hope. Mrs. Merwyn had answered his appeal characteristically. Now
to this objection it maybe answered, and very satisfactorily, "Is it then nothing toward convincing
us of the truth of the Gospel, that those whom we love best and reverence most believe it? Is it against
reason to think that they are right, who have considered the matter most deeply? Do we not receive
what they tell us in other matters, though we cannot prove the truth of their information; for
instance, in matters of art and science; why then is it irrational to believe them in religion
also? Have not the wisest and holiest of men been Christians? and have not unbelievers, on
the contrary, been very generally signal instances of pride, discontent,
and profligacy?

Again, are not the principles of unbelief certain to dissolve human
society? and is not this plain fact, candidly considered, enough to
show that unbelief cannot be a right condition of our nature? for
who can believe that we were intended to live in anarchy?

If we have no good reason for believing, at least we have no good reason for disbelieving. If
you ask why we are Christians, we ask in turn, Why should we not be Christians? it will be enough to remain
where we are, till you do what you never can do--prove to us for
certain, that the Gospel is not Divine; it is enough for us to be
on the side of good men, to be under the feet of the Saints, to 'go
our way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and to feed our kids
beside the shepherds' tent[1].'"

This would be quite a sufficient answer, had we nothing else to say;
but I will give another, and that in connexion with the text; I will
show you that the most unlearned Christian may have a very real and
substantial argument, an intimate token, of the truth of the Gospel,
quite independent of the authority of his parents and teachers; nay,
that were all the world, even were his teachers, to tell him that
religion was a dream, still he would have a good reason for believing
it true.

This reason, I say, is contained in the text--"I have more understanding than the aged, because
I keep Thy commandments." By obeying the commands of Scripture, we learn that these commands really
come from God; by trying we make proof; by doing we come to know.

Now how comes this to pass? It happens in several ways.

1. Consider the Bible tells us to be meek, humble, single-hearted,
and teachable. Now, it is plain that humility and teachableness are qualities
of mind necessary for arriving at the truth in any subject, and in
religious matters as well as others.

By obeying Scripture, then, in practising humility and teachableness,
it is evident we are at least in the way to arrive at the knowledge
of God.

On the other hand, impatient, proud, self-confident, obstinate men,
are generally wrong in the opinions they form of persons and things.

Prejudice and self-conceit blind the eyes and mislead the judgment, whatever be the subject inquired
into. For instance, how often do men mistake the characters and misconstrue the actions of others!
how often are they deceived in them! how often do the young form
acquaintances injurious to their comfort and good! how often do men
embark in foolish and ruinous schemes! how often do they squander
their money, and destroy their worldly prospects!

And what, I ask, is so frequent a cause of these many errors as wilfulness and presumption? The same
thing happens also in religious inquiries. When I see a person hasty and violent, harsh and
high-minded, careless of what others feel, and disdainful of what
they think,--when I see such a one proceeding to inquire into religious
subjects, I am sure beforehand he cannot go right--he will not be
led into all the truth--it is contrary to the nature of things and
the experience of the world, that he should find what he is seeking.

I should say the same were he seeking to find out what to believe or do in any other matter
not religious,--but especially in any such important and solemn inquiry; for the fear of the
Lord (humbleness, teachableness, reverence towards Him) is the very beginning of wisdom, as
Solomon tells us; it leads us to think over things modestly and honestly,
to examine patiently, to bear doubt and uncertainty, to wait perseveringly
for an increase of light, to be slow to speak, and to be deliberate
in deciding.

2. Consider, in the next place, that those who are trained carefully
according to the precepts of Scripture, gain an elevation, a delicacy,
refinement, and sanctity of mind, which is most necessary for judging
fairly of the truth of Scripture.

A man who loves sin does not wish the Gospel to be true, and therefore
is not a fair judge of it; a mere man of the world, a selfish and
covetous man, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, is, from a sense of
interest, against that Bible which condemns him, and would account
that man indeed a messenger of good tidings of peace who could prove
to him that Christ's doctrine was not from God.

I do not mean to say that such men necessarily reject the word of God, as if we could dare to
conclude that all who do not reject it are therefore sure to be not covetous, drunkards, extortioners,
and the like; for it is often a man's interest not openly to reject it, though it be against him;
and the bulk of men are inconsistent, and have some good feelings left, even amid their sins and
vices, which keep them from going all lengths. But, while they still
profess to honour, at least they try to pervert and misinterpret
Scripture, and that comes to the same thing.

They try to persuade themselves that Christ will save them, though they continue in sin; or they wish
to believe that future punishment will not last for ever; or they conceive that their good deeds
or habits, few and miserable as they are at best, will make up for
the sins of which they are too conscious.

Whereas such men as have been taught betimes to work with God their
Saviour--in ruling their hearts, and curbing their sinful passions,
and changing their wills--though they are still sinners, have not
within them that treacherous enemy of the truth which misleads the
judgments of irreligious men.

Here, then, are two very good reasons at first sight, why men who obey the
Scripture precepts are more likely to arrive at religious truth, than
those who neglect them; first, because such men are teachable men;
secondly, because they are pure in heart; such shall see God, whereas
the proud provoke His anger, and the carnal are His abhorrence.

But to proceed. Consider, moreover, that those who try to obey God evidently
gain a knowledge of themselves at least; and this may be shown to
be the first and principal step towards knowing God.

For let us suppose a child, under God's blessing, profiting by his teacher's guidance, and
trying to do his duty and please God. He will perceive that there
is much in him which ought not to be in him.

His own natural sense of right and wrong tells him that peevishness,
sullenness, deceit, and self-will, are tempers and principles of
which he has cause to be ashamed, and he feels that these bad tempers
and principles are in his heart.

As he grows older, he will understand this more and more. Wishing,
then, and striving to act up to the law of conscience, he will yet
find that, with his utmost efforts, and after his most earnest prayers,
he still falls short of what he knows to be right, and what he aims
at.

Conscience, however, being respected, will become a more powerful and
enlightened guide than before; it will become more refined and hard to
please; and he will understand and perceive more clearly the distance
that exists between his own conduct and thoughts, and perfection.

He will admire and take pleasure in the holy law of God, of which
he reads in Scripture; but he will be humbled withal, as understanding
himself to be a continual transgressor against it.

Thus he will learn from experience the doctrine of original sin, before he knows the actual name
of it. I know that in my flesh dwelleth no good thing[3]." The effect
of this experience will be to make him take it for granted, as an
elementary truth, that he cannot gain heaven for himself; to make
him feel himself guilty before God; and to feel, moreover, that even
were he admitted into the Divine presence, yet, till his heart be
(so to say) made over again, he cannot perfectly enjoy God.

This, surely, is the state of self-knowledge; these are the convictions
to which every one is brought on, who attempts honestly to obey the
precepts of God. I do not mean that all that I have been saying will
necessarily pass through his mind, and in the same order, or that
he will be conscious of it, or be able to speak of it, but that on
the whole thus he will feel.

When, then, even an unlearned person thus trained--from his own heart,
from the action of his mind upon itself, from struggles with self, from
an attempt to follow those impulses of his own nature which he feels
to be highest and noblest, from a vivid natural perception (natural,
though cherished and strengthened by prayer, natural, though unfolded and diversified
by practice, natural, though of that new and second nature which God
the Holy Ghost gives), from an innate, though supernatural perception
of the great vision of Truth which is external to him (a perception
of it, not indeed in its fulness, but in glimpses, and by fits and seasons,
and in its persuasive influences, and through a courageous following
on after it, as a man in the dark might follow after some dim and distant
light)--I say, when a person thus trained from his own heart, reads the
declarations and promises of the Gospel, are we to be told that he
believes in them merely because he has been bid believe in them?

Do we not see he has besides this a something in his own breast which bears a confirming testimony
to their truth?

He reads that the heart is "deceitful above all things and desperately
wicked[4]," and that he inherits an evil nature from Adam, and that
he is still under its power, except so far as he has been renewed.

Here is a mystery; but his own actual and too bitter experience bears
witness to the truth of the declaration; he feels the mystery of iniquity
within him. He reads, that "without holiness no man shall see the Lord[5];"
and his own love of what is true and lovely and pure, approves and embraces
the doctrine as coming from God.

He reads, that God is angry at sin, and will punish the sinner, and that
it is a hard matter, nay, an impossibility, for us to appease His wrath.
Here, again, is a mystery: but here, too, his conscience anticipates
the mystery, and convicts him; his mouth is stopped.

And when he goes on to read that the Son of God has Himself come into
the world in our flesh, and died upon the Cross for us, does he not,
amid the awful mysteriousness of the doctrine, find those words fulfilled
in him which that gracious Saviour uttered, "And I, if I be lifted
up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me"?

He cannot choose but believe in Him. He says, "O Lord, Thou art stronger
than I, and hast prevailed."

Here then, I say, he surely possesses an evidence perfectly distinct from the authority
of superiors and teachers; like St. Paul, he is in one way not taught of
men, "but by the revelation of Jesus Christ[6]." Others have but bid him
look within, and pray for God's grace to be enabled to know himself; and the
more he understands his own heart, the more are the Gospel doctrines recommended
to his reason. He is assured that Christ does not speak of Himself,
but that His word is from God. He is ready, with the Samaritan woman,
to say to all around him, "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever
I did: is not this the Christ[7]?" Or, again, in the words which the
Samaritans of the same city used to the woman after conversing with Christ;
"Now we believe, not because of thy saying" (not merely on the authority
of friends and relatives), "for we have heard Him ourselves, and
know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world."

The Bible, then, seems to say,--God is not a hard master to require belief,
without affording grounds for believing; only follow your own sense
of right, and you will gain from that very obedience to your Maker,
which natural conscience enjoins, a conviction of the truth and power
of that Redeemer whom a supernatural message has revealed; do but examine
your thoughts and doings; do but attempt what you know to be God's
will, and you will most assuredly be led on into all the truth: you will recognize
the force, meaning, and awful graciousness of the Gospel Creed; you will
bear witness to the truth of one doctrine, by your own past experience
of yourselves; of another, by seeing that it is suited to your necessity;
of a third, by finding it fulfilled upon your obeying it.

My brethren, it is always reasonable to insist upon these subjects;
but it is peculiarly so in times when a spirit of presumptuous doubting
is in many places abroad. As many of us as live in the world must expect
to hear our faith despised, and our conscientious obedience ridiculed;
we must expect to be taunted and scorned by those who find it much
easier to attack another's creed than to state their own.

A little learning is a dangerous thing. When men think they know more than others, they often
talk for the sake of talking, or to show their ability (as they think),
their shrewdness and depth; and they speak lightly of the All-Holy
God, to gratify their empty self-conceit and vanity.

And often it answers no purpose to dispute with such persons; for not having been trained up to
obey their conscience, to restrain their passions, and examine their hearts, they will assent
to nothing you can say; they will be questioning and arguing about every thing; they have no common
ground with you, and when they talk of religion they are like blind persons talking of colours. If
you urge how great a gift it is to be at peace with God, or of the arduousness and yet desirableness
of perfection, or the beauty of saintliness, or the dangerousness
of the world, or the blessedness of self-control, or the glory of virginity,
or the answers which God gives to prayer, or the marvellousness and almost
miraculousness of His providences, or the comfort of religion in affliction,
or the strength given you over your passions in the Most Holy Sacrament,
such persons understand you not at all.

They will laugh, they will scoff, at best they will wonder: any how
what you say is no evidence to them.

You
cannot convince them, because you differ from them in first principles; it is not that they start from the same
point as you, and afterwards strike off in some wayward direction; but their
course is altogether distinct, they have no point in common with you.

For such persons then you can only pray; God alone can bring down pride, self-conceit, an arrogant spirit,
a presumptuous temper; God alone can dissipate prejudice; God alone
can overcome flesh and blood.

Useful as argument may be for converting a man, in such cases God
seldom condescends to employ it.

Yet,
let not such vain or ignorant reasoners convert you to unbelief in
great matters or little; let them not persuade you, that your faith
is built on the mere teaching of fallible men; do not you be ridiculed
out of your confidence and hope in Christ.

You may, if you will, have an inward witness arising from obedience:
and though you cannot make them see it, you can see it yourselves, which
is the great thing; and it will be quite sufficient, with God's blessing,
to keep you stedfast in the way of life.

Lastly, let me remark how dangerous their state is who are content
to take the truths of the Gospel on trust, without caring whether
or not those truths are realized in their own heart and conduct.

Such men, when assailed by ridicule and sophistry, are likely to fall; they have no root in themselves; and
let them be quite sure, that should they fall away from the faith, it will be a slight thing at the
last day to plead that subtle arguments were used against them, that
they were altogether unprepared and ignorant, and that their seducers
prevailed over them by the display of some little cleverness and human
knowledge. The inward witness to the truth lodged in our hearts is a
match for the most learned infidel or sceptic that ever lived: though,
to tell the truth, such men are generally very shallow and weak, as well
as wicked; generally know only a little, pervert what they know, assume
false principles, and distort or suppress facts: but were they as accomplished
as the very author of evil, the humblest Christian, armed with sling
and stone, and supported by God's unseen might, is, as far as his
own faith is concerned, a match for them.

And, on the other hand, the most acute of reasoners and most profound
of thinkers, the most instructed in earthly knowledge, is nothing, except
he has also within him the presence of the Spirit of truth.

Human knowledge, though of great power when joined to a pure and
humble faith, is of no power when opposed to it, and, after ail, for
the comfort of the individual Christian, it is of little value.

May we, then, all grow in heavenly knowledge, and, with that end, labour
to improve what is already given us, be it more or be it less, knowing
that "he that is faithful in little is faithful also in much," and
that "to him that hath, more shall be given."

The Prophets were ever ungratefully treated by the Israelites, they
were resisted, their warnings neglected, their good services forgotten.

But there was this difference between the earlier and the later Prophets; the earlier lived and died in
honour among their people,--in outward honour; though hated and
thwarted by the wicked, they were exalted to high places, and ruled
in the congregation.

Moses, for instance, was in trouble from his people all his life long, but to the end he was
their lawgiver and judge. But in the latter times, the prophets
were not only feared and hated by the enemies of God, but cast out of
the vineyard.

As the time approached for the coming of the true Prophet of the Church, the Son of God, they resembled
Him in their earthly fortunes more and more; and as He was to suffer,
so did they. Moses was a ruler, Jeremiah was an outcast: Samuel was
buried in peace, John the Baptist was beheaded.

Of these, Elijah, who lived in the wilderness, and the hundred prophets whom
Obadiah fed by fifty in a cave, are examples of the wanderers. And
Micaiah, who was appointed the bread of affliction and the water of affliction
by an idolatrous king, is the specimen of those who "had trial of
bonds and imprisonment."

Of those
who were sawn asunder and slain with the sword, Isaiah is the chief, who,
as tradition goes, was by order of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, sawn
asunder with a wooden saw. And of those who were stoned, none is more famous
than Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, "who was slain between the temple
and the altar[3]."

But of all the persecuted prophets Jeremiah is the most eminent;
i. e. we know more of his history, of his imprisonments, his wanderings,
and his afflictions.

He may be taken as a representative of the Prophets; and hence it is that he is an especial type of our
Lord and Saviour. All the Prophets were types of the Great Prophet whose way they were preparing;
they tended towards and spoke of Christ. In their sufferings they foreshadowed
His priesthood, and in their teaching His prophetical office, and in their
miracles His royal power. The history of Jeremiah, then, as being drawn out
in Scripture more circumstantially than that of the other Prophets, is
the most exact type of Christ among them; that is, next to David,
who, of course, was the nearest resemblance to Him of all, as a sufferer,
an inspired teacher, and a king.

Jeremiah comes next to David; I do not say in dignity and privilege, for
it was Elijah who was taken up to heaven, and appeared at the Transfiguration;
nor in inspiration, for to Isaiah one should assign the higher evangelical
gifts; but in typifying Him who came and wept over Jerusalem, and then
was tortured and put to death by those He wept over. And hence, when
our Lord came, while some thought Him Elijah, and others John the
Baptist, risen from the dead, there were others who thought Him Jeremiah.
Of Jeremiah, then, I will now speak, as a specimen of all those Prophets
whom St. Paul sets before us as examples of faith, and St. James as
examples of patience. Jeremiah's ministry may be summed up in three
words, good hope, labour, disappointment.

It was his privilege to
be called to his sacred office from his earliest years. Like Samuel,
the first prophet, he was of the tribe of Levi, dedicated from his
birth to religious services, and favoured with the constant presence
and grace of God. "Before I formed thee . . . This commission was
given the year after Josiah began his reformation. Jeremiah returned
for answer, "Ah! Lord God! behold, I cannot speak; for I am a child."
He felt the arduousness of a prophet's office; the firmness and intrepidity
which were required to speak the words of God.

"I am sorry indeed to tell you that I do not know," Blauvelt replied, sadly. Then he hastily
added: "But I am sure he was not killed, for I have searched every part of the field where
he could possibly have fallen. I have visited the hospitals, and have spent days and nights
in inquiries. My belief now is that he was taken prisoner."

"Then there is still hope!" exclaimed the young girl, with tears in her eyes. "You surely believe
there is still hope?"

"I certainly believe there is much reason for hope. The rebels left their own seriously wounded
men on the field, and took away as prisoners only such of our men as were able to march. It
is true I saw Strahan fall just as we were driven back; but I am sure that he was neither killed
nor seriously wounded, for I went to the spot as soon as possible afterwards and he was not
there, nor have I been able, since, to find him or obtain tidings of him. He may have been
knocked down by a piece of shell or a spent ball. A moment or two later the enemy charged over
the spot where he fell, and what was left of our regiment was driven back some distance. From
that moment I lost all trace of him. I believe that he has only been captured with many other
prisoners, and that he will be exchanged in a few weeks."

"Heaven grant that it may be so!" she breathed, fervently. "But, Mr.  Blauvelt, YOU are wounded.
Do not think us indifferent because we have asked so eagerly after Major Strahan, for you are
here alive and apparently as undaunted as ever."

"Oh, my wounds are slight. Carrying my arm in a sling gives too serious an impression. I merely
had one of the fingers of my left hand shot away, and a scratch on my shoulder."

"But have these wounds been dressed lately?" Mr. Vosburgh asked, gravely.

"And have you had your rations this evening?" Marian added, with the glimmer of a smile.

"Thanks, yes to both questions. I arrived this afternoon, and at once saw a good surgeon. I
have not taken time to obtain a better costume than this old uniform, which has seen hard service."

"Like the wearer," said Marian. "I should have been sorry indeed if you had changed it."

"Well, I knew that you would be anxious to have even a negative assurance of Strahan's safety."

"And equally so to be positively assured of your own."

"I hoped that that would be true to some extent. My dear old mother, in New Hampshire, to whom
I have telegraphed, is eager to see me, and so I shall go on in the morning."

"You must be our guest, then, to-night," said Mr. Vosburgh, decisively. "We will take no refusal,
and I shall send at once to the hotel for your luggage."

"It is small indeed," laughed Blauvelt, flushing with pleasure, "for I came away in very light
marching order."

Marian then explained that Merwyn, who, after a brief, polite greeting from Blauvelt, had been
almost forgotten, was about to start in search of Strahan.

"I would not lay a straw in his way, and possibly he may obtain some clue that escaped me,"
said the young officer.

"Perhaps, if you feel strong enough to tell us something of that part of the battle in which
you were engaged, and of your search, Mr. Merwyn may receive hints which will be of service
to him," Mr. Vosburgh suggested.

"I shall be very glad to do so, and feel entirely equal to the effort. Indeed, I have been
resting and sleeping in the cars nearly all day, and am so much better that I scarcely feel
it right to be absent from the regiment."

They at once repaired to the library, Marian leaving word with Mammy Borden that they were
engaged, should there be other callers.

CHAPTER XXXIII.

A GLIMPSE OF WAR.

"Captain Blauvelt," said Marian, when they were seated in the library, "I have two favors to
ask of you. First, that you will discontinue your story as soon as you feel the least weakness,
and, second, that you will not gloss anything over. I wish a life-picture of a soldier's experience.
You and Mr. Strahan have been inclined to give me the brighter side of campaigning. Now, tell
us just what you and Mr. Strahan did. I've no right to be the friend of soldiers if I cannot
listen to the tragic details of a battle, while sitting here in this quiet room, and I wish
to realize, as I never have done, what you and others have passed through. Do not be so modest
that you cannot tell us exactly what you did. In brief, a plain, unvarnished tale unfold, and
I shall be content."

"Now," she thought, "Mr. Merwyn shall know to whom I can give my friendship. I do not ask him,
or any one, to face these scenes, but my heart is for a man who can face them."

Blauvelt felt that he was fortunate indeed. He knew that he had fair powers as a raconteur,
and he was conscious of having taken no unworthy part in the events he was about to describe,
while she, who required the story, was the woman whom he most admired, and whose good opinion
was dear to him.

Therefore, after a moment's thought, he began: "In order to give you a quiet, and therefore
a more artistic prelude to the tragedy of the battle, I shall touch lightly on some of the
incidents of our march to the field. I will take up the thread of our experiences on the 15th
of June, for I think you were quite well informed of what occurred before that date. The 15th
was one of the hottest days that I remember. I refer to this fact because of a pleasant incident
which introduces a little light among the shadows, and suggests that soldiers are not such
bad fellows after all, although inclined to be a little rough and profane. Our men suffered
terribly from the heat, and some received sunstrokes. Many were obliged to fall out of the
ranks, but managed to keep up with the column. At noon we were halted near a Vermont regiment
that had just drawn a ration of soft bread and were boiling their coffee. As our exhausted
men came straggling and staggering in, these hospitable Vermonters gave them their entire ration
of bread and the hot coffee prepared for their own meal; and when the ambulances brought in
the men who had been sun-struck, these generous fellows turned their camp into a temporary
hospital and themselves into nurses.

"I will now give you a glimpse of a different experience. Towards evening on the 19th a rain-storm
began, and continued all night. No orders to halt came till after midnight. On we splashed,
waded, and floundered along roads cut up by troops in advance until the mud in many places
reached the depth of ten inches. It was intensely dark, and we could not see to pick our way.
Splashed from head to foot, and wet through for hours, we had then one of the most dismal experiences
I remember. I had not been well since the terrible heat of the 15th, and Strahan, putting on
the air of a martinet, sternly ordered me to mount his horse while he took charge of my company."

Marian here clapped her hands in applause.

"At last we were ordered to file to the right into a field and bivouac for the night. The field
proved to be a marshy meadow, worse than the road. But there was no help for it, and we were
too tired to hunt around in the darkness for a better place. Strahan mounted again to assist
in giving orders for the night's arrangement, and to find drier ground if possible. In the
darkness he and his horse tumbled into a ditch so full of mire and water that he escaped all
injury. We sank half-way to our knees in the swampy ground, and the horses floundered so that
one or two of the officers were thrown, and all were obliged to dismount. At last, by hallooing,
the regiment formed into line, and then came the unique order from the colonel, 'Squat, my
bull-frogs.' There was nothing for us to do but to lie down on the swampy, oozing ground, with
our shelter tents and blankets wrapped around and under us. You remember what an exquisite
Strahan used to be. I wish you could have seen him when the morning revealed us to one another.
He was of the color of the sacred soil from crown to toe. When we met we stood and laughed
at each other, and I wanted him to let me make a sketch for your benefit, but we hadn't time.

"I will now relate a little incident which shows how promptly pluck and character tell. During
the 25th we were pushed forward not far from thirty miles. On the morning of this severe march
a young civilian officer, who had been appointed to the regiment by the Governor, joined us,
and was given command of Company I. When he took his place in the march there was a feeling
of intense hostility toward him, as there ever is among veterans against civilians who are
appointed over them. If he had fallen out of the ranks and died by the roadside I scarcely
believe that a man would have volunteered to bury him. But, while evidently unaccustomed to
marching, he kept at the head of his company throughout the entire day, when every step must
have been torture. He uttered not a word of complaint, and at night was seen, by the light
of a flaring candle, pricking the blisters on his swollen feet; then he put on his shoes, and
walked away as erect as if on parade. In those few hours he had won the respect of the entire
regiment, and had become one of us. Poor fellow! I may as well mention now that he was killed,
a few days later, with many of the company that he was bravely leading. His military career
lasted but little over a week, yet he proved himself a hero.

"Now I will put in a few high lights again. On the 28th we entered Frederick City. Here we
had a most delightful experience. The day was warm and all were thirsty. Instead of the cold,
lowering glances to which we had been accustomed in Virginia, smiling mothers, often accompanied
by pretty daughters, stood in the gateways with pails and goblets of cool, sparkling water.
I doubt whether the same number of men ever drank so much water before, for who could pass
by a white hand and arm, and a pretty, sympathetic face, beaming with good-will? Here is a
rough sketch I made of a Quaker matron, with two charming daughters, and an old colored man,
'totin'' water at a rate that must have drained their well."

Marian praised the sketch so heartily that Merwyn knew she was taking this indirect way to
eulogize the soldier as as well as the artist, and he groaned inwardly as he thought how he
must suffer by contrast.

"I will pass over what occurred till the 1st of July. Our march lay through a country that,
after desolated Virginia, seemed like paradise, and the kind faces that greeted us were benedictions.
July 1st was clear, and the sun's rays dazzling and intense in their heat. Early in the afternoon
we were lying around in the shade, about two miles from the State line of Pennsylvania. Two
corps had preceded us. Some of our men, with their ears on the ground, declared that they could
hear the distant mutter of artillery. The country around was full of troops, resting like ourselves.

"Suddenly shrill bugle-blasts in every direction called us into line. We were moved through
Emmetsburg, filed to the left into a field until other troops passed, and then took our place
in the column and began a forced march to Gettysburg. Again we suffered terribly from the heat
and the choking clouds of dust raised by commands in advance of us. The sun shone in the west
like a great, angry furnace. Our best men began to stagger from the ranks and fall by the wayside,
while every piece of woods we passed was filled with prostrate men, gasping, and some evidently
dying. But on, along that white, dusty road, the living torrent poured. Only one command was
heard. 'Forward! Forward!'

"First, like a low jar of thunder, but with increasing volume and threatening significance,
the distant roar of artillery quickened the steps of those who held out. Major Strahan was
again on his feet, with other officers, their horses loaded down with the rifles of the men.
Even food and blankets, indeed almost everything except ammunition, was thrown away by the
men, for, in the effort to reach the field in time, an extra pound became an intolerable burden.

"At midnight we were halted on what was then the extreme left of Meade's position. When we
formed our regimental line, as usual, at the close of the day, not over one hundred men and
but five or six officers were present. Over one hundred and fifty had given out from the heat
and fatigue. The moment ranks were broken the men threw themselves down in their tracks and
slept with their loaded guns by their sides. Strahan and I felt so gone that we determined
to have a little refreshment if possible. Lights were gleaming from a house not far away, and
we went thither in the hope of purchasing something that would revive us. We found the building,
and even the yard around it, full of groaning and desperately wounded men, with whom the surgeons
were busy. This foretaste of the morrow took away our appetites, and we returned to our command,
where Strahan was soon sleeping, motionless, as so many of our poor fellows would be on the
ensuing night.

"Excessive fatigue often takes from me the power to sleep, and I lay awake, listening to the
strange, ominous sounds off to our right. There were the heavy rumble of artillery wheels,
the tramp of men, and the hoarse voices of officers giving orders. In the still night these
confused sounds were wonderfully distinct near at hand, but they shaded off in the northeast
to mere murmurs. I knew that it was the army of the Potomac arriving and taking its positions.
The next day I learned that General Meade had reached the field about one A.M., and that he
had spent the remaining hours of the night in examining the ground and in making preparations
for the coming struggle. The clear, white moonlight, which aided him in his task, lighted up
a scene strange and beautiful beyond words. It glinted on our weapons, gave to the features
of the sleepers the hue of death, and imparted to Strahan's face, who lay near me, almost the
delicacy and beauty of a girl. I declare to you, that when I remembered the luxurious ease
from which he had come, the hero he was now, and all his many acts of kindness to me and others,--when
I thought of what might be on the morrow, I'm not ashamed to say that tears came into my eyes."

"Nor am I ashamed," faltered Marian, "that you should see tears in mine. Oh, God grant that
he may return to us again!"

"Well," resumed Blauvelt, after a moment of thoughtful hesitation, "I suppose I was a little
morbid that night. Perhaps one was excusable, for all knew that we were on the eve of the most
desperate battle of the war. I shall not attempt to describe the beauty of the landscape, or
the fantastic shapes taken by the huge boulders that were scattered about. My body seemed almost
paralyzed with fatigue, but my mind, for a time, was preternaturally active, and noted every
little detail. Indeed, I felt a strange impulse to dwell upon and recall everything relating
to this life, since the chances were so great that we might, before the close of another day,
enter a different state of existence. You see I am trying, as you requested, to give you a
realistic picture."

"That is what I wish," said the young girl; but her cheeks were pale as she spoke.

"In the morning I was awakened by one of my men bringing me a cup of hot coffee, and when I
had taken it, and later a little breakfast of raw pork and hard-tack, I felt like a new man.
Nearly all of our stragglers had joined us during the night, or in the dawn, and our regiment
now mustered about two hundred and forty rifles in line, a sad change from the time when we
marched a thousand strong. But the men now were veterans, and this almost made good the difference.

"When the sun was a few hours high we were moved forward with the rest of our brigade; then,
later, off to the left, and placed in position on the brow of a hill that descended steeply
before us, and was covered with rocks, huge boulders, and undergrowth. The right of our regiment
was in the edge of a wood with a smoother slope before it. I and my company had no other shelter
than the rocks and boulders, which formed a marked feature of the locality, and protruded from
the soil in every imaginable shape. If we had only thrown the smaller stones together and covered
them with earth we might have made, during the time we wasted, a line of defence from which
we could not have been driven. The 2d of July taught us that we had still much to learn. As
it was, we lounged about upon the grass, seeking what shade we could from the glare of another
intensely hot day, and did nothing.

"A strange, ominous silence pervaded the field for hours, broken only now and then by a shell
screaming through the air, and the sullen roar of the gun from which it was fired. The pickets
along our front would occasionally approach the enemy too closely, and there would be brief
reports of musketry, again followed by oppressive silence. A field of wheat below us undulated
in light billows as the breeze swept it. War and death would be its reapers.  The birds were
singing in the undergrowth; the sun lighted up the rural landscape brilliantly, and it was
almost impossible to believe that the scenes of the afternoon could, take place. By sweeping
our eyes up and down our line, and by resting them upon a battery of our guns but a few yards
away, we became aware of the significance of our position. Lee's victorious army was before
us. Sinister rumors of the defeat of Union forces the previous day had reached us, and we knew
that the enemy's inaction did not indicate hesitation or fear, but rather a careful reconnaissance
of our lines, that the weakest point might be discovered. Every hour of delay, however, was
a boon to us, for the army of the Potomac was concentrating and strengthening its position.

"We were on the extreme left of the Union army; and, alas for us! Lee first decided to turn
and crush its left. As I have said, we were posted along the crest of a hill which sloped off
a little to the left, then rose again, and culminated in a wild, rocky elevation called the
Devil's Den,--fit name in view of the scenes it witnessed. Behind us was a little valley through
which flowed a small stream called Plum Run. Here the artillery horses, caissons, and wagons
were stationed, that they might be in partial shelter. Across the Run, and still further back,
rose the rocky, precipitous heights of Little Round Top, where, during the same afternoon,
some of the severest fighting of the battle is said to have taken place.  Please give me a
sheet of paper, and I can outline the nature of the ground just around us. Of the general battle
of that day I can give you but a slight idea. One engaged in a fight sees, as a rule, only
a little section of it; but in portraying that he gives the color and spirit of the whole thing."

Rapidly sketching for a few minutes, Blauvelt resumed: "Here we are along the crest of this
hill, with a steep, broken declivity in front of us, extending down a few hundred yards to
another small stream, a branch of Plum Run. Beyond this branch the ground rises again to some
thick woods, which screened the enemy's movements.

"At midday clouds of dust were seen rising in the distance, and we at last were told that Sedgwick's
corps had arrived, and that the entire army of the Potomac was on the ground. As hours still
elapsed and no attack was made, the feeling of confidence grew stronger. Possibly Lee had concluded
that our position was unassailable, or something had happened. The soldier's imagination was
only second to his credulity in receiving the rumors which flew as thick as did the bullets
a little later.

"Strahan and I had a quiet talk early in the day, and said what we wished to each other. After
that he became dreamy and absorbed in his own thoughts as we watched for signs of the enemy
through hours that seemed interminable. Some laughing, jesting, and card-playing went on among
the men, but in the main they were grave, thoughtful, and alert, spending the time in discussing
the probabilities of this conflict, and in recalling scenes of past battles.

"Suddenly--it could not have been much past three o'clock--a dozen rebel batteries opened upon
us, and in a second we were in a tempest of flying, bursting shells. Our guns, a few yards
away, and other batteries along our line, replied. The roar of the opening battle thundered
away to the right as far as we could hear. We were formed into line at once, and lay down upon
the ground. A few of our men were hit, however, and frightful wounds were inflicted. After
this iron storm had raged for a time we witnessed a sight that I shall never forget. Emerging
from the woods on the slope opposite to us, solid bodies of infantry, marching by columns of
battalion, came steadily toward us, their bayonets scintillating in the sunlight as if aflame.
On they came till they crossed the little stream before us, and then deployed into four distinct
lines of battle as steadily as if on parade. It was hard to realize that those men were marching
towards us in the bright sunlight with deadly intent. Heretofore, in Virginia, the enemy had
been partially screened in his approaches, but now all was like a panorama spread before us.
We could see our shells tearing first through their column, then through the lines of battle,
making wide gaps and throwing up clouds of dust. A second later the ranks were closed again,
and, like a dark tide, on flowed their advance.

"We asked ourselves, 'What chance have our thin ranks against those four distinct, heavy battle
lines advancing to assault us?' We had but two ranks of men, they eight. But not a man in our
regiment flinched. When the enemy reached the foot of the hill our cannon could not be so depressed
as to harm them. The time had come for the more deadly small arms. After a momentary halt the
Confederates rushed forward to the assault with loud yells.

"Strahan's face was flushed with excitement and ardor. He hastened to the colonel on the right
of the line and asked him to order a charge. The colonel coolly and quietly told him to go
back to his place. A crash of musketry and a line of fire more vivid than July sunshine breaks
out to the right and left as far as we can hear. Our men are beginning to fall. Again the impetuous
Strahan hastens to the colonel and entreats for the order to charge, but our commander, as
quiet and as impassive as the boulder beside which he stands, again orders him back. A moment
later, however, their horses are brought, and they mount in spite of my remonstrances and those
of other officers. Strahan's only answer was, "The men must see us to-day;" and he slowly rode
to the rear and centre of the regiment, wheeled his horse, and, with drawn sword, fixed his
eyes on the colonel, awaiting his signal. Supreme as was the moment of excitement, I looked
for a few seconds at my gallant friend, for I wished to fix his portrait at that moment forever
in my mind."

"Merciful Heaven!" said Marian, in a choking voice, "I thought I appreciated my friends before,
but I did not."

Mr. Vosburgh's eyes rested anxiously on his daughter, and he asked, gravely, "Marian, is it
best for you to hear more of this to-night?"

"Yes, papa. I must hear it all, and not a detail must be softened or omitted. Moreover," she
added, proudly, dashing her tears right and left, "I am not afraid to listen."

Merwyn had shifted his seat, and was in deep shadow. He was pale and outwardly impassive, but
there was torture in his mind. She thought, pityingly, "In spite of my tears I have a stouter
heart than he."

CHAPTER XXXIV.

A GLIMPSE OF WAR, CONTINUED.

"Miss Marian," resumed Blauvelt, "the scenes I am now about to describe are terrible in the
extreme, even in their baldest statement. I cannot portray what actually took place; I doubt
whether any one could; I can only give impressions of what I saw and heard when nearly all
of us were almost insane from excitement.  There are men who are cool in battle,--our colonel
was, outwardly,--but the great majority of men must be not only veterans, but also gifted with
unusual temperaments, to be able to remain calm and well balanced in the uproar of a bloody battle.

"In a sense, our men were veterans, and were steady enough to aim carefully as the enemy advanced
up the steep hill. Our shots told on them more fatally than theirs on us. The greater number
of us shared Strahan's impatience, and we longed for the wild, forward dash, which is a relief
to the tremendous nervous strain at such a time.  After a moment or two, that seemed ages,
the colonel quietly nodded to Strahan, who waved his sword, pointed towards the enemy, and
shouted, 'Charge!'

"You know him well enough to be sure that this was not an order for the men to fulfil while
he looked on. In a second his powerful bay sprung through the centre of our line, and to keep
up with him we had to follow on a run. There was no hesitation or flagging. Faces that had
been pale were flushed now. As I turned my eyes from moment to moment back to my company, the
terrible expression of the men's eyes impressed me even then. The colonel watched our impetuous
rush with proud satisfaction, and then spurred his horse to the very midst of our advance.
The lieutenant-colonel, undaunted by a former wound, never flinched a second, but wisely fought
on foot.

"The first battle-line of the enemy seemed utterly unable to stand before our fierce onset.
Those who were not shot fled.

"Again I saw Strahan waving his sword and shouting; 'Victory! Forward, men! forward!'

"He was in the very van, leading us all. At this moment the second rebel line fired a volley,
and the bullets swept by like an autumn gust through a tree from which the leaves, thinned
by former gales, are almost stripped. It seemed at the moment as if every other man went down.
Wonder of wonders, as the smoke lifted a little, I saw to the right the tall form of our colonel
still on his gray horse, pointing with his sword to the second rebel line, and shouting, 'Forward,
my men! forward!'

"As the order left his lips, his sword fell, point-downward, and, with a headlong curve, he
went over his horse upon the rocks below. Even in his death he went towards the enemy. His
horse galloped in the same direction, but soon fell. I thought that Strahan was gone also,
for he was hidden by smoke. A second later I heard his voice: 'Forward! Charge!'

"The men seemed infuriated by the loss of the colonel, and by no means daunted. Our next mad
rush broke the second line of the enemy.

"The scene now defies all my powers of description. The little handful of men that was left
of my company were almost beyond control. Each soldier was acting under the savage impulse
to follow and kill some rebel before him. I shared the feeling, yet remained sane enough to
thank God when I saw Strahan leap lightly down from his staggering horse, yet ever crying,
'Forward!' A second later the poor animal fell dead.

"Our own cannons were bellowing above us; the shells of the enemy were shrieking over our heads.
There was a continuous crash of musketry that sounded like a fierce, devouring flame passing
through dry thorns, yet above all this babel of horrid sounds could be heard the shouts and
yells of the combatants and the shrieks and groans of wounded and dying men. Then remember
that I saw but a little section, a few yards in width, of a battle extending for miles.

"In our mad excitement we did not consider the odds against us. The two remaining lines of
battle were advancing swiftly through the fugitives, and we struck the first with such headlong
impetuosity that it was repulsed and gave back; but the fourth and last line passing through,
and being reinforced by the other broken lines, came unfaltering, and swept us back from sheer
weight of numbers. We were now reduced to a mere skirmish line. It was at this moment that
I saw Strahan fall, and it seemed but a second later that the enemy's advance passed over the
spot. It was impossible then to rescue him, for the lieutenant-colonel had given orders for
all to fall back and rally behind the guns that it was our duty to protect.  Indeed, the difficult
thing, now, was to get back. The Union regiment, on our right, had given way, after a gallant
fight, earlier than we had, and the rebels were on our flank and rear. A number of our men
going to the ridge, from which they had charged, ran into the enemy and were captured. There
were desperate hand-to-hand encounters, hair-breadth escapes, and strange episodes.

"One occurs to me which I saw with my own eyes. It happened a little earlier in the fight.
We were so close to the enemy that a man in my company had not time to withdraw his ramrod,
and, in his instinctive haste to shoot first at a rebel just before him, sent ramrod and all
through the Confederate's body, pinning him to the ground. The poor fellow stretched out his
hands and cried for mercy. My man not only wished to recover his rod, but was, I believe, actuated
by a kindly impulse, for he ran to the 'Johnny," pulled out the rod, jerked the man to his
feet, and started him on a run to our rear as prisoner.

"When at last what was left of the regiment reached its original position it numbered no more
than a full company. Scarcely a hundred were in line. Over one hundred of our men and the majority
of the officers were either killed or wounded. While the lieutenant-colonel was rallying us
near the battery, a shell struck a gun-carriage, hurling it against him, and he was home senseless
from the field. The command now devolved on the senior captain left unwounded.

"One of my men now said to me, 'Captain, why don't you go to the rear? Your face is so covered
with blood that you must be badly hurt.'

"It was only at that moment that I became conscious of my wound. In my intense anxiety about
Strahan, in the effort to get my men back in something like order, and in the shock of seeing
the lieutenant-colonel struck down, my mind seemed almost unaware of the existence of the body.
In the retreat I had felt something sting my hand like a nettle, and now found one of the fingers
of my left hand badly shattered. With this hand I had been wiping my brow, for it was intensely
hot. I therefore was the most sanguineous-looking man of our number.

"Of course I did not go to the rear because of a wound of so slight a nature, and my earnest
hope was that reinforcements would enable us to drive the enemy back so that I could go to
the spot where I had seen Strahan fall.

"What I have vainly attempted to describe occurred in less time than I have taken in telling
about it. I think it would have been much better if we had never left the line which we now
occupied, and which we still held in spite of the overwhelming superiority, in numbers, of
the enemy. If, instead of wasting the morning hours, we had fortified this line, we never could
have been driven from it.

"Our immediate foes, in front of us did not at that time advance much farther than the point
of our repulse, and, like ourselves, sought cover from which to fire. We now had a chance to
recover a little from our wild excitement, and to realize, in a slight degree, what was taking
place around us. Information came that our corps-commander had been seriously wounded. Our
own colonel lay, with other dead officers, a little in our rear, yet in plain sight.  We could
only give them a mournful glance, for the battle was still at its height, and was raging in
our front and for miles to the right. The thunder of three hundred or more guns made the very
earth tremble, while the shrieking and bursting of the shells above us filled the air with
a din that was infernal.

"But we had little chance to observe or think of anything except the enemy just below us. With
wolfish eyes they were watching every chance to pick off our men. Many of our killed and wounded
on the bloody declivity were in plain view, and one poor fellow, desperately hurt, would often
raise his hand and wave it to us.

"Our men acted like heroes, and took deliberate aim before they fired. When a poor fellow dropped,
one of our officers picked up the rifle and fired in his place."

"Did you do that?" Marian asked.

"Yes; my sword was of no service, and my handful of men needed no orders. Anything at such
a time is better than inaction, and we all felt that the line must be held. Every bullet counted,
you know.

"Some of our boys did very brave things at this time. For instance: rifles, that had become
so clogged or hot as to be unserviceable, were dropped, and the men would say to their immediate
companions, 'Be careful how you fire,' and then rush down the slope, pick up the guns of dead
or wounded comrades, and with these continue the fight.

"At last the enemy's fire slackened a little, and I went to take my farewell look at our colonel
and others of our officers whose bodies had been recovered. These were then carried to the
rear, and I never saw their familiar faces again.

"The horses now came up at a gallop to take away the battery near us, and I saw a thing which
touched me deeply. As the horses were turning that a gun might be limbered up, a shot, with
a clean cut, carried away a leg from one of the poor animals. The faithful, well-trained beast,
tried to hobble around into his place on three legs. He seemed to have caught the spirit which
animated the entire army that day.

"As I turned toward the regiment, the cry went up, 'They are flanking us!'

"The brief slackening of the enemy's fire had only indicated preparations for a general forward
movement. An aid now galloped to us with orders to fall back instantly. A few of my men had
been placed, for the sake of cover, in the woods on the right, and I hastened over to them
to give the order. By the time I had collected them, the enemy had occupied our old position
and we barely escaped capture. When we caught up with the regiment, our brigade-commander had
halted it and was addressing it in strong words of eulogy; adding, however, that he still expected
almost impossible things of his troops.

"It was pleasant to know that our efforts had been recognized and appreciated, but our hearts
were heavy with the thoughts of those we had lost. We were now sent to a piece of woods about
a mile to the rear, as a part of the reserve, and it so happened that we were not again called
into the fight, which ended, you know, the next day.

"I had bound up my fingers as well as I could, and now, in reaction and from loss of blood,
felt sick and faint. I did not wish to go to our field hospital, for I knew the scenes there
were so horrible that I should not be equal to witnessing them. Our surgeon came and dressed
my finger for me, and said that it would have to come off in the morning, and I now found that
my shoulder also had been slightly cut with a bullet. These injuries on that day, however,
were the merest trifles.

"Our supper was the dreariest meal I ever took. The men spoke in subdued tones, and every now
and then a rough fellow would draw his sleeve across his eyes, as so many things brought to
mind those who had breakfasted with us. We were like a household that had returned from burying
the greater part of its number. Yes, worse than this, for many, suffering from terrible wounds,
were in the hands of the enemy.

"Of course I grieved for the loss of men and officers, but I had come to feel like a brother
towards Strahan, and, fatigued as I was, solicitude on his account kept me awake for hours.
The battle was still raging on our extreme right, and I fell asleep before the ominous sounds
ceased.

"Waking with the dawn, I felt so much better and stronger that I took a hasty cup of coffee,
and then started toward the spot where I had seen Strahan fall, in the hope of reaching it.
The surgeon had ordered that I should be relieved from duty, and told me to keep quiet. This
was impossible with my friend's fate in such uncertainty. I soon found that the enemy occupied
the ground on which we had fought, and that to go beyond a certain point would be death or
captivity. Therefore I returned, the surgeon amputated my finger, and then I rested with the
regiment several hours. With the dawn, heavy fighting began again on the extreme right, but
we knew at the time little of its character or object.

"After an early dinner I became restless and went to our corps-hospitals to look after such
of the wounded of my company as had been carried thither. It was situated in a grove not far
away. I will not describe the scenes witnessed there, for it would only give you useless pain.
The surgeons had been at work all the night and morning around the amputation tables, and our
doctor and chaplain had done about all that could be accomplished for our poor fellows.  There
were hundreds of men lying on the ground, many of whom were in the agonies of death even as
I passed.

"I again went back to see if there had been any change in our front which would enable me to
reach Strahan. This still being impossible, I continued along our lines to the right at a slow
pace, that I might gain some idea of our position and prospects. My hope now of reaching Strahan
lay in our defeating Lee and gaining the field. Therefore I had a double motive to be intensely
interested in all I saw. Since nine in the morning a strange silence had settled on the field,
but after yesterday's experience it raised no delusive hopes.  With the aid of a small field-glass
that I carried, I could see the enemy's batteries, and catch glimpses of their half-concealed
infantry, which were moving about in a way that indicated active preparation for something.
Our officers had also made the most of this respite, and there had been a continuous shifting
of troops, strengthening of lines, and placing of artillery in position since the dawn. Now,
however, the quiet was wonderful, in view of the vast bodies of men which were hi deadly array.
Even the spiteful picket-firing had ceased.

"I had barely reached a high point, a little in the rear of the Second Corps, commanded by
General Hancock, when I saw evidences of excitement and interest around me. Eyes and field-glasses
were directed towards the enemy's lines nearly opposite. Springing on a rock near me, I turned
my glass in the same direction, and saw that Lee was massing his artillery along the edge of
the woods on the ridge opposite. The post of observation was a good one, and I determined to
maintain it. The rock promised shelter when the iron tempest should begin.

"Battery after battery came into position, until, with my glass, I could count nearly a hundred
guns. On our side batteries were massing also, both to the right and the left of where I stood.
Experience had so taught me what these preparations meant that I fairly trembled with excitement
and awe. It appeared as if I were about to witness one of the most terrific combats of the
world, and while I might well doubt whether anything could survive the concentrated fire of
these rebel guns, I could not resist the desire to see out what I felt must be the final and
supreme effort of both armies. Therefore I stuck to my rock and swept with my glass the salient
points of interest. I dreaded the effect of the awful cannonade upon our lines of infantry
that lay upon the ground below me, behind such slight shelter as they could find. Our position
at this point was commanding, but many of the troops were fearfully exposed, while our artillerymen
had to stand in plain view. Over all this scene, so awfully significant and unnaturally quiet,
the scorching July sun sent down its rays like fiery darts, which everywhere on the field scintillated
as if they were kindling innumerable fires.

"At last the enemy fired a single gun. Almost instantly a flashing line of light swept along
the massed Confederate batteries, I sprung down behind my rock as a perfect storm of iron swept
over and around me, and my heart stood almost still at the deep reverberations which followed.
This was but the prelude to the infernal symphony that followed. With remarkable rapidity and
precision of aim the enemy continued firing, not irregularly, but in immense thundering volleys,
all together. There would be a moment's pause, and then would come such a storm of iron that
it seemed to me that even my sheltering rock would be cut away, and that everything exposed
must be annihilated.

"At first I was exceedingly troubled that our guns did not reply. Could it be possible that
the enemy's fire was so destructive that our forces were paralyzed? I was learning to distinguish
between the measured cadences of the enemy's firing. After a hurtling shower flew over, I sprung
out, took a survey, and was so filled with exultation and confidence, that I crept back again
with hope renewed. Our men were standing at the guns, which officers were sighting in order
to get more accurate range, and the infantry had not budged. Of course there were streams of
wounded going to the rear, but this is true of every battle.

"I now had to share my slight cover with several others, and saw that if I went out again I
should lose it altogether. So I determined to wait out the artillery duel quietly. I could
see the effects of the enemy's shells in the rear, if not in front, and these were disastrous
enough. In the depression behind the ridge on which were our guns and infantry, there were
ammunition-wagons, ambulances, and caissons. Among these, shells were making havoc.  Soon a
caisson exploded with a terrific report and a great cloud of smoke, which, clearing, revealed
many prostrate forms, a few of which were able to crawl away.

"Minutes, which seemed like ages, had passed, and the horrible din was then doubled by the
opening of all our batteries. The ground beneath me trembled, but as time passed and our guns
kept up their steady fire, and the infantry evidently remained unshaken in their lines of defence,
my confidence became stronger. By degrees you grow accustomed to almost anything, and I now
found leisure to observe my companions behind the rock. I instantly perceived that two of them
were press-correspondents, young, boyish-looking fellows, who certainly proved themselves veterans
in coolness and courage. Even in that deadly tempest they were alert and busy with their note-books.

"When the caisson exploded, each swiftly wrote a few cabalistic symbols. There was a house
to the left, as we sat feeing our rear, and I saw that they kept their eyes on that almost
continually. Curious to know why, I shouted in the ear of one, asking the reason.  He wrote,
'Meade's headquarters,' and then I shared their solicitude. That it was occupied by some general
of high rank, was evident from the number of horses tied around it, and the rapid coming and
going of aids and orderlies; but it seemed a terrible thing that our commander-in-chief should
be so exposed. Shells flew about the little cottage like angry hornets about their nest, and
every few minutes one went in. The poor horses, tied and helpless, were kicking and plunging
in their terror, and one after another went down, killed or wounded. I was told that General
Meade and staff were soon compelled to leave the place.

"The hours of the cannonade grew monotonous and oppressive. Again and again caissons were exploded
and added to the terrible list of casualties. Wagons and ambulances--such of them as were not
wrecked--were driven out of range. Every moment or two the ground shook with the recoil and
thunder of our batteries, while the air above and around us seemed literally filled with shrieking,
moaning, whistling projectiles of almost every size and pattern in present use. From them came
puffs of smoke, sharp cracks, heard above the general din, as they exploded and showered around
us pieces of jagged iron. When a shell bursts, its fragments strike the ground obliquely, with
a forward movement; therefore our comparative safety behind our rock, which often shook from
the terrific impact of missiles on its outer side. So many had now sought its shelter that
some extended beyond its protection, and before the cannonade was over two were killed outright,
almost within reach of my arm. Many of the wounded, in going to the rear, were struck down
before reaching a place of safety. The same was true of the men bringing ammunition from the
caissons in the depression beneath us. Every few minutes an officer of some rank would be carried
by on a stretcher, with a man or two in attendance. I saw one of these hastily moving groups
prostrated by a shell, and none of them rose again or struggled. I only tell you of these scenes
in compliance with your wish, Miss Marian, and because I see that you have the spirit of a
soldier. I was told that, in the thickest of the fight, the wife of a general came on the field
in search of her husband, who was reported wounded. I believe that you could have done the same."

"I don't know," she replied, sadly,--"I don't know, for I never realized what war was before;"
and she looked apprehensively at Merwyn, fearing to see traces of weakness. His side face,
as he sat in the shadow, was pale indeed, but he was rigid and motionless. She received the
impression that he was bracing himself by the whole strength of his will to listen through
the dreadful story.

Again Mr. Vosburgh suggested that these details were too terrific for his daughter's nerves,
but she interrupted him almost sternly, saying: "No, papa, I intend to know just what my friends
have passed through. I feel that it is due to them, and, if I cannot hear quietly, I am not
worthy to be their friend. I can listen to words when Southern girls can listen to bullets.
Captain Blauvelt, you are describing the battle exactly as I asked and wished. My only fear
is that you are going beyond your strength;" and she poured him out a glass of light wine.

"When you come to hear all I passed through after leaving that rock, you will know that this
story-telling is not worth thinking about," said Blauvelt, with a slight laugh, "All my exposure
was well worth the risk, for the chance of telling it to a woman of your nerve. My hope now
is that Strahan may some day learn how stanch was our 'home support,' as we were accustomed
to call you. I assure you that many a man has been inspired to do his best because of such
friendship and sympathy. I am now about to tell you of the grandest thing I ever saw or expect
to see, and shall not abate one jot of praise because the heroic act was performed by the enemy."

CHAPTER XXXV.

THE GRAND ASSAULT.

"After seeming ages had passed," Blauvelt resumed, having taken a few moments of rest, "the
fire of our artillery slackened and soon ceased, and that of the rebete also became less rapid
and furious. We saw horses brought up, and some of our batteries going to the rear at a gallop.
Could our guns have been silenced? and was disaster threatening us? Our anxiety was so great
that the two correspondents and I rushed out and were speedily reassured. There was our infantry,
still in line, and we soon saw that reserve batteries were taking the place of those withdrawn.
We afterward learned that General Meade and brave General Hunt, Chief of Artillery, had ordered
our guns to be quiet and prepare for the assault which they knew would follow the cannonade.

"The wind blew from us towards the enemy, and our unbroken lines were in view. All honor to
the steadfast men who had kept their places through the most awful artillery combat ever known
on this continent. For nearly two mortal hours the infantry had been obliged to lie still and
see men on every side of them torn and mangled to death; but like a wide blue ribbon, as far
as the eye could reach, there they lay with the sunlight glittering on their polished muskets.
The rebels' fire soon slackened also. We now mounted the friendly rock, and I was busy with
my glass again. As the smoke lifted, which had covered the enemy's position, I saw that we
had not been the only sufferers. Many of their guns were overturned, and the ground all along
their line was thick with prostrate men.

"But they and their guns were forgotten. Their part in the bloody drama was to be superseded,
and we now witnessed a sight which can scarcely ever be surpassed. Emerging from the woods
on the opposite ridge, over a mile away, came long lines of infantry. Our position was to be
assaulted. I suppose the cessation of our firing led the enemy to think that our batteries
had been silenced and the infantry supports driven from the hill. The attacking column was
forming right under our eyes, and we could see other Confederate troops moving up on the right
and left to cover the movement and aid in carrying it out.

"There was bustle on our side also, in spite of the enemy's shells, which still fell thickly
along our line. New batteries were thundering up at a gallop; those at the front, which had
horses left, were withdrawn; others remained where they had been shattered and disabled, fresh
pieces taking position beside them. The dead and wounded were rapidly carried to the rear,
and the army stripped itself, like an athlete, for the final struggle.

"Our batteries again opened with solid shot at the distant Confederate infantry, but there
was only the hesitation on their part incident to final preparation. Soon on came their centre
rapidly, their flank supports, to right and left, moving after them.  It proved to be the launching
of a human thunderbolt, and I watched its progress, fascinated and overwhelmed with awe."

"Were you exposed at this time to the enemy's shells?" Marias asked.

"Yes, but their fire was not so severe as it had been, and my interest in the assault was so
absorbing that I could scarcely think of anything else. I could not help believing that the
fate of our army, perhaps of the country, was to be decided there right under my eyes, and
this by an attack involving such deadly peril to the participants that I felt comparatively safe.

"The scene during the next half-hour defies description. All ever witnessed in Roman amphitheatres
was child's play in comparison. The artillery on both sides had resumed its heavy din, the
enemy seeking to distract our attention and render the success of their assault more probable,
and we concentrating our fire on that solid attacking column. As they approached nearer, our
guns were shotted with shells that made great gaps in their ranks, but they never faltered.
Spaces were closed instantly, and on they still came like a dark, resistless wave tipped with
light, as the sun glinted on their bayonets through rifts of smoke.

"As they came nearer, our guns in front crumbled and decimated the leading ranks with grape
and canister, while other batteries farther away to the right and left still plowed red furrows
with shot and shell; but the human torrent, although shrinking and diminishing, flowed on.
I could not imagine a more sublime exhibition of courage.  Should the South rear to the skies
a monument to their soldiers, it would be insignificant compared with that assaulting column,
projected across the plain of Gettysburg.

"At the foot of the ridge the leaders of this forlorn hope, as it proved, halted their troops
for a moment. As far as the smoke permitted me to see, it seemed that the supporting Confederate
divisions had not kept pace with the centre. Would the assault be made? The familiar rebel
yell was a speedy answer, as they started up the acclivity, firing as they came. Now, more
vivid than the sunlight, a sheet of fire flashed out along our line, and the crash of musketry
drowned even the thunder of the cannon.

"The mad impulse of battle was upon me, as upon every one, and I rushed down nearer our lines
to get a better view, also from the instinctive feeling that that attack must be repulsed,
for it aimed at nothing less than the piercing of the centre of our army. The front melted
away as if composed of phantoms, but other spectral men took their place, the flashes of their
muskets outlining their position. On, on they came, up to our front line and over it. At the
awful point of impact there was on our side a tall, handsome brigadier, whose black eyes glowed
like coals. How he escaped so long was one of the mysteries of battle. His voice rang out above
the horrid din as he rallied his men, who were not retreating, but were simply pushed back
by the still unspent impetus of the rebel charge. I could not resist his appeal, or the example
of his heroism, and, seizing a musket and some cartridges belonging to a fallen soldier, I
was soon in the thick of it. I scarcely know what happened for the next few moments, so terrible
were the excitement and confusion. Union troops and officers were rushing in on all sides,
without much regard to organization, under the same impulse which had actuated me. I found
myself firing point-blank at the enemy but a few feet away. I saw a rebel officer waving his
hat upon his sword, and fired at him. Thank Heaven I did not hit him! for, although he seemed
the leading spirit in the charge, I would not like to think I had killed so brave a man. In
spite of all our efforts, they pushed us back, back past the battery we were trying to defend.
I saw a young officer, not far away, although wounded, run his gun a little forward with the
aid of the two or three men left on their feet, fire one more shot, and fall dead. Then I was
parrying bayonet thrusts and seeking to give them. One fierce-looking fellow was making a lunge
at me, but in the very act fell over, pierced by a bullet. A second later the rebel officer,
now seen to be a general, had his hand on a gun and was shouting, 'Victory!' but the word died
on his lips as he fell, for at this moment there was a rush in our rear. A heavy body of men
burst, like a tornado, through our shattered lines, and met the enemy in a hand-to-hand conflict.

"I had been nearly run over in this charge, and now regained my senses somewhat. I saw that
the enemy's advance was checked, that the spot where lay the Confederate general would mark
the highest point attained by the crimson wave of Southern valor, for Union troops were concentrating
in overwhelming numbers. The wound in my hand had broken out afresh. I hastened to get back
out of the melee, the crush, and the 'sing' of bullets, and soon reached my old post of observation,
exhausted and panting. The correspondents were still there, and one of them patted me on the
shoulder in a way meant to be encouraging, and offered to put my name in his paper, an honor
which I declined. We soon parted, unknown to each other. I learned, however, that the name
of the gallant brigadier was Webb, and that he had been wounded. So also was General Hancock
at this point.

"The enemy's repulse was now changed into a rout. Prisoners were brought in by hundreds, while
those retreating across the plain were followed by death-dealing shot and shell from our lines.
As I sat resting on my rock of observation, I felt that one could not exult over such a foe,
and I was only conscious of profound gratitude over my own and the army's escape. Certainly
if enough men, animated by the same desperate courage, had taken part in the attack, it would
have been irresistible.

"As soon as I saw that the battle at this point was practically decided, I started back towards
our left with the purpose of finding my regiment and our surgeon, for my hand had become very
painful. I was so fortunate as to meet with my command as it was being moved up within a few
rods of the main line of the Third Corps, where we formed a part of the reserve. Joining my
little company and seeing their familiar faces was like coming home. Their welcome, a cup of
coffee, and the redressing of my wound made me over again. I had to answer many questions from
the small group of officers remaining, for they, kept in the rear all day, had not yet learned
much about the battle or its results.

"While I gladdened their hearts with the tidings of our victory, our surgeon growled: 'I'll
have you put under arrest if you don't keep quiet. You've been doing more than look on, or
your hand would not be in its present condition.'

"Soon after I fell asleep, with my few and faithful men around me, and it was nearly midnight
when I wakened."

"It's very evident that none of your present audience is inclined to sleep," Marian exclaimed,
with a deep breath.

"And yet it's after midnight," Mr. Vosburgh added. "I fear we are taxing you, captain, far
beyond your strength. Your cheeks, Marian, are feverish."

"I do not feel weary yet," said the young officer, "if you are not.  Imagine that I have just
waked up from that long nap of which I have spoken. Miss Marian was such a sympathetic listener
that I dwelt much longer than I intended on scenes which impressed me powerfully.  I have not
yet described my search for Strahan, or given Mr. Merwyn such hints as my experience affords.
Having just come from the field, I do not see that he could gain much by undue haste. He can
accomplish quite as much by leaving sometime tomorrow. To be frank, I believe that the only
place to find Strahan is under a rebel guard going South. Our troops may interpose in time
to release him; if not, he will be exchanged before long."

"In a matter of this kind there should be no uncertainty which can possibly be removed," Merwyn
said, in a husky voice. "I shall now save time by obtaining the information you can give, for
I shall know better how to direct my search. I shall certainly go in the morning."

"Yes, captain," said Marian, eagerly. "Since you disclaim weariness we could listen for hours
yet. You are a skilful narrator, for, intensely as your story has interested me, you have reserved
its climax to the last, even though your search led you only among woful scenes in the hospitals."

"On such scenes I will touch as lightly as possible, and chiefly for Mr. Merwyn's benefit;
for if Strahan had been left on the field, either killed or wounded, I do not see how he could
have escaped me." Then, with a smile at the young girl, he added: "Since you credit me with
some skill as a story-teller, and since my story is so long, perhaps it should be divided.
In that case what I am now about to relate should be headed with the words, 'My search for
Strahan.'"

CHAPTER XXXVI.

BLAUVELT'S SEARCH FOR STRAHAN.

"You will remember," said the captain, after a moment's pause, that he might take up the thread
of his narrative consecutively, "that I awoke a little before midnight. At first I was confused,
but soon all that had happened came back to me. I found myself a part of a long line of sleeping
men that formed the reserve. Not farther than from here across the street was another line
in front of us. Beyond this were our vigilant pickets, and then the vedettes of the enemy.
All seemed strangely still and peaceful, but a single shot would have brought thousands of
men to their feet. The moon poured a soft radiance over all, and gave to the scene a weird
and terrible beauty. The army was like a sleeping giant. Would its awakening be as terrible
as on the last three mornings? Then I thought of that other army sleeping beyond our lines,--an
army which neither bugle nor the thunder of all our guns could awaken.

"I soon distinguished faint, far-off sounds from the disputed territory beyond our pickets.
Rising, I put my hand to my ear, and then heard the words, 'Water! water!'

"They were the cries of wounded men entreating for that which would quench their intolerable
thirst. The thought that Strahan might be among this number stung me to the very quick, and
I hastened to the senior captain, who now commanded the regiment. I found him alert and watchful,
with the bugle at his side, for he felt the weight of responsibility so suddenly thrust upon him.

"'Captain Markham,' I said, 'do you hear those cries for water?'

"'Yes,' he replied, sadly; 'I have heard them for hours,

"'Among them may be Strahan's voice,' I said, eagerly.

"'Granting it, what could we do? Our pickets are way this side of the spot where he fell.'

"'Captain,' I cried, 'Strahan was like a brother to me. I can't rest here with the possibility
that he is dying yonder for a little water. I am relieved from duty, you know. If one of my
company will volunteer to go with me, will you give him your permission? I know where Strahan
fell, and am willing to try to reach him and bring him in.'

"'No,' said the captain, 'I can't give such permission. You might be fired on and the whole
line aroused. You can go to our old brigade-commander, however--he now commands the division,--and
see what he says. He's back there under that tree. Of course, you know, I sympathize with your
feeling, but I cannot advise the risk. Good heavens, Blauvelt! we've lost enough officers already.'

"'I'll be back soon,' I answered.

"To a wakeful aid I told my errand, and he aroused the general, who was silent after he had
been made acquainted with my project.

"'I might bring in some useful information,' I added, hastily.

"The officer knew and liked Strahan, but said: 'I shall have to put my permission on the ground
of a reconnoissance. I should be glad to know if any changes are taking place on our front,
and so would my superiors. Of course you understand the risk you run when once beyond our pickets?'

"'Strahan would do as much and more for me,' I replied.

"'Very well;' and he gave me permission to take a volunteer, at the same time ordering me to
report to him on my return.

"I went back to our regimental commander, who growled, 'Well, if you will go I suppose you
will; but it would be a foolhardy thing for even an unwounded man to attempt.'

"I knew a strong, active young fellow in my company who would go anywhere with me, and, waking
him up, explained my purpose. He was instantly on the qui vive. I procured him a revolver,
and we started at once. On reaching our pickets we showed our authority to pass, and were informed
that the enemy's vedettes ran along the ridge on which we had fought the day before. Telling
our pickets to pass the word not to fire on us if we came in on the run, we stole down into
the intervening valley.

"The moon was now momentarily obscured by clouds, and this favored us. My plan was to reach
the woods on which the right of our regiment had rested. Here the shadows would be deep, and
our chances better. Crouching and creeping silently from bush to bush, we made our gradual
progress until we saw a sentinel slowly pacing back and forth along the edge of the woods.
Most of his beat was in shadow, and there were bushes and rocks extending almost to it. We
watched him attentively for a time, and then my companion whispered: 'The Johnny seems half
dead with sleep. I believe I can steal up and capture him without a sound. I don't see how
we can get by him as long as he is sufficiently wide awake to walk.'

"'Very well. You have two hands, and my left is almost useless,' I said. 'Make your attempt
where the shadow is deepest, and if he sees you, and is about to shoot, see that you shoot
first. I'll be with you instantly if you succeed, and cover your retreat in case of failure."

"In a moment, revolver in hand, he was gliding, like a shadow, from cover to cover, and it
was his good fortune to steal up behind the sleepy sentinel, grasp his musket, and whisper,
with his pistol against his head, 'Not a sound, or you are dead.'

"The man was discreet enough to be utterly silent. In a moment I was by Rush's side--that was
the name of the brave fellow who accompanied me--and found that he had disarmed his prisoner.
I told Rush to take the rebel's musket and walk up and down the beat, and especially to show
himself in the moonlight. I made the Johnny give me his word not to escape, telling him that
he would be shot instantly if he did. I gave him the impression that others were watching him.
I then tied his hands behind him and fastened him to a tree in the shade. Feeling that I had
not a moment to lose, I passed rapidly down through the woods bearing to the left. The place
was only too familiar, and even in the moonlight I could recognize the still forms of some
of my own company. I found two or three of our regiment still alive, and hushed them as I pressed
water to their lips. I then asked if they knew anything about Strahan. They did not. Hastening
on I reached the spot, by a large boulder, where I had seen Strahan fall. He was not there,
or anywhere near it. I even turned up the faces of corpses in my wish to assure myself; for
our dead officers had been partially stripped. I called his name softly, then more distinctly,
and at last, forgetful in my distress, loudly.  Then I heard hasty steps, and crouched down
behind a bush, with my hand upon my revolver. But I had been seen.

"A man approached rapidly, and asked, in a gruff voice, 'What the devil are you doing here?'

"'Looking for a brother who fell hereabouts,' I replied, humbly.

"'You are a--Yankee,' was the harsh reply, 'and a prisoner; I know your Northern tongue."

"I fired instantly, and wounded him, but not severely, for he fired in return, and the bullet
whizzed by my ear. My next shot brought him down, and then I started on a dead run for the
woods, regained Rush, and, with our prisoner, we stole swiftly towards our lines. We were out
of sure range before the startled pickets of the enemy realized what was the matter. A few
harmless shots were sent after us, and then we gained our lines. I am satisfied that the man
I shot was a rebel officer visiting the picket line. Our firing inside their lines could not
be explained until the gap caused by the missing sentinel we had carried off was discovered.

"Then they knew that 'Yanks,' as they called us, had been within their lines. Rush, taking
the sentinel's place while I was below the hill, had prevented an untimely discovery of our
expedition. Perhaps it was well that I met the rebel officer, for he was making directly towards
the spot where I had left my companion.

"The poor fellow we had captured was so used up that he could scarcely keep pace with us. He
said he had not had any rest worth speaking of for forty-eight hours. I passed through our
lines, now alert, and reported at Division Headquarters. The general laughed, congratulated
us, and said he was glad we had not found Strahan among the dead or seriously wounded, for
now there was a good chance of seeing him again.

"I turned over our prisoner to him, and soon all was quiet again. Captain Markham, of our regiment,
greeted us warmly, but I was so exhausted that I contented him with a brief outline of what
had occurred, and said I would tell him the rest in the morning. Satisfied now that Strahan
was not crying for water, I was soon asleep again by the side of Rush, and did not waken till
the sun was well above the horizon.

"I soon learned that the vedettes of the enemy had disappeared from before our lines, and that
our skirmishers were advancing. After a hasty breakfast I followed them, and soon reached again
the ground I had visited in the night. On the way I met two of our men to whom I had given
water. The other man had meanwhile died. The survivors told me positively that they had not
seen or heard of Strahan after he had fallen. They also said that they had received a little
food and water from the rebels, or they could not have survived.

"The dead were still unburied, although parties were sent out within our picket line during
the day to perform this sad duty, and I searched the ground thoroughly for a wide distance,
acting on the possibility that Strahan might have crawled away somewhere.

"I shall not describe the appearance of the field, or speak of my feelings as I saw the bodies
of the brave men and officers of our regiment who had so long been my companions.

"The rest of my story is soon told. From our surgeon I had positive assurance that Strahan
had not been brought to our corps hospital. Therefore, I felt driven to one of two conclusions:
either he was in a Confederate hospital on the field beyond our lines, or else he was a prisoner.

"As usual, the heavy concussion of the artillery produced a rain-storm, which set in on the
afternoon of the 4th, and continued all night. As the enemy appeared to be intrenching in a
strong position, there seemed no hope of doing any more that day, and I spent the night in
a piece of woods with my men.

"On the dark, dreary morning of the 5th, it was soon discovered that the Confederate army had
disappeared. As the early shades of the previous stormy evening had settled over the region,
its movement towards Virginia had begun. I became satisfied before night that Strahan also
was southward bound, for, procuring a horse, I rode all day, visiting the temporary Confederate
hospitals. Since they had left their own severely wounded men, they certainly would not have
taken Union soldiers unable to walk. Not content with my first search, I spent the next two
days in like manner, visiting the houses in Gettysburg and vicinity, until satisfied that my
effort was useless. Then, availing myself of a brief leave of absence, I came north."

Blauvelt then gave Merwyn some suggestions, adding: "If you find no trace of him on the field,
I would advise, as your only chance, that you follow the track of Lee's army, especially the
roads on which their prisoners were taken. Strahan might have given out by the way, and have
been left at some farmhouse or in a village. It would be hopeless to go beyond the Potomac."

Rising, he concluded: "Mark my words, and see if I am not right. Strahan is a prisoner, and
will be exchanged." Then with a laugh and a military salute to Marian, he said, "I have finished
my report."

"It is accepted with strong commendation and congratulations," she replied. "I shall recommend
you for promotion."

"Good-by, Miss Vosburgh," said Merwyn, gravely. "I shall start in the morning, and I agree
with Captain Blauvelt that my best chance lies along the line of Lee's retreat."

Again she gave him her hand kindly in farewell; but her thought was: "How deathly pale he is!
This has been a night of horrors to him,--to me also; yet if I were a man I know I could meet
what other men face."

"She was kind," Merwyn said to himself, as he walked through the deserted streets; "but I fear
it was only the kindness of pitiful toleration. It is plainer than ever that she adores heroic
action, that her ardor in behalf of the North is scarcely less than that of my mother for the
South, and yet she thinks I am not brave enough to face a musket What a figure I make beside
the men of whom we have heard to-night! Well, to get away, to be constantly employed, is my
only hope. I believe I should become insane if I brooded much longer at home."

In spite of his late hours, he ordered an early breakfast, proposing to start without further
delay.

The next morning, as he sat down to the table, the doorbell rang, there was a hasty step down
the hall, and Strahan, pale and gaunt, with his arm in a sling, burst in upon him, and exclaimed,
with his old sang froid and humor: "Just in time. Yes, thanks; I'll stay and take a cup of
coffee with you."

Merwyn greeted him with mingled wonder and gladness, yet even at that moment the thought occurred
to him: "Thwarted on every side! I can do absolutely nothing."

After Strahan was seated Merwyn said: "Half an hour later I should have been off to Gettysburg
in search of you. Blauvelt is here, and says he saw you fall, and since a blank, so far as
you are concerned."

"Thank God! He escaped then?"

"Yes; but is wounded slightly. What is the matter with your arm?"

"Only a bullet-hole through it. That's nothing for Gettysburg. I was captured, and escaped
on the first night's march. Dark and stormy, you know. But it's a long story, and I'm hungry
as a wolf. Where's Blauvelt?"

"He's a guest at Mr. Vosburgh's."

"Lucky fellow!" exclaimed Strahan; and for some reason the edge of his appetite was gone.

"Yes, he IS a lucky fellow, indeed; and so are you," said Merwyn, bitterly. "I was there last
evening till after midnight;" and he explained what had occurred, adding, "Blauvelt trumpeted
your praise, and on the night of the 3d he went inside the enemy's picket line in search of
you, at the risk of his life.'

"Heaven bless the fellow! Wait till I spin my yarn. I shall give him credit for the whole victory."

"Write a note to Miss Vosburgh, and I'll send it right down."

"Confound it, Merwyn! don't you see I'm winged? You will even have to cut my food for me as
if I were a baby."

"Very well, you dictate and I'll write. By the way, I have a note for you in my pocket."

Strahan seized upon it and forgot his breakfast. Tears suffused his blue eyes before he finished
it, and at last he said, "Well, if you HAD found me in some hospital this would have cured
me, or else made death easy."

Merwyn's heart grew heavy, in spite of the fact that he had told himself so often that there
was no hope for him, and he thought, "In the terrible uncertainty of Strahan's fate she found
that he was more to her than she had supposed, and probably revealed as much in her note, which
she feared might reach him only when death was sure."

The glad intelligence was despatched, and then Merwyn said: "After you have breakfasted I will
send you down in my coupe."

"You will go with me?"

"No. There is no reason why I should be present when Miss Vosburgh greets her friends. I remained
last night by request, that I might be better informed in prosecuting my search."

Strahan changed the subject, but thought: "She's loyal to her friends. Merwyn, with all his
money, has made no progress. Her choice will eventually fall on Lane, Blauvelt, or poor little
me.  Thank Heaven I gave the Johnnies the slip! The other fellows shall have a fair field,
but I want one, too."

Before they had finished their breakfast Blauvelt came tearing in, and there was a fire of
questions between the brother-officers.

Tears and laughter mingled with their words; but at last they became grave and quiet as they
realized how many brave comrades would march with them no more.

In a few moments Blauvelt said, "Come; Miss Marian said she would not take a mouthful of breakfast
till you returned with me."

Merwyn saw them drive away, and said, bitterly, "Thanks to my mother, I shall never have any
part in such greetings."

CHAPTER XXXVII.

STRAHAN'S ESCAPE.

AFTER Blauvelt had left Mr. Vosburgh's breakfast-table in obedience to his own and Marian's
wish to see Strahan at once, the young girl laughed outright--she would laugh easily to-day--and
exclaimed:--

"Poor Mr. Merwyn! He is indeed doomed to inglorious inaction. Before he could even start on
his search, Strahan found him. His part in this iron age will consist only in furnishing the
sinews of war and dispensing canned delicacies in the hospitals. I do feel sorry for him, for
last night he seemed to realize the fact himself. He looked like a ghost, back in the shadow
that he sought when Captain Blauvelt's story grew tragic. I believe he suffered more in hearing
about the shells than Mr. Blauvelt did in hearing and seeing them."

"It's a curious case," said her father, musingly. "He was and has been suffering deeply from
some cause. I have not fully accepted your theory yet."

"Since even your sagacity can construct no other, I am satisfied that I am right. But I have
done scoffing at Mr. Merwyn, and should feel as guilty in doing so as if I had shown contempt
for physical deformity. I have become so convinced that he suffers terribly from consciousness
of his weakness, that I now pity him from the depths of my heart. Just think of a young fellow
of his intelligence listening to such a story as we heard last night and of the inevitable
contrasts that he must have drawn!"

"Fancy also," said her father, smiling, "a forlorn lover seeing your cheeks aflame and your
eyes suffused with tears of sympathy for young heroes, one of whom was reciting his epic. Strahan
is soon to repeat his; then Lane will appear and surpass them all."

"Well," cried Marian, laughing, "you'll admit they form a trio to be proud of."

"Oh, yes, and will have to admit more, I suppose, before long. Girls never fall in love with
trios."

"Nonsense, papa, they are all just like brothers to me." Then there was a rush of tears to
her eyes, and she said, brokenly, "The war is not over yet, and perhaps not one of them will
survive."

"Come, my dear," her father reassured her, gently, "you must imitate your soldier friends,
and take each day as it comes. Remembering what they have already passed through, I predict
that they all survive. The bravest men are the most apt to escape."

Marian's greeting of Strahan was so full of feeling, and so many tears suffused her dark blue
eyes, that they inspired false hopes in his breast and unwarranted fears in that of Blauvelt.
The heroic action and tragic experience of the young and boyish Strahan had touched the tenderest
chords in her heart. Indeed, as she stood, holding his left hand in both her own, they might
easily have been taken for brother and sister. His eyes were almost as blue as hers, and his
brow, where it had not been exposed to the weather, as fair.  She knew of his victory over
himself. Almost at the same time with herself, he had cast behind him a weak, selfish, frivolous
life, assuming a manhood which she understood better than others. Therefore, she had for him
a tenderness, a gentleness of regard, which her other friends of sterner natures could not
inspire.  Indeed, so sisterly was her feeling that she could have put her arms about his neck
and welcomed him with kisses, without one quickening throb of the pulse. But he did not know
this then, and his heart bounded with baseless hopes.

Poor Blauvelt had never cherished many, and the old career with which he had tried to be content
defined itself anew. He would fight out the war, and then give himself up to his art.

He could be induced to stay only long enough to finish his breakfast, and then said: "Strahan
can tell me the rest of his story over the camp-fire before long. My mother has now the first
claim, and I must take a morning train in order to reach home to-night."

"I also must go," exclaimed Mr. Vosburgh, looking at his watch, "and shall have to hear your
story at second hand from Marian. Rest assured," he added, laughing, "it will lose nothing
as she tells it this evening."

"And I order you, Captain Blauvelt, to make this house your headquarters when you are in town,"
said Marian, giving his hand a warm pressure in parting. Strahan accompanied his friend to
the depot, then sought his family physician and had his wound dressed.

"I advise that you reach your country home soon," said the doctor; "your pulse is feverish."

The young officer laughed and thought he knew the reason better than his medical adviser, and
was soon at the side of her whom he believed to be the exciting cause of his febrile symptoms.

"Oh," he exclaimed, throwing himself on a lounge, "isn't this infinitely better than a stifling
Southern prison?" and he looked around the cool, shadowy drawing-room, and then at the smiling
face of his fair hostess, as if there were nothing left to be desired.

"You have honestly earned this respite and home visit," she said, taking a low chair beside
him, "and now I'm just as eager to hear your story as I was to listen to that of Captain Blauvelt,
last night."

"No more eager?" he asked, looking wistfully into her face.

"That would not be fair," she replied, gently. "How can I distinguish between my friends, when
each one surpasses even my ideal of manly action?"

"You will some day," he said, thoughtfully. "You cannot help doing so. It is the law of nature.
I know I can never be the equal of Lane and Blauvelt."

"Arthur," she said, gravely, taking his hand, "let me be frank with you. It will be best for
us both. I love you too dearly, I admire and respect you too greatly, to be untrue to your
best interests even for a moment. What's more, I am absolutely sure that you only wish what
is right and best for me. Look into my eyes. Do you not see that if your name was Arthur Vosburgh,
I could scarcely feel differently? I do love you more than either Mr. Lane or Mr.  Blauvelt.
They are my friends in the truest and strongest sense of the word, but--let me tell you the
truth--you have come to seem like a younger brother. We must be about the same age, but a woman
is always older in her feelings than a man, I think. I don't say this to claim any superiority,
but to explain why I feel as I do. Since I came to know--to understand you--indeed, I may say,
since we both changed from what we were, my thoughts have followed you in a way that they would
a brother but a year or two younger than myself,--that is, so far as I can judge, having had
no brother.  Don't you understand me?"

"Yes," he replied, laughing a little ruefully, "up to date."

"Very well," she added, with an answering laugh, "let it be then to date. I shall not tell
you that I feel like a sister without being as frank as one. I have never loved any one in
the way--Oh, well, you know. I don't believe these stern times are conducive to sentiment.
Come, tell me your story."

"But you'll give me an equal chance with the others," he pleaded.

She now laughed outright. "How do I know what I shall do?" she asked. "I may come to you some
day for sympathy and help. According to the novels, people are stricken down as if by one of
your hateful shells and all broken up. I don't know, but I'm inclined to believe that while
a girl can withhold her love from an unworthy object, she cannot deliberately give it here
or there as she chooses. Now am I not talking to you like a sister?"

"Yes, too much so--"

"Oh, come, I have favored you more highly than any one."

"Do not misunderstand me," he said, earnestly, "I'm more grateful than I can tell you, but--"

"But tell me your story. There is one thing I can give you at once,--the closest attention."

"Very well. I only wish you were like one of the enemy's batteries, so I could take you by
storm. I'd face all the guns that were at Gettysburg for the chance."

"Arthur, dear Arthur, I do know what you have faced from a simple sense of duty and patriotism.
Blauvelt was a loyal, generous friend, and he has told us."

"You are wrong. 'The girl I left behind me' was the corps-de-reserve from which I drew my strength.
I believe the same was true of Blauvelt, and a better, braver fellow never drew breath. He
would make a better officer than I, for he is cooler and has more brains."

"Now see here, Major Strahan," cried Marian, in mock dignity, "as your superior officer, I
am capable of judging of the merits of you both, and neither of you can change my estimate.
You are insubordinate, and I shall put you under arrest if you don't tell me how you escaped
at once. You have kept a woman's curiosity in check almost as long as your brave regiment held
the enemy, and that's your greatest achievement thus far. Proceed. Captain Blauvelt has enabled
me to keep an eye on you till you fell and the enemy charged over you. Now you know just where
to begin."

"My prosaic story is soon told. Swords and pike-staffs! what a little martinet you are! Well,
the enemy was almost on me. I could see their flushed, savage faces. Even in that moment I
thought of you and whispered, 'Good-by,' and a prayer to God for your happiness flashed through
my mind."

"Arthur, don't talk that way. I can't stand it;" and there was a rush of tears to her eyes.

"I'm beginning just where you told me to. The next second there was a sting in my right arm,
then something knocked me over and I lost consciousness for a few moments. I am satisfied,
also, that I was grazed by a bullet that tore my scabbard from my side. When I came to my senses,
I crawled behind a rock so as not to be shot by our own men, and threw away my sword. I didn't
want to surrender it, you know. Soon after a rebel jerked me to my feet.

"'Can you stand?' he asked.

"'I will try,' I answered.

"'Join that squad of prisoners, then, and travel right smart.'

"I staggered away, too dazed for many clear ideas, and with others was hurried about half a
mile away to a place filled with the rebel wounded. Here a Union soldier, who happened to have
some bandages with him, dressed my arm. The Confederate surgeons had more than they could do
to look after their own men. Just before dark all the prisoners who were able to walk were
led into a large field, and a strong guard was placed around us.

"Although my wound was painful, I obtained some sleep, and awoke the next morning with the
glad consciousness that life with its chances was still mine. We had little enough to eat that
day, and insufficient water to drink. This foretaste of the rebel commissariat was enough for
me, and I resolved to escape if it were a possible thing."

"You wanted to see me a little, too, didn't you? Nevertheless, you shall have a good lunch
before long."

"Such is my fate. First rebel iron and now irony. I began to play the role of feebleness and
exhaustion, and it did not require much effort. Of course we were all on the qui vive to see
what would happen next, and took an intense interest in the fight of the 3d, which Blauvelt
has described. The scene of the battle was hidden from us, but we gathered, from the expression
of our guards' faces and the confusion around us, that all had not gone to the enemy's mind,
and so were hopeful. In the evening we were marched to the outskirts of Gettysburg and kept
there till the afternoon of the 4th, when we started towards Virginia. I hung back and dragged
myself along, and so was fortunately placed near the rear of the column, and we plodded away.
I thanked Heaven that the night promised to be dark and stormy, and was as vigilant as an Indian,
looking for my chance. It seemed long in coming, for at first the guards were very watchful.
At one point I purposely stumbled and fell, hoping to crawl into the bushes, but a rebel was
right on me and helped me up with his bayonet."

"O Arthur!"

"Yes, the risks were great, for we had been told that the first man who attempted to leave
the line would be shot. I lagged behind as if I could not keep up, and so my vigilant guard
got ahead of me, and I proposed to try it on with the next fellow. I did not dare look around,
for my only chance was to give the impression that I fell from utter exhaustion. We were winding
around a mountain-side and I saw some dark bushes just beyond me. I staggered towards them
and fell just beside them, and lay as if I were dead.

"A minute passed, then another, and then there was no other sound than the tramp and splash
in the muddy road. I edged still farther and farther from this, my head down the steep bank,
and soon found myself completely hidden. The comrade next to me either would not tell if he
understood my ruse, or else was so weary that he had not noticed me. If the guard saw me, he
concluded that I was done for and not worth further bother.

"After the column had passed, I listened to hear if others were coming, then stumbled down
the mountain, knowing that my best chance was to strike some stream and follow the current.
It would take me into a valley where I would be apt to find houses. At last I became so weary
that I lay down in a dense thicket and slept till morning.  I awoke as hungry as a famished
wolf, and saw nothing but a dense forest on every side. But the brook murmured that it would
guide me, and I now made much better progress in the daylight. At last I reached a little clearing
and a wood-chopper's cottage. The man was away, but his wife received me kindly and said I
was welcome to such poor fare and shelter as they had. She gave me a glass of milk and some
fried bacon and corn-bread, and I then learned all about the nectar and ambrosia of the gods.
In the evening her husband came home and said that Lee had been whipped by the Yanks, and that
he was retreating rapidly, whereon I drank to the health of my host nearly all the milk given
that night by his lean little cow. He was a good-natured, loutish sort of fellow, and promised
to guide me in a day or two to the west of the line of retreat. He seemed very tearful of falling
in with the rebels, and I certainly had seen all I wished of them for the present, so I was
as patient as he desired.  At last he kept his word and guided me to a village about six miles
away. I learned that Confederate cavalry had been there within twenty-four hours, and, tired
as I was, I hired a conveyance and was driven to another village farther to the northwest,
for I now had a morbid horror of being recaptured. After a night's rest in a small hamlet,
I was taken in a light wagon to the nearest railway station, and came on directly, arriving
here about six this morning. Finding our house closed, I made a descent on Merwyn. I telegraphed
mother last evening that I should be home this afternoon."

"You should have telegraphed me, also," said Marian, reproachfully. "You would have saved me
some very sad hours. I did not sleep much last night."

"Forgive me. I thoughtlessly wished to give you a surprise, and I could scarcely believe you
cared so much."

"You will always believe it now, Arthur. Merciful Heaven! what risks you have had!"

"You have repaid me a thousand-fold. Friend, sister, or wife, you will always be to me my good
genius."

"I wish the war was over," she said, sadly. "I have not heard from Captain Lane for weeks,
and after the battle the first tidings from Blauvelt was that he was wounded and that you were
wounded and missing. I can't tell you how oppressed I was with fear and foreboding."

"How about Lane?" Strahan asked, with interest.

She told him briefly the story she had heard and of the silence which had followed.

"He leads us all," was his response. "If he survives the war, he will win you, Marian."

"You suggest a terrible 'if' and there may be many others. I admit that he has kindled my imagination
more than any man I ever saw, but you, Arthur, have touched my heart. I could not speak to
him, had he returned, as I am now speaking to you. I have the odd feeling that you and I are
too near of kin to be anything to each other except just what we are. You are so frank and
true to me, that I can't endure the thought of misleading you, even unintentionally."

"Very well, I'll grow up some day, and as long as you remain free, I'll not give up hope."

"Foolish boy! Grow up, indeed! Who mounted his horse in that storm of shells and bullets in
spite of friendly remonstrances, and said, 'The men must see us to-day'? What more could any
man do? I'm just as proud of you as if my own brother had spoken the words;" and she took his
hand caressingly, then exclaimed, "You are feverish."

A second later her hand was on his brow, and she sprung up and said, earnestly, "You should
have attention at once."

"I fancy the doctor was right after all," said Strahan, rising also.  "I'll take the one o'clock
train and be at home in a couple of hours."

"I wish you would stay. You can't imagine what a devoted nurse I'll be."

"Please don't tempt me. It wouldn't be best. Mamma is counting the minutes before my return
now, and it will please her if I come on an earlier train. Mountain air and rest will soon
bring me around, and I can run down often. I think the fever proceeds simply from my wound,
which hasn't had the best care. I don't feel seriously ill at all."

She ordered iced lemonade at once, lunch was hastened, and then she permitted him to depart,
with the promise that he would write a line that very night.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.

A LITTLE REBEL.

THE next day Marian received a note from Strahan saying that some bad symptoms had developed
in connection with his wound, but that his physician had assured him that if he would keep
absolutely quiet in body and mind for a week or two they would pass away, concluding with the
words: "I have promised mother to obey orders, and she has said that she would write you from
time to time about me. I do not think I shall be very ill."

"O dear!" exclaimed Marian to her father at dinner, "what times these are! You barely escape
one cause of deep anxiety before there is another. Now what is troubling you, that your brow
also is clouded?"

"Is it not enough that your troubles trouble me?"

"There's something else, papa."

"Well, nothing definite. The draft, you know, begins on Saturday of this week. I shall not
have any rest of mind till this ordeal is over. Outwardly all is comparatively quiet. So is
a powder magazine till a spark ignites it. This unpopular measure of the draft is to be enforced
while all our militia regiments are away. I know enough about what is said and thought by thousands
to fear the consequences. I wish you would spend a couple of weeks with your mother in that
quiet New-England village."

"No, papa, not till you tell me that all danger is past. How much I should have missed during
the past few days if I had been away! But for my feeling that my first duty is to you, I should
have entreated for your permission to become a hospital nurse. Papa, women should make sacrifices
and take risks in these times as well as men."

"Well, a few more days will tell the story. If the draft passes off quietly and our regiments
return, I shall breathe freely once more."

A letter was brought in, and she exclaimed, "Captain Lane's handwriting!" She tore open the
envelope and learned little more at that time than that he had escaped, reached our lines,
and gone to Washington, where he was under the care of a skilful surgeon. "In escaping, my
wound broke out again, but I shall soon be able to travel, and therefore to see you."

In order to account for Lane's absence and silence we must take up the thread of his story
where Zeb had dropped it. The cavalry force of which Captain Lane formed a part retired, taking
with it the prisoners and such of the wounded as could bear transportation; also the captured
thief. Lane was prevented by his wound from carrying out his threat, which his position as
chief officer of an independent command would have entitled him to do. The tides of war swept
away to the north, and he was left with the more seriously wounded of both parties in charge
of the assistant surgeon of his regiment. As the shades of evening fell, the place that had
resounded with war's loud alarms, and had been the scene of so much bustle and confusion, resumed
much of its old aspect of quiet and seclusion. The marks of conflict, the evidence of changes,
and the new conditions under which the family would be obliged to live, were only too apparent.
The grass on the lawn was trampled down, and there were new-made graves in the edge of the
grove. Fences were prostrate, and partly burned. Horses and live stock had disappeared.  The
negro quarters were nearly empty, the majority of the slaves having followed the Union column.
Confederate officers, who were welcome, honored guests but a few hours before, were on their
way to Washington as prisoners. Desperately wounded and dying men were in the out-buildings,
and a Union officer, the one who had led the attacking party and precipitated these events,
had begun his long fight for life in the mansion itself,--a strange and unexpected guest.

Mrs. Barkdale, the mistress of the house, could scarcely rally from her nervous shock or maintain
her courage, in view of the havoc made by the iron heel of war. Miss Roberta's heart was full
of bitterness and impotent revolt. She had the courage and spirit of her race, but she could
not endure defeat, and she chafed in seclusion and anger while her mother moaned and wept.
Miss Suwanee now became the leading spirit.

"We can't help what's happened, and I don't propose to sit down and wring my hands or pace
my room in useless anger. We were all for war, and now we know what war means. If I were a
man I'd fight; being only a woman, I shall do what I can to retrieve our losses and make the
most of what's left. After all, we have not suffered half so much as hundreds of other families.
General Lee will soon give the Northerners some of their own medicine, and before the summer
is over will conquer a peace, and then we shall be proud of our share in the sacrifices which
so many of our people have made."

"I wouldn't mind any sacrifice,--no, not of our home itself,--if we had won the victory," Roberta
replied. "But to have been made the instrument of our friends' defeat! It's too cruel. And
then to think that the man who wrought all this destruction, loss, and disgrace is under this
very roof, and must stay for weeks, perhaps!"

"Roberta, you are unjust," cried Suwanee. "Captain Lane proved himself to be a gallant, considerate
enemy, and you know it. What would you have him do? Play into our hands and compass his own
defeat? He only did what our officers would have done. The fact that a Northern officer could
be so brave and considerate was a revelation to me. We and all our property were in his power,
and his course was full of courtesy toward all except the armed foes who were seeking to destroy
him. The moment that even these became unarmed prisoners he treated them with great leniency.
Because we had agreed to regard Northerners as cowards and boors evidently doesn't make them so."

"You seem wonderfully taken with this Captain Lane."

"No," cried the girl, with one of her irresistible laughs; "but our officer friends would have
been taken with him if he had not been wounded. I'm a genuine Southern girl, so much so that
I appreciate a brave foe and true gentleman. They ravaged Pannonia, routed two Roman armies, laid
Thessaly in waste, and threatened Constantinople. The Emperor Theodosius,
A.D. 446, purchased peace by an ignominious tribute, so great as
to reduce many leading families to poverty. "The scourge of God" then
turned his steps to the more exhausted fields of the western provinces, and
invaded Gaul.

The Visigoths had there established a kingdom, hostile to the Vandal
power. The Huns and the Vandals united, with all the savage legions
which could be collected from Lapland to the Indus, against the Goths
and imperial forces under the command of Aetius.

"Never," says Thierry, [Footnote: Histoire d'Attilla, vol. i. p. 141] "since the days of Xerxes,
was there such a gathering of nations as now followed the standard of Attila, some five hundred
thousand warriors--Huns, Alans, Gepidae, Neuvi, Geloni, Bastarnae, Heruli,
Lombards, Belloniti, Rugi, some German but chiefly Asiatic tribes,
with their long quivers and ponderous lances, and cuirasses of plaited
hair, and scythes, and round bucklers, and short swords."

This heterogeneous host, from the Sarmatian plains, and the banks of the Vistula and Niemen,
extended from Basle to the mouth of the Rhine. Attila directed it against Orleans, on the
Loire, an important strategic position. Aetius went to meet him, bringing all the barbaric
auxiliaries he could collect--Britons, Franks, Burgundians, Sueves, Saxons, Visigoths. It was not so
much Roman against barbarian, as Europe against Asia, which was now
arrayed upon the plains of Champagne, for Orleans had fallen into
the hands of the Huns.

There, at Chalons, was fought the most decisive and bloody battle of that dreadful age, by which Europe
was delivered from Asia, even as at a later day the Saracens were shut out of France by Charles
Martel. "Bellum atrox, multiplex, immane, pertinax, cui simile nulla
usquam narrat antiquitas."

[Footnote: Jordanes.] Attila began the fight; on his left were the Ostrogoths under Vladimir,
on his right were the Gepidae, while in the centre were stationed the Huns, with their irresistible cavalry.
Aetius stationed the Franks and Burgundians, whose loyalty he doubted, in the centre, while
he strengthened his wings, and assumed the command of his own left. The Huns, as expected, made
their impetuous charge; the Roman army was cut in two; but the wings of Aetius overlapped the
cavalry of Attila, and drove back his wings. Attila was beaten, and Gaul was saved from the Slavonic
invaders. It is computed that three hundred thousand barbarians, on both sides, were slain--the
most fearful slaughter recorded in the whole annals of war. The discomfited king of the Huns
led back his forces to the Rhine, ravaging the cities and villages through which he passed, and
collected a new army. The following year he invaded Italy.

[Sidenote: The Roman general Aetius.]

[Sidenote: Retreat
of Attila.]

Aetius alone remained to stem the barbaric hosts.

He had won one of the greatest victories of ancient times, and sought for a reward. And considering
the brilliancy of his victory, and the greatness of his services, the marriage of his son with the princess
Eudoxia was not an unreasonable object of ambition. But his greatness
made him unpopular with the debauched court at Ravenna, and he was left
without a sufficient force to stem the invasion of the Huns. Aquileia,
the most important and strongly fortified city of Northern Italy,
for a time stood out against the attack of the barbarians, but ultimately
yielded.

Fugitives from the Venetian territory sought a refuge among the islands which skirt the northern coast of
the Adriatic--the haunts of fishermen and sea-birds. There Venice was born, which should revive
the glory of the West, and write her history upon the waves for a thousand years. Attila had
spent the spring in his attack on Aquileia, and the summer heats were unfavorable for further operations,
and his soldiers clamored for repose; but, undaunted by the ravages which sickness produced
in his army, he resolved to cross the Apennines and give a last blow to
Rome. Leo again sought the barbarians' camp, and met with more success than
he did with the Vandals. Attila consented to leave Italy in consideration
of an annual tribute, and the promise of the hand of the princess
Honoria, sister of the Emperor Valentinian, who, years before, in
a fit of female spitefulness for having been banished to Constantinople,
had sent her ring as a gage d'amour to the repulsive barbarian.

He then retired to the Danube by the passes of the Alps, where he spent the winter in bacchanalian orgies and preparations
for an invasion of the eastern provinces. But his career was suddenly
cut off by the avenging poniard of Ildigo, a Bactrian or Burgundian princess,
whom he had taken for one of his numerous wives, and whose relations
he had slain.

[Sidenote: Disasters of the Huns.]

On his death, the German tribes refused longer to serve under the
divided rule of his sons, and after a severe contest with the more
barbarous Huns, the empire of Attila disappeared as one of the great
powers of the world, and Italy was delivered forever from this plague
of locusts.

The battle of Netad, in which they suffered a disastrous defeat, was perhaps as decisive as the battle
of Chalons. They returned to Asia, or else were gradually worn out in unavailing struggles with the
Goths.

[Sidenote: The Avars.]

The Avars, a tribe
of the great Turanian race, and kindred to the Huns, a few years
after their retreat, crossed the Danube, established themselves between
that river and the Save, invaded the Greek empire, and ravaged the
provinces almost to the walls of Constantinople.

It would seem from Sheppard that the Avars had migrated from the very
centre of Asia, two thousand miles from the Caspian Sea, fleeing from the Turks
who had reduced them to their sway. [Footnote: Sheppard, Lect. iv.] In their
migration to the West, they overturned every thing in their way, and spread great
alarm at Constantinople.

Justinian, then an old man, A.D. 567, purchased their peace by an annual tribute and the grant of lands.
In 582, the Avar empire was firmly established on the Danube, and in the valleys of the Balkan. But
it was more hostile to the Slavic tribes, than to the Byzantine Greeks,
who then occupied the centre and southeast of Europe, and who were
reduced to miserable slavery.

With the Franks, the Avars also came in conflict, and, after various fortunes,
were subdued by Charlemagne.

Their subsequent history cannot here be pursued, until they were swept away from the roll of the
European nations. Moreover, it was not until after the fall of Rome, that they were formidable.

[Sidenote: Final disasters of the empire.]

[Sidenote: Imbecile emperors.]

The real drama of the fall of Rome closes with the second sack of
the city by the Vandals, since the imperial power was nearly prostrated
in the West, and shut up within the walls of Ravenna.

But Italy was the scene of great disasters for twenty years after, until the last of the emperors--Augustulus
Romulus; what a name with which to close the series of Roman emperors!--was dethroned by Odoacer, chief of the
Heruli, a Scythian tribe, and Rome was again stormed and sacked, A.D. 476. During these twenty years,
the East and the West were finally severed, and Italy was ruled by barbaric chieftains, and their domination
permanently secured. Valentinian, the last emperor of the race of
Theodosius, was assassinated in the year 455 (at the instigation
of the Senator Maximus, of the celebrated Anician family, whose wife
he had violated), a man who had inherited all the weaknesses of his
imperial house, without its virtues, and under whose detestable reign
the people were so oppressed with taxes and bound down by inquisitions
that they preferred the barbarians to the empire.

The successive reigns of Maximus, Avitus, Majorian, Severus, Anthemius, Olybrius, Glycerius,
Nepos, and Augustulus, nine emperors in twenty--one years, suggests
nothing but disorder and revolution.

The murderer of Valentinian reigned but three months, during which
Rome was sacked by the Vandals.

Avitus was raised to his vacant throne by the support of the Visigoths
of Gaul, then ruled by Theodoric, a majestic barbarian, and the most
enlightened and civilized of all the leaders of the Gothic hosts who
had yet appeared.

He fought and vanquished the Suevi, who had established themselves
in Spain, in the name of the emperor whom he had placed upon the throne,
but he really ruled on both sides of the Alps, and Avitus was merely
his puppet, and distinguished only for his infamous pleasures, although,
as a general, he had once saved the empire from the Huns.

[Sidenote: Last days of Rome.]

He was in turn deposed by Count Ricimer, a Sueve, and generalissimo
of the Roman armies, and Majorian, whom Ricimer thought to make a
tool, was placed in his stead. But he was an able and good man, and
attempted to revive the traditions of the empire, and met the fate
of all reformers in a hopeless age, doubtless under the influence
of Ricimer, who substituted Severus, a Lucanian, who perished by
poison after a reign of four years, so soon as he became distasteful
to the military subordinate, who was all-powerful at Rome, and who
ruled Italy for six years without an emperor with despotic authority.

During these six years Italy was perpetually ravaged by the Vandals, who landed and pillaged
the coast, and then retired with their booty.

Ricimer, without ships, invoked the aid of the court of Constantinople, who
imposed a Greek upon the throne of Italy. Though a man of great ability,
Anthemius, the new emperor, was unpopular with the Italians and the barbarians,
and he, again, was deposed by Ricimer, and Olybrius, a senator of the Anician
house, reigned in his stead, A.D. 472. It was then that Rome for
the third time was sacked by one of her own generals. Olybrius reigned
but a few months, and Glycerius, captain of his guard, was selected
as his successor--an appointment disagreeable to the Greek Emperor
Leo, who opposed to him Julius Nepos--a distinguished general, who
succeeded in ejecting Glycerius.

The Visigoths, offended, made war upon Roman Gaul. Julius sent against them Orestes, a Pannonian, called
the Patrician, who turned a traitor, and, on the assassination of Julius,
entered Ravenna in triumph.

His son, christened Romulus, the soldiers elevated upon a shield and
saluted Augustus; but as he was too small to wear the purple robe, they
called him Augustulus--a bitter mockery, recalling the battle of
Actium, and the foundation of Rome. He was the last of the Caesars.
It was easier to make an emperor than keep him in his place.

The bands of Orestes clamored for lands equal to a third of Italy. Orestes hesitated, and refused
the demand. The soldiers were united under Odoacer--chief of the Heruli, a general in the service of
the Patrician--one of the boldest and most unscrupulous of those mercenaries who lent their
arms in the service of the government of Ravenna.

The. standard of revolt was raised, and the barbarian army marched
against their former master.

Leaving his son in Ravenna, Orestes, himself an able general trained in the service of Attila,
went forth to meet his enemy on the Lombard plains. Unable to make a stand, he shut himself up
in Pavia, which was taken and sacked, and Orestes put to death. The
barbarians then marched to Ravenna, which they took, with the boy who
wore the purple, who was not slain as his father was, but pensioned with
six thousand crowns, and sent to a Campanian villa, which once belonged
to Sulla and Lucullus. The throne of the Caesars was hopelessly subverted,
and Odoacer was king of Italy, and portioned out its lands to his
greedy followers, A.D. 476.

He was not unworthy of his high position, but his kingdom was in a sad state of desolation, and
after a reign of fourteen years he was in turn supplanted by the superior genius of Theodoric, king
of the Ostrogoths, under whom a new era dawned upon Italy and the West, A.D. 490.

[Sidenote: Dismemberment of the empire.]

The Roman empire was now dismembered, and the various tribes of barbarians, after a contest of two hundred
years were fairly settled in its provinces.

[Sidenote: The settlement of the Ostrogoths in Italy.]

In Italy we find the Ostrogoths as a dominant power, who, migrating
from the mouth of the Danube, with all the barbarians they could
enlist under the standard of Theodoric, prevailed over Odoacer, and
settled in Italy.

The Gothic kingdom was assailed afterward by Belisarius and Narses, the great generals of Justinian,
also by the Lombards under Alboin, who maintained themselves in the north of Italy.

[Sidenote: The settlement of the franks in Gaul.]

Gaul was divided among the Franks, the Burgundians, and the Visigoths, whose perpetual wars, and
whose infant kingdom, it is not my object to present.

[Sidenote: The settlement of the Saxons in Britain.]

Britain was possessed by the Saxons, Spain by the Vandals, Suevi, and Visigoths, and Africa by the
Vandals, while the whole eastern empire fell into the hands of the Saracens, except Constantinople,
which preserved the treasures of Greek and Roman civilization, until the barbarians, elevated by the Christian
religion, were prepared to ingraft it upon their own rude laws and customs.

It would be interesting to trace the various fortunes of these Teutonic tribes in the devastated
provinces which they possessed by conquest. But this would lead us into a boundless field, foreign to our inquiry.
It is the fall of Rome, not the reconstruction by the new races,
which I seek to present. It would also be interesting to survey the old
capital of the world in the hands of her various masters, pillaged
and sacked by all in turn; but her doom was sealed when Alaric entered
the gates which had been closed for six hundred years to a foreign
enemy, and the empire fell, virtually, when the haughty city, so long
a queen among the nations, yielded up her palaces as spoil.

The eastern empire had a longer life, but it was inglorious when Rome
was no longer the superior city.

[Sidenote: Reflections on the fall of the empire.]

The story of the fall of the grandest empire ever erected on our earth
is simple and impressive. Genius, energy, and patience led to vast possessions,
which were retained by a uniform policy which nothing could turn aside.
Prosperity and success led to boundless self-exaggeration and a depreciation
of enemies, while the vices of self-interest undermined gradually
all real strength.

Society became utterly demoralized and weakened, and there were no conservative
forces sufficiently, strong to hold it together. Vitality was destroyed
by disproportionate fortunes, by slavery, by the extinction of the
middle classes, by the degradation of woman, by demoralizing excitements,
by factitious life, by imperial misrule, by proconsular tyranny, by
enervating vices, by the absence of elevated sentiments, by an all-
engrossing abandonment to money-making and the pleasures it procured,
so that no lofty appeal could be made to which the degenerate people
would listen, or which they could understand.

The empire was rotten to the core--was steeped in selfishness, sensuality, and frivolity, and the poison pervaded
all classes and orders, and descended to the extremities of the social system. What could be
done? There was no help from man. The empire was on the verge of
dissolution when the barbarians came. They only gave a shock and hastened
the fall.

The empire was ripe fruit, to be plucked by the strongest hand.

Three centuries earlier a brave resistance would have been' made,
and the barbarians would have been overthrown and annihilated or sold
as slaves.

But they were now the stronger, even with their rude weapons, and
without the arts of war which the Romans had been learning for a
thousand years.

Yet they suffered prodigious losses before they became ultimately victorious. But they persevered,
driven by necessity as well as the love of adventure and rapine. Wave
after wave was rolled back by desperate generals; but the tide returned,
and swept all away.

Fortunately, they reconstructed after they had once destroyed. They were converts of Christianity,
and had sympathy with many elements of civilization. "Some solitary sparks fell from the beautiful world
that was passed upon the night of their labors." These kindled a fire
which has never been extinguished.

They had, with all their barbarism, some great elements of character, and
in all the solid qualities of the heart, were superior to the races
they subdued.

They brought their fresh blood into the body politic, and were alive
to sentiments of religion, patriotism, and love.

They were enthusiastic, hopeful, generous, and uncontaminated by those subtle vices which ever lead to ruin.
They made innumerable mistakes, and committed inexcusable follies. But, after a long pilgrimage, and
severely disciplined by misfortunes, they erected a new fabric, established by
the beautiful union of German strength and Roman art, on the more solid foundations
of Christian truth.

* * * * *

The authorities for this chapter are not numerous.

They are the historians of the empire in its decline and miseries.
Gibbon's history is doubtless the best in English. He may be compared
with Tillemont's Hist, des Emperors.

Sheppard has written an interesting and instructing book on this period, but
it pertains especially to the rise of the new barbaric states.

Tacitus' chapter on the
Manners of the Germans should be read in connection with the wars. Gibbon
quotes largely from Ammianus Marcellinus, who is the best Latin historian
of the last days of Rome.

Zosimus is an authority, but he is brief. Procopius wrote a history
of the Vandal wars. Gregory of Tours describes the desolations in
Gaul, as well as Journandes.

The writings of Jerome, Augustine, and other fathers, allude somewhat to the
miseries and wickedness of the times. But of all the writers on this
dark and gloomy period, Gibbon is the most satisfactory and exhaustive;
nor is it probable he will soon be supplanted in a field so dreary
and sad.

[Sidenote: Nothing conservative in mere human creation.]

It is a most interesting inquiry why art, literature, science, philosophy,
and political organizations, and other trophies of the unaided reason
of man, did not prevent so mournful an eclipse of human glory as took
place upon the fall of the majestic empire of the Romans.

There can be no question that civilization achieved most splendid triumphs, even under the influence
of pagan institutions. But it was not paganism which achieved these
victories; it was the will and the reason of a noble race, in spite
of its withering effects. It was the proud reason of man which soared
to such lofty heights, and attempted to secure happiness and prosperity.
These great ends were measurably attained, and a self-sufficient philosopher
might have pointed to these victories as both glorious and permanent.

When the eyes of contemporaries rested on the beautiful and cultivated face
of nature, on commerce and ships, on military successes and triumphs,
on the glories of heroes and generals, on a subdued world, on a complicated
mechanism of social life, on the blazing wonders of art, on the sculptures
and pictures, the temples and monuments which ornamented every part
of the empire, when they reflected on the bright theories which philosophy
proposed, on the truths which were incorporated with the system of
jurisprudence, on the wondrous constitution which the experience of
ages had framed, on the genius of poets and historians, on the whole
system of social life, adorned with polished manners and the graces
of genial intercourse--when they saw that all these triumphs had
been won over barbarism, and had been constantly progressing with
succeeding generations, it seemed that the reign of peace and prosperity
would be perpetual.

It is nothing to the point whether the civilization of which all
people boasted, and in which they trusted, was superior or inferior
to that which has subsequently been achieved by the Gothic races.

The question is, Did these arts and sciences produce an influence sufficiently
strong to conserve society? That they polished and adorned individuals
cannot be questioned.

Did they infuse life into the decaying mass? Did they prolong political
existence? Did they produce valor and moral force among the masses?
Did they raise a bulwark capable of resisting human degeneracy or
barbaric violence?

Did they lead to self- restraint? Did they create a lofty public sentiment which scorned baseness
and lies? Did they so raise the moral tone of society that people were induced to make sacrifices
and noble efforts to preserve blessings which had already been secured.

[Sidenote:
Civilisation can only rise to a certain height by unabled reason.]

I have to show that the grandest empire of antiquity perished from the
same causes which destroyed Babylon and Carthage; that all the magnificent
trophies of the intellect were in vain; that the sources of moral renovation
were poisoned; that nothing worked out, practically and generally,
the good which was intended, and which enthusiasts had hoped; that
the very means of culture were perverted, and that the savor unto
life became a savor unto death.

In short, it will appear from the example of Rome, that man cannot
save himself; that he cannot originate any means of conservation
which will not be foiled and rendered nugatory by the force of human
corruption; that man, left to himself, will defeat his own purposes,
and that all his enterprises and projects will end in shame and humiliation,
so far as they are intended to preserve society.

The history of all the pagan races and countries show that only a
limited height can ever be reached, and that society is destined to
perpetual falls as well as triumphs, and would move on in circles
forever, where no higher aid comes than from man himself.

And this great truth is so forcibly borne out by facts, that those profound
and learned historians who are skeptical of the power of Christianity,
have generally embraced the theory that nations must rise and fall
to the end of time; and society will show, like the changes of nature,
only phases which have appeared before.

Their gloomy theories remind us of the perpetual swinging of a pendulum,
or the endless labors of Ixion-- circles and cycles of motion, but
no general and universal progress to a perfect state of happiness
and prosperity.

And if we were not supported by the hopes which Christianity furnishes, if we adopted the pagan
principles of Gibbon or Buckle, history would only confirm the darkest
theories. But the history of Greece and Rome and Egypt are only chapters
in the great work which Providence unfolds. They are only acts in the great
drama of universal life. Her proud, high
spirit was pleased with the fact that, while Lane abated not one jot of his well-defined loyalty
to the North and its aims, he also treated her with respect and evident admiration in her fearless
assertion of her views. She also recognized his admirable tact in preventing their talk from
verging towards a too-earnest discussion of their differences. Suwanee was delighted as she
saw him disarm her relatives, and was the life of their social hours. She never wearied in
delicately chaffing and bewildering the good-natured but rather matter-of-fact Surgeon McAllister,
and it often cost Lane much effort to keep from exploding in laughter as he saw the perplexed
and worried expression of his friend. But before the meal was over she would always reassure
her slow-witted guest by some unexpected burst of sunshine, and he afterwards would remark,
in confidence: "I say, Lane, that little 'Missy S'wanee' out-generals a fellow every time.
She attacks rear, flank, and front, all at once, and then she takes your sword in such a winsome
way that you are rather glad to surrender."

"Take care, McAllister,--take care, or you may surrender more than your sword."

"I think you are in the greater danger."

"Oh, no, I'm forearmed, and Miss Suwanee and I understand each other."

But he did not understand her, nor did she comprehend herself. Her conversation seemed as open,
and often as bright as her Southern sunshine, and his mind was cheered and delighted with it.
He did not disguise his frank, cordial regard for her, even before her mother and sister, but
it was ever blended with such a sincere respect that she was touched and surprised by it, and
they were reassured. She had told them of the place possessed by Marian in his thoughts, and
this fact, with his manner, promised immunity from all tendencies towards sentiment. Indeed,
that Suwanee should bestow anything more upon the Northern officer than kindness, a certain
chivalric hospitality, and some admiration, was among the impossibilities in their minds.

This, at the time, seemed equally true to the young girl herself. Not in the least was she
on her guard. Her keen enjoyment of his society awakened no suspicions, for she enjoyed everything
keenly. His persistence in treating her, in spite of all her nonsense and frolicsomeness, as
if she were worthy of the deepest respect and honor which manhood can pay to womanhood, ever
remained a bewildering truth, and touched the deepest chords in her nature.  Sometimes when
they sat in the light of the young moon on the veranda she revealed thoughts which surprised
him, and herself even more. It appeared to her as if a new and deeper life were awakening in
her heart, full of vague beauty and mystery. She almost believed that she was becoming good,
as he imagined. Why otherwise should she be so strangely happy and spiritually exalted? He
was developing in her a new self-respect. She now knew that he was familiar with standards
of comparison at the North of which she need not be ashamed. Even her mother and sister had
remarked, in effect, "It is evident that Captain Lane has been accustomed to the best society."
His esteem was not the gaping admiration of a boor to whom she had been a revelation.

"No," she said, "he is a revelation to me. I thought my little prejudices were the boundaries
of the world. He, who has seen the world, walks right over my prejudices as if they were nothing,
and makes me feel that I am his friend and equal, because he fancies I possess a true, noble
womanhood; and now I mean to possess it. He has made his ideal of me seem worthy and beautiful,
and it shall be my life effort to attain it. He doesn't think me a barbarian because I am a
rebel and believe in slavery. He has said that his mother and sisters would receive me with
open arms. It seems to me that I have grown years older and wiser during the last few weeks."

She did not know that her vivid, tropical nature was responding to the influence which is mightiest
even in colder climes.

CHAPTER XL.

LOVE'S TRIUMPH.

THE month of June was drawing to a close. Captain Lane, his surgeon, and a little company of
wounded men, equally with the Confederates, were only apparently forgotten. They were all watched,
and their progress towards health was noted. Any attempt at escape would have been checked
at once. The majority of the Federal soldiers could now walk about slowly, and were gaining
rapidly. Although they were not aware of the fact, the Confederate wounded, who had progressed
equally far in convalescence, were their guards, and the residents of the neighborhood were
allies in watchfulness. The Southerners were only awaiting the time, near at hand, when they
could proceed to Richmond with their prisoners. This purpose indicated no deep hostility on
the part of the rebels. Companionship in suffering had banished this feeling. A sergeant among
their number had become their natural leader, and he was in communication with guerilla officers
and other more regular authorities. They had deemed it best to let events take their course
for a time. Lee's northward advance absorbed general attention, although little as yet was
known about it on that remote plantation. The Union men were being healed and fed at no cost
to the Confederates, and could be taken away at the time when their removal could be accomplished
with the least trouble.

Lane himself was the chief cause of delay. He was doing well, but his wound was of a peculiar
nature, and any great exertion or exposure might yet cause fatal results. This fact had become
known to the rebel sergeant, and since the captain was the principal prize, and they were all
very comfortable, he had advised delay. It had been thought best not to inform the family as
to the state of affairs, lest it should in some way become known to Lane and the surgeon, and
lead to attempted escape. The Barkdales, moreover, were high-strung people, and might entertain
some chivalric ideas about turning over their guests to captivity.

"They might have a ridiculous woman's notion about the matter," said one of these secret advisers.

Lane and McAllister, however, were becoming exceedingly solicitous concerning the future. The
former did not base much hope on Suwanee's evident expectation that when he was well enough
he would go to his friends as a matter of course. He knew that he and his men were in the enemy's
hands, and that they would naturally be regarded as captives. He had a horror of going to a
Southern prison and of enduring weeks and perhaps months of useless inactivity. He and McAllister
began to hold whispered consultations. His mind revolted at the thought of leaving his men,
and of departing stealthily from the family that had been so kind. And yet if they were all
taken to Richmond he would be separated from the men, and could do nothing for them. Matter-of-fact
McAllister had no doubts or scruples.

"Of course we should escape at once if your wound justified the attempt"

On the 29th of June Lane and the surgeon walked some little distance from the house, and became
satisfied that they were under the surveillance of the rebel sergeant and his men. This fact
so troubled Lane that Suwanee noticed his abstraction and asked him in the evening what was
worrying him. The moonlight fell full on her lovely, sympathetic face.

"Miss Suwanee," he said, gravely, "I've been your guest about a month. Are you not tired of
me yet?"

"That's a roundabout way of saying you are tired of us."

"I beg your pardon: it is not. But, in all sincerity, I should be getting back to duty, were
it possible."

"Your wound is not sufficiently healed," she said, earnestly, wondering at the chill of fear
that his words had caused. "The surgeon says it is not."

"Don't you know?" he whispered.

"Know what?" she almost gasped.

"That I'm a prisoner."

She sprung to her feet and was about to utter some passionate exclamation; but he said, hastily,
"Oh, hush, or I'm lost. I believe that eyes are upon me all the time."

"Heigho!" she exclaimed, walking to the edge of the veranda, "I wish I knew what General Lee
was doing. We are expecting to hear of another great battle every day;" and she swept the vicinity
with a seemingly careless glance, detecting a dark outline behind some shrubbery not far away.
Instantly she sprung down the steps and confronted the rebel sergeant.

"What are you doing here?" she asked, indignantly.

"My duty," was the stolid reply.

"Find duty elsewhere then," she said, haughtily.

The man slunk away, and she returned to Lane, who remarked, significantly, "Now you understand me."

It was evident that she was deeply excited, and immediately she began to speak in a voice that
trembled with anger and other emotions. "This is terrible. I had not thought--indeed it cannot
be. My father would not permit it. The laws of war would apply, I suppose, to your enlisted
men, but that you and Surgeon McAllister, who have been our guests and have sat at our table,
should be taken from our hospitality into captivity is monstrous. In permitting it, I seem
to share in a mean, dishonorable thing."

"How characteristic your words and actions are!" said Lane, gently. "It would be easy to calculate
your orbit. I fear you cannot help yourself. You forget, too, that I was the means of sending
to prison even your Major Denham."

"Major Denham is nothing--" she began, impetuously, then hesitated, and he saw the rich color
mantling her face even in the moonlight. After a second or two she added: "Our officers were
captured in fair fight. That is very different from taking a wounded man and a guest."

"Not a guest in the ordinary sense of the word. You see I can be fair to your people, unspeakably
as I dread captivity. It will not be so hard for McAllister, for surgeons are not treated like
ordinary prisoners. His remaining, however, was a brave, unselfish act;" and Lane spoke in
tones of deep regret.

"It must not be," she said, sternly.

"Miss Suwanee,"--and his voice was scarcely audible,--"do you think we can be overheard?"

"No," she replied, in like tones. "Roberta and mamma are incapable of listening."

"I was not thinking of them. I must speak quickly. I don't wish to involve you, but the surgeon
and I must try to escape, for I would almost rather die than be taken prisoner. Deep as is
my longing for liberty I could not leave you without a word, and my trust in the chivalric
feeling that you have just evinced is so deep as to convince me that I can speak to you safely.
I shall not tell you anything to compromise you. You have only to be blind and deaf if you
see or hear anything."

Her tears were now falling fast, but she did not move, lest observant eyes should detect her
emotion.

"Heaven bless your good, kind heart!" he continued, in a low, earnest tone. "Whether I live
or die, I wish you to know that your memory will ever be sacred to me, like that of my mother
and one other. Be assured that the life you have done so much to save is always at your command.
Whenever I can serve you or yours you can count on all that I am or can do. Suwanee, I shall
be a better man for having known you. You don't half appreciate yourself, and every succeeding
day has only proved how true my first impressions were."

She did not answer, and he felt that it would be dangerous to prolong the interview. They entered
the house together. As they went up the stairs she pressed her handkerchief to her eyes, he
wondering at her silence and emotion. At the landing in the dusky hall-way he raised her hand
to his lips.

There was not a trace of gallantry in the act, and she knew it. It was only the crowning token
of that recognition at which she had wondered from the first. She realized that it was only
the homage of a knightly man and the final expression of his gratitude; but it overwhelmed
her, and she longed to escape with the terrible revelation which had come to her at last. She
could not repress a low sob, and, giving his hand a quick, strong pressure, she fled to her room.

"Can it be possible?" he thought. "Oh! if I have wounded that heart, however unintentionally,
I shall never forgive myself."

"Lane," whispered McAllister, when the former entered his room, "there are guards about the house."

"I'm not surprised," was the despondent reply. "We are prisoners."

"Does the family know it?"

He told him how Suwanee had detected the espionage of the rebel sergeant.

"Wouldn't she help us?"

"I shall not ask her to. I shall not compromise her with her people."

"No, by thunder! I'd rather spend my life in prison than harm her. What shall we do?"

"We must put our light out soon, and take turns in watching for the slightest opportunity.
You lie down first. I do not feel sleepy."

After making some slight preparations the doctor slept, and it was well on towards morning
before Lane's crowding thoughts permitted him to seek repose. He then wakened McAllister and
said, "There has been a stealthy relief of guards thus far, and I've seen no chance whatever."

The doctor was equally satisfied that any attempt to escape would be fruitless.

Suwanee's vigil that night was bitter and terrible, indeed. Her proud, passionate nature writhed
under the truth that she had given her heart, unsought, to a Northern officer,--to one who
had from the first made it clear that his love had been bestowed on another. She felt that
she could not blame him. His frankness had been almost equal to that of her own brothers, and
he had satisfied her that they could scarcely be more loyal to her than he would be. She could
detect no flaw in his bearing towards her. He had not disguised his admiration, his abundant
enjoyment of her society, but all expression of his regard had been tinged with respect and
gratitude rather than gallantry. He perhaps had thought that her knowledge of his attitude
towards Miss Vosburgh was an ample safeguard, if any were needed. Alas! it had been the chief
cause of her fatal blindness. She had not dreamed of danger for him or herself in their companionship.
Nothing was clearer than that he expected and wished no such result. It was well for Lane that
this was true, for she would have been a dangerous girl to trifle with.

But she recognized the truth. Before, love had been to her a thing of poetry, romance, and
dreams. Now it was a terrible reality. Her heart craved with intense longing what she felt
it could never possess.

At last, wearied and exhausted by her deep emotion, she sighed: "Perhaps it is better as it
is. Even if he had been a lover, the bloody chasm of war would have separated us, but it seems
cruel that God should permit such an overwhelming misfortune to come upon an unsuspecting,
inexperienced girl. Why was I so made that I could, unconsciously, give my very soul to this
stranger? yet he is not a stranger. Events have made me better acquainted with him than with
any other man. I know that he has kept no secrets from me. There was nothing to conceal. All
has been simple, straightforward, and honorable. It is to the man himself, in his crystal integrity,
that my heart has bowed, and then--that was his chief power--he made me feel that I was not
unworthy. He taught me to respect my own nature, and to aspire to all that was good and true.

"After all, perhaps I am condemning myself too harshly,--perhaps the truth that my heart acknowledged
such a man as master is proof that his estimate of me is not wholly wrong. Were there not some
kinship of spirit between us, this could not be; but the secret must remain between me and God."

Lane, tormented by the fear suggested by Suwanee's manner on the previous evening, dreaded
to meet her again, but at first he was reassured. Never had she been more brilliant and frolicsome
than at the breakfast-table that morning. Never had poor McAllister been more at his wits'
end to know how to reply to her bewildering sallies of good-natured badinage. Every vulnerable
point of Northern character received her delicate satire. Lane himself did not escape her light
shafts. He made no defence, but smiled or laughed at every palpable hit. The girl's pallor
troubled him, and something in her eyes that suggested suffering. There came a time when he
could scarcely think of that day without tears, believing that no soldier on either side ever
displayed more heroism than did the wounded girl.

He and the surgeon walked out again, and saw that they were watched. He found that his men
had become aware of the truth and had submitted to the inevitable. They were far from the Union
lines, and not strong enough to attempt an escape through a hostile country.  Lane virtually
gave up, and began to feel that the best course would be to submit quietly and look forward
to a speedy exchange. He longed for a few more hours with Suwanee, but imagined that she avoided
him. There was no abatement of her cordiality, but she appeared preoccupied.

After dinner a Confederate officer called and asked for Miss Roberta, who, after the interview,
returned to her mother's room with a troubled expression. Suwanee was there, calmly plying
her needle. She knew what the call meant.

"I suppose it's all right, and that we can't help ourselves," Roberta began, "but it annoys
me nevertheless. Lieutenant Macklin, who has just left, has said that our own men and the Union
soldiers are now well enough to be taken to Richmond, and that he will start with them to-morrow
morning. Of course I have no regrets respecting the enlisted men, and am glad they are going,
for they are proving a heavy burden to us; but my feelings revolt at the thought that Captain
Lane and the surgeon should be taken to prison from our home."

"I don't wonder," said Suwanee, indignantly; "but then what's the use? we can't help ourselves.
I suppose it is the law of war."

"Well, I'm glad you are so sensible about it. I feared you would feel a hundred-fold worse
than I, you and the captain have become such good friends. Indeed, I have even imagined that
he was in danger of becoming something more. I caught him looking at you at dinner as if you
were a saint 'whom infidels might adore.' His homage to our flirtatious little Suwanee has
been a rich joke from the first. I suppose, however, there may have been a vein of calculation
in it all, for I don't think any Yankee--"

"Hush," said Suwanee, hotly; "Captain Lane is still our guest, and he is above calculation.
I shall not permit him to be insulted because he has over-estimated me."

"Why, Suwanee, I did not mean to insult him. You have transfixed him with a dozen shafts of
satire to-day, and as for poor Surgeon McAllister--"

"That was to their faces," interrupted Suwanee, hastily.

"Suwanee is right," said Mrs. Barkdale, smiling. "Captain Lane has had the sense to see that
my little girl is good-hearted in spite of her nonsense."

The girl's lip was quivering but she concealed the fact by savagely biting off her thread,
and then was impassive again.

"I sincerely regret with you both," resumed their mother, "that these two gentlemen must go
from our home to prison, especially so since receiving a letter from Captain Lane, couched
in terms of the strongest respect and courtesy, and enclosing a hundred dollars in Northern
money as a slight compensation--so he phrased it--for what had been done for his men. Of course
he meant to include himself and the surgeon, but had too much delicacy to mention the fact.
He also stated that he would have sent more, but that it was nearly all they had."

"You did not keep the money!" exclaimed the two girls in the same breath.

"I do not intend to keep it," said the lady, quietly, "and shall hand it back to him with suitable
acknowledgments. I only mention the fact to convince Roberta that Captain Lane is not the typical
Yankee, and we have much reason to be thankful that men of a different stamp were not quartered
upon us. And yet," continued the matron, with a deep sigh, "you little know how sorely we need
the money. Your father's and brothers' pay is losing its purchasing power. The people about
here all profess to be very hot for the South, but when you come to buy anything from them
what they call 'Linkum money' goes ten times as far. We have never known anything but profusion,
but now we are on the verge of poverty."

"Oh, well," said Suwanee, recklessly, "starving isn't the worst thing that could happen."

"Alas! my child, you can't realize what poverty means. Your heart is as free from care as the
birds around us, and, like them, you think you will be provided for."

The girl sprung up with a ringing laugh, and kissed her mother as she exclaimed, "I'll cut
off my hair, put on one of brother Bob's old suits, and enlist;" and then she left the room.

At supper there was a constraint on all except Suwanee. Mrs.  Barkdale and Roberta felt themselves
to be in an embarrassing position. The men at the table, who had been guests so long, would
be marched away as prisoners from their door in the morning. The usages of war could not satisfy
their womanly and chivalric natures, or make them forget the courtesy and respect which, in
spite of prejudices, had won so much good-will. Lane scarcely sought to disguise his perplexity
and distress. Honest Surgeon McAllister, who knew that they all had been an awful burden, was
as troubled as some men are pleased when they get much for nothing. Suwanee appeared in a somewhat
new role. She was the personification of dignity and courtesy. She acted as if she knew all
and was aware that their guests did. Therefore levity would be in bad taste, and their only
resource was the good breeding which ignores the disagreeable and the inevitable. Her mother
looked on her with pride, and wondered at so fine an exibition of tact. She did not know that
the poor girl had a new teacher, and that she was like an inexorable general who, in a desperate
fight, summons all his reserve and puts forth every effort of mind and body.

Lane had not found a chance to say one word to Suwanee in private during the day, but after
supper she went to the piano and began to play some Southern airs with variations of her own
improvising. He immediately joined her and said, "We shall not attempt to escape; we are too
closely watched."

She did not reply.

"Miss Suwanee," he began again, and distress and sorrow were in his tones, "I hardly know how
to speak to you of what troubles me more than the thought of captivity. How can I manage with
such proud, chivalric women as you and your mother and sister? But I am not blind, nor can
I ignore the prosaic conditions of our lot. I respect your pride; but have a little mercy on
mine,--nay, let me call it bare self-respect. We have caused you the loss of your laborers,
your fields are bare, and you have emptied your larder in feeding my men, yet your mother will
not take even partial compensation. You can't realize how troubled I am."

"You, like ourselves, must submit to the fortunes of war," she replied, with a sudden gleam
of her old mirthfulness.

"A bodily wound would be a trifle compared with this," he resumed, earnestly. "O Miss Suwanee,
have I won no rights as a friend? rather, let me ask, will you not generously give me some rights?"

"Yes, Captain Lane," she said, gently, "I regard you as a friend, and I honor you as a true
man. Though the war should go on forever I should not change in these respects unless you keep
harping on this financial question."

"Friends frankly accept gifts from friends; let it be a gift then, by the aid of which you
can keep your mother from privation. Suwanee, Suwanee, why do you refuse to take this dross
from me when I would give my heart's blood to shield you from harm?"

"You are talking wildly, Captain Lane," she said, with a laugh. "Your heart belongs to Miss
Vosburgh, and therefore all its blood."

"She would be the first to demand and expect that I should risk all and give all for one to
whom I owe so much and who is so deserving."

"I require of her no such sacrifice," Suwanee replied, coldly, "nor of you either, Captain
Lane. Unforeseen circumstances have thrown us together for a time. We have exchanged all that
is possible between those so divided,--esteem and friendship. If my father thinks it best he
will obtain compensation from our government. Perhaps, in happier times, we may meet again,"
she added, her tone and manner becoming gentle once more; "and then I hope you will find me
a little more like what you have thought me to be."

"God grant that we may meet again. There, I can't trust myself to speak to you any more. Your
unaffected blending of humility and pride with rare, unconscious nobility touches my very soul.
Our leave-taking in the morning must be formal. Good-by, Suwanee Barkdale. As sure as there
is a God of justice your life will be filled full with happiness."

Instead of taking his proffered hand, she trembled, turned to the piano, and said hastily between
the notes she played: "Control yourself and listen. We may be observed. You and the surgeon
be ready to open your door and follow me at any time to-night. Hang your sword where it may
be seen through the open window. I have contrived a chance--a bare chance--of your escape.
Bow and retire."

He did so. She bent her head in a courtly manner towards him, and then went on with her playing
of Southern airs.

A moment later the rebel sergeant disappeared from some shrubbery a little beyond the parlor
window, and chuckled, "The Yankee captain has found out that he can't make either an ally or
a sweetheart out of a Southern girl; but I suspicioned her a little last night."

At two o'clock that night there was an almost imperceptible tap at Lane's door. He opened it
noiselessly, and saw Suwanee with her finger on her lips.

"Carry your shoes in your hands," she said, and then led the way down the stairs to the parlor
window. Again she whispered: "The guard here is bribed,--bribed by kindness. He says I saved
his life when he was wounded. Steal through the shrubbery to the creek-road; continue down
that, and you'll find a guide. Not a word. Good-by."

She gave her hand to the surgeon, whose honest eyes were moist with feeling, and then he dropped
lightly to the ground.

"Suwanee," began Lane.

"Hush! Go."

Again he raised her hand to his lips, again heard that same low, involuntary sob that had smote
his heart the preceding night; and then followed the surgeon. The guard stood out in the garden
with his back towards them, as, like shadows, they glided away.

On the creek-road the old colored man who worked in the garden joined them, and led the way
rapidly to the creek, where under some bushes a skiff with oars was moored. Lane slipped twenty
dollars into the old man's hand, and then he and his companion pushed out into the sluggish
current, and the surgeon took the oars and pulled quietly through the shadows of the overhanging
foliage. The continued quiet proved that their escape had not been discovered.  Food had been
placed in the boat. The stream led towards the Potomac. With the dawn they concealed themselves,
and slept during the day, travelling all the following night. The next day they were so fortunate
as to fall in with a Union scouting party, and so eventually reached Washington; but the effort
in riding produced serious symptoms in Lane's wound, and he was again doomed to quiet weeks
of convalescence, as has already been intimated to the reader.

When Mrs. Barkdale and Roberta came down the next morning they found Suwanee in the breakfast
room, fuming with apparent irritability.

"Here is that Lieutenant Macklin again," she said, "and he is very impatient, saying that his
orders are imperative, and that he is needed on some special duty. His orders are to convey
the prisoners to the nearest railroad station, and then report for some active service. From
all I can gather it is feared that the Yankees propose an attack on Richmond, now that General
Lee is away."

"It's strange that Captain Lane and the surgeon don't come down," Roberta remarked. "I truly
wish, however, that we had not to meet them again."

"Well, since it must be, the sooner the ordeal is over the better," said Suwanee, with increasing
irritation. "Captain Lane has sense enough to know that we are not responsible for his being
taken away."

"Hildy," said Mrs. Barkdale, "go up and tell the gentlemen that breakfast is ready."

In a few moments the old woman returned in a fluster and said, "I knock on de doah, and dey
ain't no answer."

"What!" exclaimed Suwanee, in the accents of surprise; then, sharply, "go and knock louder,
and wake them up," adding, "it's very strange."

Hildy came back with a scared look, and said, "I knock and knock; den I open de doah, and der'
ain't no one dere."

"They must be out in the grounds for a walk," exclaimed Roberta. "Haven't you seen them this
morning?"

"I ain't seen nuffin' nor heard nuffin'," protested the old woman.

"Girls, this is serious," said Mrs. Barkdale, rising; and she summoned Lieutenant Macklin,
who belonged to a class not received socially by the family.

"We have but this moment discovered," said the lady, "that Captain Lane and Surgeon McAllister
are not in their room. Therefore we suppose they are walking in the grounds. Will you please
inform them that breakfast is waiting?"

"Pardon me, madam, they cannot be outside, or I should have been informed."

"Then you must search for them, sir. The house, grounds, and buildings are open to you."

The fact of the prisoners' escape soon became evident, and there were haste, confusion, and
running to and fro to no purpose. Suwanee imitated Roberta so closely that she was not suspected.
Lieutenant Macklin and the rebel sergeant at last returned, giving evidence of strong vexation.

"We don't understand this," began the lieutenant.

"Neither do we," interrupted Mrs. Barkdale, so haughtily that they were abashed, although they
directed keen glances towards Suwanee, who met their scrutiny unflinchingly.

The Barkdales were not people to be offended with impunity, and the lieutenant knew it. He
added, apologetically: "You know I must do my duty, madam. I fear some of your servants are
implicated, or that guards have been tampered with."

"You are at liberty to examine any one you please."

They might as well have examined a carved, wrinkled effigy as old Cuffy, Lane's midnight guide.
"I don' know nuffin' 'tall 'bout it," he declared. "My ole woman kin tell yo' dat I went to
bed when she did and got up when she did."

The guard, bought with kindness, was as dense in his ignorance as any of the others. At last
Macklin declared that he would have to put citizens on the hunt, for his orders admitted of
no delay.

The Union prisoners, together with the Confederates, when formed in line, gave a ringing cheer
for "Missy S'wanee and the ladies," and then the old mansion was left in more than its former
isolation, and, as the younger girl felt, desolation.

She attended to her duties as usual, and then went to her piano. The words spoken the previous
evening would ever make the place dear to her. While she was there old Hildy crept in, with
her feeble step, and whispered, "I foun' dis un'er Cap'n Lane's piller."

It was but a scrap of paper, unaddressed; but Suwanee understood its significance. It contained
these words: "I can never repay you, but to discover some coin which a nature like yours can
accept has become one of my supreme ambitions. If I live, we shall meet again."

Those words formed a glimmering hope which grew fainter and fainter in the dark years which
followed.

She did not have to mask her trouble very long, for another sorrow came like an avalanche.
Close to the Union lines, on Cemetery Ridge, lay a white-haired colonel and his two tall sons.
They were among the heroes in Pickett's final charge, on the 3d of July. "Missy S'wanee" laughed
no more, even in self-defence.

CHAPTER XLI.

SUNDAY'S LULL AND MONDAY'S STORM.

SUNDAY, the 12th of July, proved a long, restful sabbath to Marian and her father, and they
spent most of its hours together. The great tension and strain of the past weeks appeared to
be over for a time.  The magnificent Union victories had brought gladness and hopefulness to
Mr. Vosburgh, and the return of her friends had relieved his daughter's mind. He now thought
he saw the end clearly. He believed that hereafter the tide of rebellion would ebb southward
until all the land should be free.

"This day has been a godsend to us both," he said to Marian, as they sat together in the library
before retiring. "The draft has begun quietly, and no disturbances have followed. I scarcely
remember an evening when the murmur of the city was so faint and suggestive of repose. I think
we can both go to the country soon, with minds comparatively at rest. I must admit that I expected
no such experience as has blessed us to-day. We needed it. Not until this respite came did
I realize how exhausted from labor and especially anxiety I had become. You, too, my little
girl, are not the blooming lassie you were a year ago."

"Yet I think I'm stronger in some respects, papa."

"Yes, in many respects. Thank God for the past year. Your sympathy and companionship have made
it a new era in my life. You have influenced other lives, also, as events have amply proved.
Are you not satisfied now that you can be unconventional without being queer? You have not
been a colorless reflection of some social set; neither have you left your home for some startling
public career; and yet you have achieved the distinct individuality which truthfulness to nature
imparts. You have simply been developing your better self naturally, and you have helped fine
fellows to make the best of themselves."

"Your encouragement is very sweet, papa. I'm not complacent over myself, however; and I've
failed so signally in one instance that I'm vexed and almost saddened. You know what I mean."

"Yes, I know," with a slight laugh. "Merwyn is still your unsolved problem, and he worries you."

"Not because he is unsolved, but rather that the solution has proved so disappointing and unexpected.
He baffles me with a trait which I recognize, but can't understand, and only admit in wonder
and angry protest. Indeed, from the beginning of our acquaintance he has reversed my usual
experiences. His first approaches incensed me beyond measure,--all the more, I suppose, because
I saw in him an odious reflection of my old spirit. But, papa, when to his condescending offer
I answered from the full bitterness of my heart, he looked and acted as if I had struck him
with a knife."

Her father again laughed, as he said: "You truly used heroic surgery, and to excellent purpose.
Has he shown any conceit, complacency, or patronizing airs since?"

"No, I admit that, at least."

"In destroying some of his meaner traits by one keen thrust, you did him a world of good. Of
course he suffered under such a surgical operation, but he has had better moral health ever since."

"Oh, yes," she burst out, "he has become an eminently respectable and patriotic millionnaire,
giving of his abundance to save the nation's life, living in a palace meanwhile. What did he
mean by his passionate words, 'I shall measure everything hereafter by the breadth of your
woman's soul'? What have the words amounted to? You know, papa, that nothing but my duty and
devotion to you keeps me from taking an active part in this struggle, even though a woman.
Indeed, the feeling is growing upon me that I must spend part of my time in some hospital.
A woman can't help having an intense conviction of what she would do were she a man, and you
know what I would have done, and he knows it also. Therefore he has not kept his word, for
he fails at the vital point in reaching my standard. I have no right to judge men in Mr. Merwyn's
position because they do not go to the front. Let them do what they think wise and prudent;
let them also keep among their own kind. I protest against their coming to me for what I give
to friends who have already proved themselves heroes. But there, I forgot. He looks so like
a man that I can't help thinking that he is one,--that he could come up to my standard if he
chose to. He still seeks me--"

"No, he has not been here since he heard Blauvelt's story."

"He passed the house once, hesitated, and did not enter. Papa, he has not changed, and you
know it. He has plainly asked for a gift only second to what I can give to God. With a tenacity
which nothing but his will can account for, perhaps, he seeks it still. Do you think his distant
manner deceives me for a moment? Nor has my coldness any influence on him. Yet it has not been
the coldness of indifference, and he knows that too. He has seen and felt, like sword-thrusts,
my indignation, my contempt. He has said to my face, 'You think me a coward.' He is no fool,
and has fully comprehended the situation. If he had virtually admitted, 'I am a coward, and
therefore can have no place among the friends who are surpassing your ideal of manly heroism,'
and withdrawn to those to whom a million is more than all heroism, the affair would have ended
naturally long ago. But he persists in bringing me a daily sense of failure and humiliation.
He says: 'My regard for you is so great I can't give you up, yet not so great as to lead me
to do what hundreds of thousands are doing. I can't face danger for your sake.' I have tried
to make the utmost allowance for his constitutional weakness, yet it has humiliated me that
I had not the power to enable him to overcome so strange a failing. Why, I could face death
for you, and he can't stand beside one whom he used to sneer at as 'little Strahan.' Yet, such
is his idea of my woman's soul that he still gives me his thoughts and therefore his hopes;"
and she almost stamped her foot in her irritation.

"Would you truly give your life for me?" he asked, gently.

"Yes, I know I could, and would were there necessity; not in callous disregard of danger, but
because the greater emotion swallows up the less. Faulty as I am, there would be no bargainings
and prudent reservations in my love. These are not the times for half-way people. Oh think,
papa, while we are here in the midst of every comfort, how many thousands of mutilated, horribly
wounded men are dying in agony throughout the South! My heart goes out to them in a sympathy
and homage I can't express. Think how Lane and even Strahan may be suffering to-night, with
so much done for them, and then remember the prisoners of war and the poor unknown enlisted
men, often terribly neglected, I fear. Papa, won't you let me go as a nurse? The ache would
go out of my own heart if I tried to reduce this awful sum of anguish a little. He whose word
and touch always banished pain and disease would surely shield me in such labors. As soon as
danger no longer threatens you, won't you let me do a little, although I am only a girl?"

"Yes, Marian," her father replied, gravely; "far be it from me to repress such heaven-born
impulses. You are now attaining the highest rank reached by humanity. All the avenues of earthly
distinction cannot lead beyond the spirit of self-sacrifice for others. This places you near
the Divine Man, and all grow mean and plebeian to the degree that they recede from him. You
see what comes of developing your better nature. Selfishness and its twin, cowardice, are crowded
out."

"Please don't praise me any more. I can't stand it," faltered the girl, tearfully. A moment
later her laugh rang out. "Hurrah!" she cried, "since Mr. Merwyn won't go to the war, I'm going
myself."

"To make more wounds than you will heal," her father added. "Remember the circumstances under
which you go will have to receive very careful consideration, and I shall have to know all
about the matron and nurses with whom you act. Your mother will be horrified, and so will not
a few of your acquaintances. Flirting in shadows is proper enough, but helping wounded soldiers
to live--But we understand each other, and I can trust you now."

The next morning father and daughter parted with few misgivings, and the latter promised to
go to her mother in a day or two, Mr. Vosburgh adding that if the week passed quietly he could
join them on Saturday evening.

So they quietly exchanged their good-by kiss on the edge of a volcano already in eruption.

An early horseback ride in Central Park had become one of Merwyn's habits of late. At that
hour he met comparatively few abroad, and the desire for solitude was growing upon him. Like
Mr. Vosburgh, he had watched with solicitude the beginning of the draft, feeling that if it
passed quietly his only remaining chance would be to wring from his mother some form of release
from his oath. Indeed, so unhappy and desperate was he becoming that he had thought of revealing
everything to Mr. Vosburgh. The government officer, however, might feel it his duty to use
the knowledge, should there come a time when the authorities proceeded against the property
of the disloyal. Moreover, the young man felt that it would be dishonorable to reveal the secret.

Beyond his loyal impulses he now had little motive for effort. Marian's prejudices against
him had become too deeply rooted, and her woman's honor for the knightly men her friends had
proved too controlling a principle, ever to give him a chance for anything better than polite
tolerance. He had discovered what this meant so fully, and in Blauvelt's story had been shown
the inevitable contrast which she must draw so vividly, that he had decided:--

"No more of Marian Vosburgh's society until all is changed.  Therefore no more forever, probably.
If my mother proves as obdurate as a Southern jailer, I suppose I'm held, although I begin
to think I have as good cause to break my chains as any other Union man. She tricked me into
captivity, and holds me remorselessly,--not like a mother. Miss Vosburgh did show she had a
woman's heart, and would have given me her hand in friendship had I not been compelled to make
her believe that I was a coward. If in some way I can escape my oath, and my reckless courage
at the front proves her mistaken, I may return to her. Otherwise it is a useless humiliation
and pain to see her any more."

Such had been the nature of his musings throughout the long Sunday whose quiet had led to the
belief that the draft would scarcely create a ripple of overt hostility. During his ride on
Monday morning he nearly concluded to go to his country place again. He was growing nervous
and restless, and he longed for the steadying influence of his mountain rambles before meeting
his mother and deciding questions which would involve all their future relations.

As with bowed head, lost in thought, he approached the city by one of the park entrances, he
heard a deep, angry murmur, as if a storm-vexed tide was coming in. Spurring his horse forward,
he soon discovered, with a feeling like an electric shock, that a tide was indeed rising. Was
it a temporary tidal wave of human passion, mysterious in its origin, soon to subside, leaving
such wreckage as its senseless fury might have caused? Or was it the beginning of the revolution
so long feared, but not now guarded against?

Converging from different avenues, men, women, and children were pouring by the thousand into
a vacant lot near the park. Their presence seemed like a dream. Why was this angry multitude
gathering here within a few rods of rural loveliness, their hoarse cries blending with the
songs of robins and thrushes? It had been expected that the red monster would raise its head,
if at all, in some purlieu of the east side. On the contrary its segregate parts were coming
together at a distance from regions that would naturally generate them, and were forming under
his very eyes the thing of which he had read, and, of late, had dreamed night and day,--a mob.

To change the figure, the vacant space, unbuilt upon as yet, was becoming an immense human
reservoir, into which turgid streams with threatening sounds were surging from the south. His
eyes could separate the tumultuous atoms into ragged forms, unkempt heads, inflamed faces,
animated by some powerful destructive impulse. Arms of every description proved that the purpose
of the gathering was not a peaceful one. But what was the purpose?

Riding closer he sought to question some on the outskirts of the throng, and so drew attention
to himself. Volleys of oaths, stones, and sticks, were the only answers he received.

"Thank you," Merwyn muttered, as he galloped away. "I begin to comprehend your meaning, but
shall study you awhile before I take part in the controversy. Then there shall be some knock-down
arguments."

As he drew rein at a short distance the cry went up that he was a "spy," and another rush was
made for him; but he speedily distanced his pursuers. To his surprise the great multitude turned
southward, pouring down Fifth and Sixth avenues. After keeping ahead for a few blocks, he saw
that the mob, now numbering many thousands, was coming down town with some unknown purpose
and destination.

Two things were at least clear,--the outbreak was unexpected, and no preparation had been made
for it. As he approached his home on a sharp trot, a vague air of apprehension and expectation
was beginning to manifest itself, and but little more. Policemen were on their beats, and the
city on the fashionable avenues and cross-streets wore its midsummer aspect. Before entering
his own home he obeyed an impulse to gallop by the Vosburgh residence. All was still quiet,
and Marian, with surprise, saw him clattering past in a way that seemed reckless and undignified.

On reaching his home he followed his groom to the stable, and said, quietly: "You are an old
family servant, but you must now give me positive assurance that I can trust you. There is
a riot in the city, and there is no telling what house will be safe. Will you mount guard night
and day in my absence?"

"Faix, sur, I will. Oi'll sarve ye as I did yer fayther afore ye."

"I believe you, but would shoot you if treacherous. You know I've been expecting this trouble.
Keep the horse saddled. Bar and bolt everything. I shall be in and out at all hours, but will
enter by the little side-door in the stable. Watch for my signal, and be ready to open to me
only any door, and bolt it instantly after me. Leave all the weapons about the house just where
I have put them. If any one asks for me, say I'm out and you don't know when I'll be back.
Learn to recognize my voice and signal, no matter how disguised I am."

The faithful old servant promised everything, and was soon executing orders. Before their neighbors
had taken the alarm, the heavy shutters were closed, and the unusual precautions that in the
family's absence had been adopted rendered access possible only to great violence. On reaching
his room Merwyn thought for a few moments. He was intensely excited, and there was a gleam
of wild hope in his eyes, but he felt with proud exultation that in his manner he was imitating
his father. Not a motion was hasty or useless. Right or wrong, in the solitude of his room
or in the midst of the mob, his brain should direct his hand.

"And now my hand is free!" he exclaimed, aloud; "my oath cannot shackle it now."

His first conclusion was to mingle with the mob and learn the nature and objects of the enemy.
He believed the information would be valuable to Mr. Vosburgh and the police authorities. Having
accomplished this purpose he would join any organized resistance he could find, at the same
time always seeking to shield Marian from the possibility of danger.

He had already been shown that in order to understand the character and aims of the mob he
must appear to be one of them, and he decided that he could carry off the disguise of a young
city mechanic better than any other.

This plan he carried out by donning from his own wardrobe a plain dark flannel suit, which,
when it had been rolled in dust and oil, and received a judicious rip here and there, presented
the appearance of a costume of a workman just from his shop. With further injunctions to Thomas
and the old serving-woman, he made his way rapidly to the north-east, where the smoke of a
conflagration proved that the spirit of mischief was increasing.

One would not have guessed, as he hurried up Third Avenue, that he was well armed, but there
were two small, yet effective revolvers and a dirk upon his person. As has been related before,
he had practised for this emergency, and could be as quick as a flash with his weapon.

He had acted with the celerity of youth, guided by definite plans, and soon began to make his
way quietly through the throng that blocked the avenue, gradually approaching the fire at the
corner of 45th Street. At first the crowd was a mystery to him, so orderly, quiet, and inoffensive
did it appear, although composed largely of the very dregs of the slums. The crackling, roaring
flames, devouring tenement-houses, were equally mysterious. No one was seeking to extinguish
them, although the occupants of the houses were escaping for their lives, dragging out their
humble effects. The crowd merely looked on with a pleased, satisfied expression. After a moment's
thought Merwyn remembered that the draft had been begun in one of the burning houses, and was
told by a bystander, "We smashed the ranch and broke some jaws before the bonfire."

That the crowd was only a purring tiger was soon proved, for some one near said, "There's Kennedy,
chief of the cops;" and it seemed scarcely a moment before the officer was surrounded by an
infuriated throng who were raining curses and blows upon him.

Merwyn made an impulsive spring forward in his defence, but a dozen forms intervened, and his
effort was supposed to be as hostile as that of the rioters. The very numbers that sought to
destroy Kennedy gave him a chance, for they impeded one another, and, regaining his feet, he
led a wild chase across a vacant lot, pursued by a hooting mob as if he were a mad dog. The
crowd that filled the street almost as far as eye could reach now began to sway back and forth
as if coming under the influence of some new impulse, and Merwyn was so wedged in that he had
to move with the others. Being tall he saw that Kennedy, after the most brutal treatment, was
rescued almost by a miracle, apparently more dead than alive. It also became clear to him that
the least suspicion of his character and purpose would cost him his life instantly. He therefore
resolved on the utmost self-control. He was ready to risk his life, but not to throw it away
uselessly,--not at least till he knew that Marian was safe. It was his duty now to investigate
the mob, not fight it.

The next excitement was caused by the cry, "The soldiers are coming!"

These proved to be a small detachment of the invalid corps, who showed their comprehension
of affairs by firing over the rioters' heads, thinking to disperse them by a little noise.
The mob settled the question of noise by howling as if a menagerie had broken loose, and, rushing
upon the handful of men, snatched their muskets, first pounding the almost paralyzed veterans,
and then chasing them as a wilderness of wolves would pursue a small array of sheep.

As Merwyn stepped down from a dray, whereon he had witnessed the scene, he muttered, indiscreetly,
"What does such nonsense amount to!"

A big hulking fellow, carrying a bar of iron, who had stood beside him, and who apparently
had had his suspicions, asked, fiercely, "An' what did ye expect it wud amount to? An' what's
the nonsense ye're growlin' at? By the holy poker oi belave you're a spy."

"Yis, prove that, and I'll cut his heart out," cried an inebriated woman, brandishing a knife
a foot long.

"Yes, prove it, you thunderin' fool!" cried Merwyn.

"The cops are comin' now, and you want to begin a fight among ourselves."

True enough, the cry came ringing up the avenue, "The cops comin.'"

"Oh, an' ye's wan uv us, oi'll stan' by ye; but oi've got me eye on ye, and 'ud think no more
o' brainin' ye than a puppy."

"Try brainin' the cops first, if yer know when yer well off," replied Merwyn, drawing a pistol.
"I didn't come out to fight bullies in our crowd."

The momentary excitement caused by this altercation was swallowed up by the advent of a squad
of police, which wheeled into the avenue from 43d Street, and checked the pursuit of the bleeding
remnants of the invalid corps. Those immediately around the young man pressed forward to see
what took place, he following, but edging towards the sidewalk, with the eager purpose to see
the first fight between the mob and the police.

CHAPTER XLII.

THAT WORST OF MONSTERS, A MOB.

AFTER reaching the sidewalk Merwyn soon found a chance to mount a dry-goods box, that he might
better observe the action of the police and form an idea of their numbers. The moment he saw
the insignificant band he felt that they were doomed men, or else the spirit abroad was not
what he thought it to be, and he had been witnessing some strong indications of its ruthless
nature.

It was characteristic of the young fellow that he did not rush to the aid of the police. He
was able, even in that seething flood of excitement, to reason coolly, and his thoughts were
something to this effect: "I'm not going to throw away my life and all its chances and duties
because the authorities are so ignorant as to sacrifice a score or two of their men. I shall
not fight at all until I have seen Marian and Mr. Vosburgh. When I have done something to insure
their safety, or at least to prove that I am not a coward, I shall know better what to do and
how to do it. This outbreak is not an affair of a few hours. She herself may be exposed to
the fury of these fiends, for I believe her father is, or will be, a marked man."

Seeing, farther up the avenue, a small balcony as yet unoccupied, he pushed his way towards
it, that he might obtain one more view of the drift of affairs before taking his course. The
hall-door leading to the second story was open and filled with a crowd of frightened, unkempt
women and children, who gave way before him. The door of the room opening on the balcony was
locked, and, in response to his repeated knockings, a quavering voice asked what was wanted.

"You must open instantly," was his reply.

A trembling, gray-haired woman put the door ajar, and he pushed in at once, saying: "Bolt the
door again, madam. I will do you no harm, and may be able to save you from injury;" and he
was out in the balcony before his assurances were concluded.

"Indeed, sir, I've done no one any wrong, and therefore need no protection. I only wish to
be let alone with my children."

"That you cannot expect with certainty, in view of what is going on to-day. Do you not know
that they are burning houses? As long as I'm here I'll be a protection. I merely wish the use
of this little outlook for a brief time. So say nothing more, for I must give my whole attention
to the fight."

"Well then, since you are so civil, you can stay; but the street is full of devils."

He paid no heed to her further lamentations, and looking southward saw that the police had
formed a line across the avenue, and that such battered remnants of the invalid corps as had
escaped were limping off behind their cover as fast as possible. The presence of the city's
guardians had caused a brief hesitation in the approaching and broken edge of the rabble. Seeing
this the brave sergeant ordered a charge, which was promptly and swiftly made, the mob recoiling
before it more and more slowly as under pressure it became denser. There was no more effort
to carry out the insane, rather than humane, tactics of the invalid corps, who had either fired
high or used blank cartridges, for now the police struck for life with their locust clubs,
and the thud of the blows could often be heard even above the uproar. Every one within reach
of their arms went down, and the majority lay quietly where they fell, as the devoted little
band pressed slowly forward. With regret Merwyn saw Barney Ghegan among the foremost, his broad
red face streaming with perspiration, and he wielding his club as if it were the deadliest
of shillalahs.

They did indeed strike manfully, and proved what an adequate force could do. Rioters fell before
them on every side. But hopeless reaping was theirs, with miles of solid, bloodthirsty humanity
before them. Slowly and more falteringly they made their way three blocks, as far as 46th Street,
sustained by the hope of finding reinforcements there. Instead of these, heavier bodies of
the enemy poured in from the side-streets upon the exhausted men, and the mob closed behind
them from 45th Street, like dark, surging waves. Then came a mad rush upon the hemmed-in officers,
who were attacked in front and in the rear, with clubs, iron-bars, guns, and pistols.  Tom,
bruised, bleeding, the force that had fought so gallantly broke, each man striking out for
his own life. The vast heterogeneous crowd now afforded their chief chance for escape. Dodging
behind numbers, taking advantage of the wild confusion of the swaying, trampling masses, and
striking down some direct opponent, a few got off with slight bruises. There were wonderful
instances of escape. The brave sergeant who had led the squad had his left wrist broken by
an iron bar, but, knocking down two other assailants, he sprung into a house and bolted the
door after him. An heroic German girl, with none of the stolid phlegm attributed to her race,
lifted the upper mattress of her bed. The sergeant sprung in and was covered up without a word.
There was no time then for plans and explanations. A moment later the door was broken, and
a score of fierce-visaged men streamed in. Now the girl was stolidity itself.

"Der cop run out der back door," was all that she could be made to say in answer to fierce
inquiries. Every apartment was examined in vain, and then the roughs departed in search of
other prey. Brave, simple-hearted girl! She would have been torn to pieces had her humane strategy
been discovered.

But a more memorable act of heroism was reserved for another woman, Mrs. Eagan, the wife of
the man who had rescued Superintendent Kennedy a short time before. A policeman was knocked
down with a hay-bale rung, and fell at her very feet. In a moment more he would have been killed,
but this woman instantly covered his form with her own, so that no blow could reach him unless
she was first struck. Then she begged for his life. Even the wild-beast spirit of the mob was
touched, and the pursuers passed on. A monument should have been built to the woman who, in
that pandemonium of passion, could so risk all for a stranger.

I am not defending Merwyn's course, but sketching a character. His spirit of strategical observation
would have forsaken him had he witnessed that scene, and indeed it did forsake him as he saw
Barney Ghegan running and making a path for himself by the terrific blows of his club. Three
times he fell but rose again, with the same indomitable pluck which had won his suit to pretty
Sally Maguire. At last the brave fellow was struck down almost opposite the balcony. Merwyn
knew the man was a favorite of the Vosburghs, and he could not bear that the brave fellow should
be murdered before his very eyes; yet murdered he apparently was ere Merwyn could reach the
street. Like baffled fiends his pursuers closed upon the unfortunate man, pounding him and
jumping upon him. And almost instantly the vile hags that followed the marauders like harpies,
for the sake of plunder began stripping his body.

"Stop!" thundered Merwyn, the second he reached the scene, and, standing over the prostrate
form, he levelled a pistol at the throng. "Now, listen to me," he added. "I don't wish to hurt
anybody. You've killed this man, so let his body alone. I know his wife, an Irishwoman, and
she ought at least to have his body for decent burial."

"Faix, an he's roight," cried one, who seemed a leader. "We've killed the man. Let his woife
have what's left uv 'im;" and the crowd broke away, following the speaker.

This was one of the early indications of what was proved afterwards,--that the mob was hydra-headed,
following either its own impulses or leaders that sprung up everywhere.

An abandoned express-wagon stood near, and into this Merwyn, with the help of a bystander,
lifted the insensible man. The young fellow then drove, as rapidly as the condition of the
streets permitted, to the nearest hospital. A few yards carried him beyond those who had knowledge
of the affair, and after that he was unmolested. It was the policy of the rioters to have the
bodies of their friends disappear as soon as possible. Poor Ghegan had been stripped to his
shirt and drawers, and so was not recognized as a "cop."

Leaving him at the hospital, with brief explanations, Merwyn was about to hasten away, when
the surgeon remarked, "The man is dead, apparently."

"I can't help it," cried Merwyn. "I'll bring his wife as soon as possible. Of course you will
do all in your power;" and he started away on a run.

A few moments later Barney Ghegan was taken to the dead-house.

CHAPTER XLIII.

THE "COWARD."

MERWYN now felt that he had carried out the first part of his plan. He had looked into the
murderous eyes of the mob, and learned its spirit and purpose. Already he reproached himself
for leaving Marian alone so long, especially as columns of smoke were rising throughout the
northern part of the city. It seemed an age since he had seen that first cloud of the storm,
as he emerged from the park after his quiet ride, but it was not yet noon.

As he sped through the streets, running where he dared, and fortunately having enough of the
general aspect of a rioter to be unmolested, he noticed a new feature in the outbreak, one
that soon became a chief characteristic,--the hatred of negroes and the sanguinary pursuit
of them everywhere.

"Another danger for the Vosburghs," he groaned. "They have a colored servant, who must be spirited
off somewhere instantly."

Avoiding crowds, he soon reached the quiet side-street on which Marian lived, and was overjoyed
to find it almost deserted. Mammy Borden herself answered his impatient ring, and was about
to shut the door on so disreputable a person as he now appeared to be, when he shouldered it
open, turned, locked and chained it with haste.

"What do you mean, sir? and who are you?" Marian demanded, running from the parlor on hearing
the expostulations of her servant.

"Have patience, Miss Vosburgh."

"Oh, it is you, Mr. Merwyn. Indeed I have need of patience. An hour ago papa sent a message
from down town, saying: 'Don't leave the house to-day. Serious trouble on foot.' Since then
not a word, only wild-looking people running through the street, the ringing of fire-bells,
and the sounds of some kind of disturbance. What does it all mean? and why do you bar and bolt
everything so timidly?" and the excited girl poured out her words in a torrent.

Merwyn's first words were exasperating, and the girl had already passed almost beyond self-control.
"Has any one seen your colored servant to-day?"

"What if they have? What does your unseemly guise mean? Oh that my brave friends were here
to go out and meet the rabble like soldiers! There's an outbreak, of course; we've been expecting
it; but certainly MEN should not fear the canaille of the slums. It gives me a sickening impression,
Mr. Merwyn, to see you rush in, almost force your way in, and disguised too, as if you sought
safety by identifying yourself with those who would quail before a brave, armed man. Pardon
me if I'm severe, but I feel that my father is in danger, and if I don't hear from him soon
I shall take Mammy Borden as escort and go to his office. Whoever is abroad, they won't molest
women, and I'M NOT AFRAID."

"By so doing you would disobey your father, who has told you not to leave the house to-day."

"But I can't bear inaction and suspense at such a time."

"You must bear it, Miss Vosburgh. Seeing the mood you are in, I shall not permit that door
to be opened to any one except your father or some one that you recognize."

"You cannot help yourself," she replied, scornfully, approaching the door.

He was there before her, and, taking out the key, put it in his pocket.

"Oh, this is shameful!" she cried, blushing scarlet "Can your fears carry you so far?"

"Yes, and much farther, if needful," he replied, with a grim laugh. "When you are calm enough
to listen to me, to be sane and just, I'll explain. Until you are I shall remain master here
and protect you and your home." Then, in a tone of stern authority, he added: "Mrs.  Borden,
sit yonder in that darkened parlor, and don't move unless I tell you to hide. Then hide in
earnest, as you value your life."

"Would you not also like a hiding-place provided, Mr. Merwyn?" Marian asked, almost beside
herself with anger and anxiety.

His reply was to go to the window and look up and down the still quiet street.

"A respite," he remarked, then turned to the colored woman, and in a tone which she instantly
obeyed, said, "Go to that parlor, where you cannot be seen from the street." Then to Marian,
"I have no authority over you."

"No, I should hope not. Is there no escape from this intrusion?"

"None for the present," he replied, coldly. "You settled it long since that I was a coward,
and now that I am not a gentleman. I shall make no self-defence except to your father, whom
I expect momentarily. He cannot leave you alone to-day an instant longer than is unavoidable.
I wish to remind you of one thing, however: your soldier friends have long been your pride."

"Oh that these friends were here to day!"

"They would be surprised at your lack of quiet fortitude."

"Must I be humiliated in my own home?"

"You are humiliating yourself. Had you treated me with even your old cool toleration and civility,
I would have told you all that has happened since morning; but you have left me no chance for
anything except to take the precautions heedful to save your home and yourself. You think I
fled here as a disguised fugitive. When shall I forget this crowning proof of your estimate
and esteem? You see I did not come unarmed," partially drawing a revolver. "I repeat, you are
proud of your soldier friends. You have not learned that the first duty of a soldier is to
obey orders; and you have your father's orders. Obey them quietly, and you are under no necessity
to speak to me again. When your father comes I will relieve you of my hated presence. If he
wishes it, I will still serve you both for his sake, for he always kept a little faith and
fairness for me. Now, regard me as a sentinel, a common soldier, to whom you need not speak
until your father comes;" and he turned to the windows and began fastening them.

He, too, was terribly incensed. He had come to interpose his life between her and danger, and
her words and manner had probed a deep wound that had long been bleeding. The scenes he had
witnessed had wrought him up to a mood as stern and uncompromising as the death he soon expected
to meet. When utterly off her guard she had shown him, as he believed, her utter contempt and
detestation, and at that moment there was not a more reckless man in the city.

But his bitter words and indomitable will had quieted her As he stood motionless upon guard
by the window, his was not the attitude of a cowering fugitive. She now admitted that her wild
excitement and her disposition to rush to her father, contrary to his injunction, were unworthy
of her friends and of herself.

There had been panic that morning in the city, and she had caught the contagion in a characteristic
way. She had had no thought of hiding and cowering, but she had been on the eve of carrying
out rash impulses. She had given way to uncontrollable excitement; and if her father should
learn all she feared he would send her from the city as one not to be trusted. What should
she think of that silent, motionless sentinel at the window? Suppose, after all, she had misunderstood
and misjudged him,--suppose he HAD come for her protection. In view of this possibility which
she had now to entertain, how grossly she had insulted him! If her father came and approved
of his course, how could she ever look one so wronged in the face again? She must try to soften
her words a little.  Woman-like, she believed that she could certainly soothe a man as far
as she deemed it judicious, and then leave the future for further diplomacy. Coward, or not,
he had now made her afraid of him.

"Mr. Merwyn," she began.

He made no response whatever.

Again, in a lower and more timid voice, she repeated his name.

Without turning, he said: "Miss Vosburgh, I'm on guard. You interfere with my duty. There is
no reason for further courtesies between us. If you are sufficiently calm, aid Mrs. Borden
in packing such belongings as she actually needs. She must leave this house as soon as possible."

"What!" cried the girl, hotly, "send this faithful old woman out into the streets? Never."

"I did not say, 'out into the streets.' When your father comes one of his first efforts will
be to send her to a place of safety. No doubt he has already warned her son to find a hiding-place."

"Great heavens! why don't you explain?"

"What chance have I had to explain? Ah! come here, and all will be plain enough."

She stood at his side and saw a gang of men and boys' chasing a colored man, with the spirit
of bloodhounds in their tones and faces.

"Now I'se understan', too, Mass'r Merwyn," said the trembling colored woman, looking over their
shoulders.

"Go back," he said, sternly. "If you were seen, that yelling pack of fiends would break into
this house as if it were paste-board. Obey orders, both of you, and keep out of sight."

Awed, overwhelmed, they stole to the back parlor; but Marian soon faltered, "O Mr. Merwyn,
won't you forgive me?"

He made no reply, and a moment later he stepped to the door. Mr. Vosburgh hastily entered,
and Marian rushed into his arms.

"What, Merwyn! you here? Thank God my darling was not alone! Well, Merwyn, you've got to play
the soldier now, and so have we all."

"I shall not 'play the soldier';" was the reply, in quick, firm utterance. "But no matter about
me, except that my time is limited. I wish to report to you certain things which I have seen,
and leave it to your decision whether I can serve you somewhat, and whether Miss Vosburgh should
remain in the city. I would also respectfully suggest that your colored servant be sent out
of town at once. I offer my services to convey her to New Jersey, if you know of a near refuge
there, or else to my place in the country."

"Good God, Merwyn! don't you know that by such an act you take your life in your hand?"

"I have already taken it in my hand, an open hand at that. It has become of little value to
me. But we have not a second to lose. I have a very sad duty to perform at once, and only stayed
till you came. If you have learned the spirit abroad to-day, you know that your household was
and is in danger."

"Alas! I know it only too well. The trouble had scarcely begun before I was using agents and
telegraph wires. I have also been to police headquarters. Only the sternest sense of duty to
the government kept me so long from my child; but a man at Washington is depending on me for
information."

"So I supposed. I may be able to serve you, if you can bring yourself to employ a coward. I
shall be at police headquarters, and can bring you intelligence. When not on duty you should
be in the streets as little as possible. But, first, I would respectfully suggest that Miss
Vosburgh retire, for I have things to say to you which she should not hear."

"This to me, who listened to the story of Gettysburg?"

"All was totally different then."

"And I, apparently, was totally different. I deserve your reproach; I should be sent to the
nursery."

"I think you should go and help Mrs. Borden," said Merwyn, quietly.

"It's impossible to send Mammy Borden away just yet,--not till darkness comes to aid our effort,"
said Mr. Vosburgh, decisively. "You can serve me greatly, Merwyn, and your country also, if
you have the nerve. It will require great risks. I tell you so frankly. This is going to prove
worse than open battle. O Marian, would to God you were with your mother!"

"In that case I would come to you if I had to walk. I have wronged and insulted you, Mr. Merwyn;
I beg your pardon. Now don't waste another moment on me, for I declare before God I shall remain
with my father unless taken away by force; and you would soon find that the most fatal course
possible."

"Well, these are lurid times. I dreaded the thing enough, but now that it has come so unexpectedly,
it is far worse--But enough of this. Mr. Merwyn, are you willing to take the risks that I shall?"

"Yes, on condition that I save you unnecessary risks."

"Oh what a fool I've been!" Marian exclaimed, with one of her expressive gestures.

"Mr. Vosburgh," said Merwyn, "there is one duty which I feel I ought to perform first of all.
Mrs. Ghegan, your old waitress, should be taken to her husband."

"What! Barney? What has happened to him?"

"I fear he is dead. I disguised myself as you see--"

"Yes, sensibly. No well-dressed man is safe on some streets."

"Certainly not where I've been. I determined to learn the character of the mob, and I have
mingled among them all the morning. I saw the invalid corps put to flight instantly, and the
fight with a handful of police that followed. I looked on, for to take part was to risk life
and means of knowledge uselessly. The savage, murderous spirit shown on every side also proved
that your household might be in danger while you were absent. The police fought bravely and
vainly.  They were overpowered as a matter of course, and yet the police will prove the city's
chief defence. When I saw Barney running and fighting heroically for his life, I couldn't remain
spectator any longer, but before I could reach him he was prostrate, senseless, and nearly
stripped. With my revolver and a little persuasion I secured his body, and took it to a hospital.
A surgeon thought he was dead. I don't know, but that his wife should be informed and go to
him seems only common humanity."

"Well, Merwyn, I don't know," said Mr. Vosburgh, dubiously; "we are in the midst of a great
battle, and when one is down--Well, the cause must be first, you know. Whether this is a part
of the rebellion or not, it will soon be utilized by the Confederate leaders. What I say of
Barney I would say of myself and mine,--all private considerations must give--"

"I understand," interrupted Merwyn, impatiently. "But in taking Mrs. Ghegan across town I could
see and learn as much as if alone, and she would even be a protection to me. In getting information
one will have to use every subterfuge. I think nothing will be lost by this act. From the hospital
I will go direct to police headquarters, and stipulate as to my service,--for I shall serve
in my own way,--and then, if there is no pressing duty, I will report to you again."

Mr. Vosburgh sprung up and wrung the young fellow's hand as he said: "We have done you great
wrong. I, too, beg your pardon. But more than all the city to me is my duty to the general
government. To a certain extent I must keep aloof from the actual scenes of violence, or I
fail my employers and risk vast interests. If consistently with your ideas of duty you can
aid me now, I shall be more grateful than if you saved my life. Information now may be vital
to the nation's safety. You may find me at police headquarters an hour or two hence."

"It is settled then, and events will shape future action;" and he was turning hastily away.

A hand fell upon his arm, and never had he looked upon a face in which shame and contrition
were so blended.

"What will be your future action towards me?" Marian asked, as she detained him. "Will you
have no mercy on the girl who was so weak as to be almost hysterical?"

"You have redeemed your weakness," he replied, coldly. "You are your old high-bred, courageous
self, and you will probably cease to think of me as a coward before the day is over. Good-afternoon;"
and in a moment he was gone.

"I have offended him beyond hope," she said, as she turned, drooping, to her father.

"Never imagine it, darling," her father replied, with a smile. "His lip quivered as you spoke,
and I have learned to read the faintest signs in a man. You have both been overwrought and
in no condition for calm, natural action. Mervvyn will relent. You lost your poise through
excitement, not cowardice, and he, young and all undisciplined, has witnessed scenes that might
appall a veteran. But now all must be courage and action. Since you will remain with me you
must be a soldier, and be armed like one. Come with me to my room, and I will give you a small
revolver. I am glad that you have amused yourself with the dangerous toy, and know how to use
it. Then you must help me plan a disguise which will almost deceive your eyes. Keeping busy,
my dear, will prove the best tonic for your nerves. Mammy Borden, you must go to your room
and stay there till we find a way of sending you to a place of safety. After you have disappeared
for a time I'll tell the other servant that you have gone away. I sent your son home before
I left the office, and he, no doubt, is keeping out of harm's way."

The old woman courtesied, but there was a dogged, hunted look in her eyes as she crept away,
muttering, "Dis is what Zeb call de 'lan' ob de free!'"

CHAPTER XLIV.

A WIFE'S EMBRACE.

"O PAPA," cried Marian, after reaching the library, "we let Mr. Merwyn go without a lunch,
and it's nearly two o'clock. Nor do I believe you have had a mouthful since breakfast, and
I've forgotten all about providing anything. Oh, how signally I have failed on the first day
of battle!"

"You are not the first soldier, by untold millions, who has done so; but you have not shown
the white feather yet."

"When I do that I shall expire from shame. You rummage for a disguise, and I'll be back soon."

She hastened to the kitchen, and at a glance saw that the Irish cook had fled, taking not a
little with her. The range fire was out, and the refrigerator and the store-closet had been
ravaged. She first barred and bolted all the doors, and then the best she could bring her father
was crackers and milk and some old Sherry wine; but she nearly dropped these when she saw a
strange man, as she supposed, emerge from his bedroom.

Mr. Vosburgh's laugh reassured her, and he said: "I fancy I shall pass among strangers, since
you don't know me. Nothing could be better than the milk and crackers. No wine. My head must
be clearer to-day than it ever was before. So the Irish Biddy has gone with her plunder? Good
riddance to her. She would have been a spy in the camp. I'll bring home food that won't require
cooking, and you'll have to learn to make coffee, for Merwyn and others will, no doubt, often
come half dead from fatigue. All we can do is to forage in such shops as are open, and you'll
have to take the office of commissary at once. You must also be my private secretary. As fast
as I write these despatches and letters copy them. I can eat and write at the same time. In
an hour I must go out."

"I won't play the fool again," said the girl, doggedly.

"Drink this glass of milk first, while I run down for more, and satisfy my mind as to the fastenings,
etc."

"But, papa--"

"Marian," he said, gravely, "you can stay with me only on one condition: you must obey orders."

"That is what Mr. Merwyn said. Oh what a credit I've been to my military friends!" and with
difficulty she drank the milk.

"You are a promising young recruit," was the smiling reply. "We'll promote you before the week's
out."

In five minutes he was back, cool, yet almost as quick as light in every movement.

The despatches she copied were unintelligible to Marian, but the one to whom they were addressed
had the key. The copies of the letters were placed in a secret drawer.

When their tasks were finished, Mr. Vosburgh looked up and down the street and was glad to
find it comparatively empty. The storm of passion was raging elsewhere.

He closed all the shutters of the house, giving it a deserted aspect, then said to his daughter.
"You must admit no one in my absence, and parley with no one who does not give the password,
'Gettysburg and Little Round Top.' If men should come who say these words, tell them to linger
near without attracting attention, and come again after I return. Admit Merwyn, of course,
for you know his voice. It is a terrible trial to leave you alone, but there seems to be no
prospect of trouble in this locality. At all events, I must do my duty, cost what it may. Be
vigilant, and do not worry unnecessarily if I am detained."

"I am bent on retrieving myself, papa; and I'd rather die than be so weak again."

"That's my brave girl. You won't die. After this venture, which I must make at once, I shall
be able to take greater precautions;" and with a fond look and kiss, he hastened away through
the basement entrance, Marian fastening it securely after him.

We must now follow Merwyn's fortunes for a time. Rapidly, yet vigilantly he made his way up
town and crossed Third Avenue. He soon observed that the spirit of lawlessness was increasing.
Columns of smoke were rising from various points, indicating burning buildings, and in Lexington
Avenue he witnessed the unblushing sack of beautiful homes, from which the inmates had been
driven in terror for their lives.

"It will be strange if Mr. Vosburgh's home escapes," he thought. "Some one must know enough
of his calling to bring upon him and his the vengeance of the mob. I shall do the best I can
for him and his daughter, but to-day has slain the last vestige of hope beyond that of compelling
her respect. Wholly off her guard, she showed her deep-rooted detestation, and she can never
disguise it again. Regret and mortification at her conduct, a wish to make amends and to show
gratitude for such aid as I may give her father, will probably lead her to be very gracious;
at the same time I shall ever know that in her heart is a repugnance which she cannot overcome.
A woman can never love a man towards whom she has entertained thoughts like hers;" and with
much bitter musings, added to his reckless impulses, he made his way to the region in which
Mrs. Ghegan had her rooms.

Finding a livery stable near he hired a hack, securing it by threats as well as money, and
was soon at the door of the tenement he sought.

Mrs. Ghegan showed her scared, yet pretty face in response to his knock.

"Ye's brought me bad news," she said, instantly, beginning to sob.

"Yes, Mrs. Ghegan; but if you love your husband you will show it now. I have come to take you
to him. He has been wounded."

"Is it Mr. Merwyn?"

"Yes; I've just come from Mr. Vosburgh, and he will do what he can for you when he has a chance.
They know about your trouble. Now make haste, for we've not a moment to lose in reaching the
hospital."

"The Lord knows I love Barney as me loife, an' that I'd go to him through fire and blood. Oi'll
kape ye no longer than to tie me bonnet on;" and this she was already doing with trembling fingers.

Locking the door, she took the key with her, and was soon in the hack. Merwyn mounted the box
with the driver, knowing that openness was the best safeguard against suspicions that might
soon prove fatal. At one point they were surrounded and stopped by the rioters, who demanded
explanations.

"Clear out, ye bloody divils!" cried Sally, who did not count timidity among her foibles; "wud
ye kape a woman from goin' to her husband, a-dyin' beloikes?"

"Oh, let us pass," said Merwyn, in a loud tone. "A cop knocked her husband on the head, and
we are taking her to him."

"Och! ye are roight, me mon. We'll let onybody pass who spakes in her swate brogue;" and the
crowd parted.

Reaching the hospital, Sally rushed into the office with the breathless demand, "Where's Barney?"

Merwyn recognized the surgeon he had met before, and said: "You know the man I brought a few
hours since. This is his wife."

The surgeon looked grave and hesitated.

"What have ye done wid him?" Sally almost screamed. "Are ye no better than the bloody villains
in the strates?"

"My good woman," began the surgeon, "you must be more composed and reasonable. We try to save
life when there is life--"

"Where is he?" shrieked the woman.

The surgeon, accustomed to similar scenes, nodded to an attendant, and said, gravely, "Show her."

Merwyn took the poor woman's hand to restrain as well as to reassure her, saying, with sympathies
deeply touched, "Mrs. Ghegan, remember you are not friendless, whatever happens."

"Quick! quick!" she said to her guide. "Och! what's a wurld uv frin's if I lose Barney? Poor
man! poor man! He once said I blew hot and could, but oi'd give him me loife's blood now."

To Merwyn's sorrow they were led to the dead-house, and there lay the object of their quest,
apparently lifeless, his battered face almost past recognition. But Sally knew him instantly,
and stared for a moment as if turned to stone; then, with a wild cry, she threw herself upon
him, moaning, sobbing, and straining his unconscious form to her breast.

Merwyn felt that it would be best to let her paroxysm of grief expend itself unrestrained;
but a bitter thought crossed his mind,--"I may be in as bad a plight as poor Barney before
the day closes, yet no one would grieve for me like that."

Suddenly Mrs. Ghegan became still. In her embrace her hand had rested over her husband's heart,
and had felt a faint pulsation. A moment later she sprung up and rushed back to the office.
Merwyn thought that she was partially demented, and could scarcely keep pace with her.

Bursting in at the door, she cried: "Och! ye bloody spalpanes, to put a loive man where ye
did! Come wid me, an' oi'll tache ye that I knows more than ye all."

"Please satisfy her," said Merwyn to the surgeon, who was inclined to ignore what he regarded
as the wild ravings of a grief-crazed woman.

"Well, well, if it will do any good; but we have too much to do to-day for those who have a
chance--"

"Come on, or oi'll drag ye there," the wife broke in.

"When I've satisfied you, my good woman, you must become quiet and civil. Other wives have
lost their husbands--"

But Sally was already out of hearing. Reaching the supposed corpse, the deeply excited woman
said, with eyes blazing through her tears, "Put yez hand on his heart."

The surgeon did so, and almost instantly the expression of his face changed, and he said sharply
to the attendant, "Bring a stretcher with bearers at once." Then to Sally: "You are right;
he is alive, but there was no such pulsation as this when he was brought here. Now be quiet
and cheer up, and we may help you save his life. You can stay and take care of him."

Merwyn again took the wife's trembling hand and said, earnestly: "Mrs. Ghegan, obey the surgeon's
orders exactly. Be quiet, gentle, and self-controlled, and Barney may outlive us all."

"Faix, Mr. Merwyn, now that oi've hope I'll be whist as a baby asleep. Ye knew me onst as a
light, giddy gurl, but oi'll watch over Barney wid such a slapeless eye as wud shame his own
mither."

And she kept her word. For days and nights her husband remained unconscious, wavering between
life and death. The faithful woman, as indifferent to the tumult and havoc in the city as if
it were in another land, sat beside him and furthered all efforts in a winning fight.

Merwyn saw him in a hospital ward, surrounded by skilful hands, before he took his leave.

"God bless ye!" Sally began. "If yez hadn't brought me--"

But, pressing her hand warmly, he did not wait to hear her grateful words.

CHAPTER XLV.

THE DECISIVE BATTLE.

MERWYN was now very anxious to reach police headquarters in Mulberry Street, for he felt that
the safety of the city, as well as all personal interests dear to him, depended upon adequate
and well-organized resistance.

The driver, having been promised a handsome reward to remain, still waited. Indeed, he had
gained the impression that Merwyn was in sympathy with the ruthless forces then in the ascendant,
and he felt safer in his company than if returning alone.

Mounting the box again, Merwyn directed the driver to make his way through the more open streets
to Broadway and 14th Street.

They had not gone far through the disturbed districts when four rough-looking men stopped them,
took possession of the hack, and insolently required that they should be driven to Union Square.
The last ugly-visaged personage to enter the vehicle paused a moment, drew a revolver, and
said, "An' ye don't 'bey orders, this little bull-dog will spake to ye next."

The Jehu looked with a pallid face at Merwyn, who said, carelessly: "It's all right. They are
going in my direction."

The quartet within soon began to entertain suspicions of Merwyn, and the one who had last spoken,
apparently the leader, thrust his head out of the window and shouted: "Shtop! Who the divil
is that chap on the box wid ye?"

"I'll answer for myself," said Merwyn, seeking to employ the vernacular as well as the appearance
of an American mechanic. "The driver don't know anything about me. A cop knocked a friend of
mine on the head this morning, and I've been taking his wife to him."

The driver now took his cue, and added, "Faix, and a nice, dacent little Irishwoman she was,
bedad."

"Then ye're wan wid us?" cried the leader of the gang.

"It looks mighty like it," was the laughing reply. "This would be a poor place for me to hang
out, if I was afraid of you or your friends."

"Yez may bet your loife on that. How coomes it ye're so hand-and-glove wid an Irishman, when
ye spake no brogue at all?"

"Thunder! man, do you think no one but Irishmen are going to have a fist in this scrimmage?
I'm as ready to fight as you are, and am only going down town to join my own gang. Why shouldn't
I have an Irishman for a friend, if he's a good fellow, I'd like to know?"

"Beloikes they'll be yez best frin's. All roight. Dhrive on and moind your eye, or the bull-dog
will bark."

They ordered a halt several times, while one and another went to a saloon for a drink. It was
fast becoming evident that, should there be any want of courage or recklessness, whiskey would
supply the lack.

Merwyn preserved nonchalant indifference, even when his disreputable companions were approached
by those with whom they were in league, and information and orders were exchanged which he
partially overheard. Although much was said in a jargon that he scarcely understood, he gathered
that nothing less was on foot than an attack on police headquarters, in the hope of crushing
at the start the power most feared. Therefore, while he maintained his mask, every sense was
on the alert.

At length they reached Union Square, and the occupants of the hack alighted. Two went east
and one west, while the leader said to Merwyn, who had also jumped down: "Take me to your gang.
We're afther needing ivery divil's son of 'im widin the next hour or so. It's a big game we're
playin' now, me lad, an' see that ye play square and thrue, or your swateheart'll miss ye the
noight."

"You'll have to have a bigger crowd on Broadway before you'll get our fellows out," Merwyn
replied. "We're not going to face the cops until there's enough on hand to give us a livin'
chance."

"There'll be plenty on hand--more'n ye ever seed in yer loife--before ye're an hour older.
So lead on, and shtop your palaver. I'm not quite sure on ye yet."

"You soon will be," replied Merwyn, with his reckless and misleading laugh. "My course is down
Broadway to Bleecker Street and then west.  I can show you as pretty a lot of fellows as you'll
want to see, and most of us are armed."

"All roight. Broadway suits me. I want to see if the coast is clear."

"So do I, and what the cops are about in these diggin's. The right thing to do is for all hands
to pitch right on to them in Mulberry Street, and then the game's in our own hands."

"If that's the lark we have on foot, can ye promise that yer gang'll join us?"

"Yes, sir, for we'd know that meant business."

"How many could ye muster?"

"I hardly know. We were a-growin' fast when I left."

"Well, lead on loively. Ivery minute now should give me a dozen men, an' we want to start the
blaze down this way. I tell ye it's a burning-up town."

"So I should guess from the smoke we see," said Merwyn, with his old laugh. "Jupiter! there
comes a squad of cops."

"Well, what do we care? We're two paceable, dacent citizens, a-strollin' down Broadway."

"Oh, I'm not afraid," was the careless reply. "I'm going to see this scrimmage out, and I like
the fun. Let's watch the cops cross the street, and see how they are armed."

As the little squad approached Broadway from a side-street, hastening to headquarters, the
Hibernian firebrand and his supposed ally stood on the curbstone, A moment later Merwyn struck
his companion such a powerful blow on the temple that he fell in the street, almost in front
of the officers of the law. The young fellow then sprung upon the stunned and helpless man,
and took away his weapons, at the same time, crying: "Secure him. He's a leader of the mob."

"Yes, and you too, my hard hitter," said the sergeant in command.

"I'll go quietly enough, so long as you take him with me. Be quick about it, too, for I have
news that should be known at headquarters as soon as possible."

The police now supposed that they recognized one of a band of detectives, everywhere busy about
the city in all kinds of disguises,--men of wonderful nerve, who rendered the authorities very
important services, and often captured the most dangerous of the ruffianly leaders.

The fellow in question was hustled to his feet, having discovered Merwyn's gang sooner than
he desired. The squad pushed through the fast-gathering and bewildered crowd, and soon reached
headquarters. The young fellow told his story in the presence of Mr. Vosburgh, who evidently
had credentials which secured for him absolute confidence on the part of the authorities.

Merwyn soon learned to recognize in his interlocutor, the superintendent of the metropolitan
police, a man to whose active brain, iron will, and indomitable courage, the city chiefly owed
its deliverance,--Thomas C. Acton.

Confirmation of the sinister tidings was already coming in fast. The brutal mob that had sacked
and burned the Colored Orphan Asylum was moving southward, growing with accessions from different
quarters, like a turbulent torrent. Its destination was well understood, and Acton knew that
the crisis had come thus early. He frequently conferred with Chief Clerk Seth C. Hawley, upon
whom, next to himself, rested the heaviest burdens of those terrific days.

Merwyn offered his services on the force, stipulating, however, that he might be in a measure
his own master, since he had other duties to perform, at the same time promising to do his
share of the fighting.

Mr. Vosburgh drew Acton to one side, and made a few whispered explanations. Merwyn's request
was granted at once, Acton adding, "There will be a general call in the morning papers for
the enrolment of citizens as policemen."

The moments were crowded with preparations, counsels, and decisions. The telegraph wires, concentring
there from all parts of the city, were constantly ticking off direful intelligence; but the
most threatening fact was the movement down Broadway of unknown thousands, maddened by liquor,
and confident from their unchecked excesses during the day. They knew that they had only to
destroy the handful of men at police headquarters and the city was theirs to plunder and destroy
with hyena-like savagery.

Acton, now cognizant of the worst, went to the police commissioners' room and said: "Gentlemen,
the crisis has come. A battle must be fought now, and won, too, or all is lost."

None doubted the truth of his word; but who should lead the small force at hand? Inspector
Carpenter's name was suggested, for he was known to be a man of great resolution and courage,
and leadership naturally fell to him as one of the oldest and most experienced members of the
force. Acton instructed him not only that a battle must be fought immediately, but also that
it MUST be successful.

Carpenter listened quietly, comprehending both the peril and the necessity; then after a moment's
hesitation he rose to his full height, and with an impressive gesture and a terrible oath said,
"I will go, and I'll win that fight, or Daniel Carpenter will never come back a live man."

He instantly summoned his insignificant force, and the order, "Fall in, men," resounded through
the street.

Merwyn, with a policeman's coat buttoned over his blouse, avowed his purpose of going with
them; and his exploit of the afternoon, witnessed and bruited by members of the force, made
his presence welcome.

It was now between five and six in the evening. The air was hot and sultry, and in the west
lowered heavy clouds, from which the thunder muttered. Emblematic they seemed to such as heeded
them in the intense excitement.

Few in the great city at that hour were so deeply stirred as Merwyn. The tremendous excitements
of the day, to which his experience at Mr. Vosburgh's residence had chiefly contributed, were
cumulative in their effect. Now he had reached the goal of his hope, and had obtained an opportunity,
far beyond his wildest dreams, to redeem his character from the imputation of cowardice. He
was part of the little force which might justly be regarded as a "forlorn hope." The fate of
the city depended upon its desperate valor, and no one knew this better than he, who, from
early morning, had witnessed the tiger-spirit of the mob. If the thousands, every minute approaching
nearer, should annihilate the handful of men who alone were present to cope with them, that
very night the city would be at the mercy of the infuriated rioters, and not a home would be
secure from outrage.

The column of police was formed scarcely two hundred strong. Merwyn, as a new recruit, was
placed in its rear, a position that he did not mean to keep when the fight should begin. Like
the others, he was armed with a locust-club, but he had two revolvers on his person, and these
he knew how to use with fatal precision. From an open window Superintendent Acton shouted,
"Inspector Carpenter, my orders are, Make no arrests, bring no prisoners, but kill--kill every,
time."

It was to be a life-and-death struggle. The mob would have no mercy: the officers of the law
were commanded to show none.

As Carpenter went forward to the head of his column, his face as dark with his sanguinary puipose
as the lowering west, Merwyn saw that Mr. Vosburgh, quiet and observant, was present.

The government officer, with his trained instincts, knew just where to be, in order to obtain
the most vital information. He now joined Merwyn, and was struck by his extreme pallor, a characteristic
of the young fellow under extreme emotion.

"Mr. Merwyn," he said, hastily, "you have done enough for two to-day, You need rest. This is
going to be a desperate encounter."

"Forward!" shouted Carpenter.

A proud smile lighted up Merwyn's features, as he said: "Good-by. Thank you for such faith
as you have had in me;" and he moved off with the others.

Mr. Vosburgh muttered, "I shall see this fight, and I shall solve that embodied mystery whom
we have thought a coward;" and he followed so near as to keep Merwyn under his eye.

A black, sulphurous cloud was rising in the west. This little dark blue column approaching
from the east, marching down Bleecker Street, was insignificant in comparison, yet it was infinitely
the more dangerous, and charged with forces that would scatter death and wounds such as the
city had never witnessed.

No words were spoken by the resolute men. The stony pavement echoed their measured, heavy tread.
Turning into Broadway they saw the enemy but a block and a half away, a howling mob, stretching
northward as far as the eye could reach. It was sweeping the thoroughfare, thousands in line.
Pedestrians, stages, vehicles of all kinds, were vanishing down side-streets. Pallid shopkeepers
were closing their stores as sailors take in sail before a cyclone.

Carpenter halted his command, and sent small detachments up parallel side-streets, that they
might come around and fall upon the flanks of the mob.

As these men were moving off on the double-quick, Merwyn left his squad and said to Carpenter:
"I am a citizen, and I stipulated that I should fight as I chose. I choose to fight with you."

"Well, well, so long as you fight," was the hasty answer. "You shall have plenty of it, if
you keep near me." Then he added, sternly: "Mark you, young fellow, if you show the white feather
I'll knock you over myself. Those devils yonder must be taught that the one thing this force
can't do is run."

"Brain me if I do not do my whole duty," was the firm reply; and he took his place at the right
of the front rank.

A moment later he was startled by Mr. Vosburgh, who seized his hand and said, earnestly: "Merwyn,
no man ever did a braver thing than you are doing now. I can't forgive myself that I wronged
you in my thoughts."

"You had reason. I'm doing no better than these other men, and I have a thousand-fold their
motive." Then he added, gravely, "I do not think you ought to be here and your daughter alone."

"I know my duty," was the quiet reply; "and there are those who must be informed of the issue
of this fight as soon as it is over. Once more, farewell, my brave friend;" and he disappeared.

Carpenter was holding his force until his flanking detachments should reach their co-operative
points. When the mob saw the police, it advanced more slowly, as if it, too, instinctively
recognized that the supreme crisis was near. In the van of the dense mass a large board was
borne aloft, inscribed with the words, "No Draft!" and beside it, in mocking irony, floated
the stars and stripes.

The hesitation of the rioters was but brief. They mistook the inaction of the few policemen
opposed to them for timidity, and the immense masses behind pushed them forward. Therefore,
with a new impetus, the howling, yelling throng approached, and Merwyn could distinguish the
features of the liquor-inflamed, maddened faces that were already becoming familiar to him.
In the sultry July evening the greater part of the rioters were in their shirt-sleeves, and
they were armed with every description of weapon, iron bars, clubs, pitchforks, barrel-staves,
and not a few with guns and pistols.

Carpenter stood out before his men, watching the approach of his victims with an expression
which only the terrible excitement of battle can produce. His men, behind him, were like statues.
Suddenly his stentorian command rang out,--

"BY THE RIGHT FLANK, COMPANY FRONT! DOUBLE-QUICK! CHARGE!"

As if the lever of a powerful engine had been pressed, all clubs were raised aloft, and with
swift, even tread the trained, powerful men rushed after their leader, who kept several paces
ahead.

When such a disciplined force, with such a leader, have resolved to fight till they die, their
power is not to be estimated by numbers. They smote the astonished van of the mob like a thunderbolt,
Carpenter leading by several steps, his face aflame with his desperate resolve. He dealt the
first blow, sending down, bleeding and senseless, a huge ruffian who was rushing upon him with
a club.  A second later the impetuous officer was in the midst of the mob, giving deadly blows
right and left.

His men closed up with him instantly, Merwyn being among the first to reach his side, and for
a few moments the thud of clubs on human skulls was heard above every other sound. Mr. Vosburgh,
keeping a little to the rear on the sidewalk, watched Merwyn, who held his attention almost
equally with the general issues of this decisive battle. The youth was dealing blows like an
athlete, and keeping pace with the boldest. The windows of the buildings on Broadway were now
crowded by thousands witnessing the conflict, while Mr. Vosburgh, following closely, heard
the ominous "sing" of more than one bullet. The man who had come that day to the protection
of his home and child should not be left to the mercy of strangers, should he fall. To his
surprise he soon saw that Merwyn had shifted his club to his left hand, and that he was fighting
with a revolver. He watched the young fellow with renewed interest, and observed that his aim
was as deliberate as it was quick, and that often when he fired some prominent figure in the
mob dropped.

"By all the powers! if he is not coolly shooting the leaders, and picking out his man every
time!" ejaculated the astonished officer.

The police made a clean sweep of the street, and only prostrate forms were left in their rear.
Therefore Mr. Vosburgh could almost keep pace with Merwyn.

The rioters soon became appalled at their punishment. Like a dark blue wave, with bloody clubs
forming a crimson crest, that unfaltering rank of men steadily advanced and ingulfed them.
All within reach went down. Those of the police who were wounded still fought on, or, if disabled,
the ranks closed up, and there was no cessation in the fatal hail of blows. The rioters in
front would have given way, had not the thousands in their rear pressed them forward to their fate.

The judicious Carpenter had provided for this feature of the strife, for now his detachments
were smiting both flanks of the human monster with the same terrific vengeance dealt upon its
head. The undisciplined herd fought desperately for a time, then gave way to panic and the
wild effort to escape. Long since a policeman had seized the national flag, and bore it triumphantly
with his left hand while he fought with his right. The confusion and uproar were beyond description.
The rioters were yelling their conflicting views as to what ought to be done, while others
were shouting to those in their rear to cease crowding forward. The pressure down Broadway
now came from a desire to escape the police. During the time I was with the Germans they treated me with every
consideration.

Food was scarce, owing to the fact that the roads were so well shelled
by our artillery that their transport could not come up; but they
shared their food with me.

They also dressed my wound with the greatest care, and in every way made me
as comfortable as possible. Being able to speak a little German, I
talked to the other wounded, and found that their papers also published
dreadful tales of our treatment of prisoners, which I am glad to say
I was able to refute.

I am, Sir, yours faithfully, A BRITISH OFFICER.

December 27.

I would especially call the attention of fair-minded men to the last
sentences.

Here is a letter written by Second-Lieut. F. Phillips Pearce (aged 18) of the 2nd Essex Regiment,
from Crefeld on October 27, and printed in the Times of November 19, 1914:

We are treated very well indeed here. We have good beds and fires
in the rooms, three good meals a day, and a French soldier for a
servant, and this morning I had a splendid hot bath.

We have roll call twice a day, at 8 a.m. and 9.45 p.m., and lights out at 10.45,
and we have a large courtyard to walk about in. We have a canteen here
where we can buy clothes and anything we want. Prison fare is very good—new
rolls and coffee and fresh butter. Not bad!

I had a very decent guard when I was coming up on the train; he got
me food, and when one man tried to get in to attack me he threw him off the
train. I am afraid I am out of the firing line until the war ends
(worse luck).

I am in no danger of being shot unless I try to bolt, which I shan’t do. I shot the man
who was carrying their colours, and he wanted to have me shot, but
luckily nobody seemed to agree with him.

The next time I saw him he had been bandaged up—he was shot through the
shoulder—and he dashed up and shook me by the hand and shouted, “Mein
Freund, mein Freund.”

On November 25 other letters appeared in the
Times.

One was from a cavalry subaltern
in a German fortress:

You ask about money; they provide lights and firing and all the men’s food. The officers get 16s.
a week and buy their own. Quite sufficient, as it is cheap. I have learnt
German fairly quickly and do interpreter now in the shop for the men, though,
I am afraid, tant mal que bien. One of the officials here used to be
a professor, and is very kind trying to teach us. Thanks for the warm underclothes,
and most awfully for the footballs. We have quite good matches....
It is better not to try to send any public news of any kind from England;
people having been stupid trying to smuggle letters in cakes and things,
and it only makes trouble for everyone.

A Captain writes:

For dinner at 1 p.m. we are given soup, meat and vegetables.... Supper
takes place at 7 o’clock and consists of tea, sausages or meat and potatoes....
We receive £5 a month as pay, of which 1s. 6d. is deducted for food
each day. We have a canteen here at which we can buy everything we want,
... so there is no need to send me anything at all, except perhaps
those small 7d. editions of novels.

An English lady wrote early in 1915 from Munich:

I must tell you
I had permission to visit a wounded English officer, a cousin, and
I think it would reassure many people at home to know how warmly he
speaks of the great kindness that has been shown him now for five
months, as well as the skill and attention of the doctors.—(Times,
March 17, 1915.)

Here, too, is a letter from Lieut.-Observer J. E. P.
Harvey, an officer of the Bedfordshire Yeomanry, and attached to the
Royal Flying Corps:

I met one of the pilots of the German machines
that had attacked us.

He could speak English well and we shook hands after a most thrilling fight. I had brought down his machine
with my machine-gun, and he had to land quite close to where I landed.
He had a bullet through his radiator and petrol tank, but neither
he nor his observer was touched.

I met two German officers that knew several people that I knew, and
they were most awfully kind to me.

They gave me a very good dinner of champagne and oysters, etc., and I was treated like an honoured
guest. I then came by train the next day to Mainz, where I was confined in a room by myself for two
days. I have now been moved into a general room with eight other English
officers, where we sleep and eat. We are treated very well, and play
hockey and tennis in the prison yard.—(News of the World, February
27, 1916.)

Miss Colenso gives the following account, which appeared in the Daily
News of June 28, 1918:

A minister friend of mine told me the story
of a young Scottish boy of his acquaintance, now a military prisoner
in Germany—I forget for the moment in which camp.

This
boy received a letter from home one day telling of his mother’s serious illness and the doctor’s
verdict that she could only live a few weeks.

The German Commandant, finding the boy in great distress, asked him what was the matter, and on learning
the cause of his grief, said: “Would you like to go home to your
mother?” The boy sprang up, exclaiming indignantly, “How can you mock
me when you know it is impossible?” “But you shall go, my boy,” said
the commandant. “I will pay your return fare on condition that you
give me your word of honour to come back here.” The boy went home
to Scotland and remained by his mother’s side for about three weeks
till her death, when, true to his word, he returned to Germany.

The writer of “Under the Clock” considers that “well-attested” stories
of this kind should be given publicity.

It is even more necessary to examine the “attestation” of the other kinds of stories, for all the bias is against
the enemy, and demand is apt to create supply.

MERSEBURG, DŒBERITZ.

I pass on now to a report made by a United States Official. The American
Consul writes from Leipzig under date of November 16, 1914: “On
Saturday afternoon, the 14th instant, I visited the military concentration
camp near Merseburg, where some 10,000 prisoners of war are interned.
The object of my visit was to investigate the claim of a French prisoner
that he is an American subject. The result of my observations regarding
the welfare and humane treatment of the prisoners at large was a
surprise to me.... Separated by nationality, these prisoners are housed
in wooden buildings, well built, ventilated and heated.... They sleep
upon straw mattresses in well-warmed quarters, and, as far as I could
judge, are as well or better housed than labourers upon public works
in the United States.

The prisoners are fed three times a day. Breakfast consists of coffee and bread. Dinner consists of vegetable
and meat, soup and bread, and for supper they are given bread and
coffee.

I was informed that many of the prisoners have some money, and that they
are allowed to buy whatever else they may wish to eat.

If I may judge from the mounds of empty beer bottles at hand, there
is evidence in support of this statement. The prisoners appeared
to be in good health and cheerful, many of them engaging in games
and other pastimes.”

The diet described must be frightfully monotonous. Feeding has throughout
been one of the German difficulties. “Germany claims to hold 433,000 prisoners
of war,” wrote an anonymous American journalist (probably in November,
1914); “the housing and feeding of so great a number must be a tremendous
strain upon resources drained by the necessities of war.” The numbers
must now exceed two million.

The Press article referred to [Misc. No. 7 (1915)] is severe on the misery of camp life, and
the verminousness of the men (they were of mixed nationality) in the
camp at Döberitz which he visited. (See, however, the further official
reports quoted below at p. 9). But the writer does not confine his
condemnation to one side. “One hears of battles in which no quarter
is granted.

There are stories of one side or the other refusing an armistice to
permit the other to gather its wounded. Each side is desperately determined
to win, and neither is counting the cost. So men must rust in prison
camps until the struggle is over.” The monotony in this case seems
to have been varied by fights between the prisoners of different nationality,
each set considering that the others had not done their part in the
war.

We need not be contemptuous about that. The monotony of the prisoners’
life must tend to produce the maximum degree of mutual friction.

There is absolutely no privacy for the prisoner of war. To be forced
to remain, day and night, for months and years in idleness, with a
crowd of others, not of one’s own choice is, I believe, one of the
psychological factors which make internment (especially to many civilians)
decidedly worse than imprisonment in a criminal prison.

CORRESPONDENCE AND PACKAGES.

My next document illustrates the fact that each side makes similar
complaints about the other.

Telegram received by American Embassy, London, December 23, 1914, 22nd from
Berlin Embassy:

“Foreign Office reports receiving many complaints that money and packages
sent German military and civilian prisoners in enemy countries from
Germany do not reach addresses.

Please secure information for Department to forward German Foreign Office
whether money and other postal matter will be delivered to such prisoners promptly
and intact.—BRYAN, Washington.”

There is no doubt that many letters and parcels have not reached German prisoners
in England. Lord Robert Cecil has fully allowed this. (Times report.
March 11, 1915.) In spite of this, I have no doubt that the British
authorities have done their best to expedite delivery. I would suggest
that this is probably the case on the other side, too. We shall indeed later
come upon some definite statements in support of this view. One frequent
cause of the non-arrival of parcels in Germany has been convincingly
described by Mr. Ian Malcolm, M.P. (Daily Mail, November 8, 1916,
and Reprint):

I did not approach this subject quite “new to the game.”
I had already visited general post offices in England, Switzerland
and elsewhere, and had seen thousands, literally thousands, of food
parcels intended for our prisoners of war in Germany falling to bits
and incapable of being forwarded for want of skilled packing.

The
sight was enough to make angels weep. To think that so much self-sacrifice
had been exercised in humble homes to save up bits of dripping, crusts
of bread, broken cigarettes, and what not, in order that these should
reach son or brother or sweetheart in Germany, yet packed so badly
albeit by loving hands, that in the first rough and tumble of the
post the paper burst, the string came undone, and the contents of
a dozen parcels fell in an inextricable jumble upon the floor.

There will unfortunately, too, be those in every land who will take opportunities
for mean thefts. We have all had experience of that during this
war, and the following cutting from the Daily News of October 5, 1915,
may be given in illustration:

In a letter of thanks to the secretary of the committee of the Elswick
and Scotswood workmen, formed for the purpose of sending comforts
to the troops, Sir Ian Hamilton says:

I am extremely touched by the
extraordinary generosity and kindness of the Elswick and Scotswood
workmen.

I will take great care to let our soldiers know to whom they are
indebted for this most handsome contribution.

Pray
heaven the parcels will escape thieves and scoundrels who waylaid some of the gifts, and will arrive in good
condition.

If there are, alas, not a few men who will steal from their comrades, there
are not likely to be fewer who will steal from their enemies.

Speaking generally, however, the delivery of parcels on both sides soon
became commendably regular.

The care shown on the German side is warmly praised by Captain Gilbert Nobbs, who remained quite able to appreciate
good deeds even after enduring terrible hardships and hearing worse stories
from others. The bad deeds of war, soldiers are able to judge better than
civilians. In his book “Englishman, Kamerad,” Captain Nobbs writes:

I was very much impressed with the fair and systematic handling of our parcels,
letters and money; even letters and postcards which arrived for me
after I had been sent back to England, were re-addressed and sent back. A remittance
of five pounds which arrived for me after I had left was even returned
to me in England, instead of being applied to the pressing need of
the German War Loan.—(Daily News, January 25, 1918.)

An acquaintance
of my own, a lecturer in a technical school, spoke to me to the same
effect.

He told me, as an illustration, of a parcel sent to him which had become
quite shattered in transit (p.p. 7).

The Germans transferred the contents to a sack, and, as he said, the temptation to pilfer the sorely-needed
foodstuffs must have been great. My informant also spoke of the very thorough inoculation against
disease.

ALTDAMM.

On December 31, 1914, Mr. Damm reported to Mr. Gerard on the Camp at Altdamm near Stettin. The general
arrangement, he remarks, is the same as that of the camp at Stargard on which he had reported previously.

“It appears to me that every effort is being made to treat the prisoners
of war as humanely as possible in the two camps I visited.

Dry and warm shelter is provided, the food is simple and perhaps monotonous,
but of good material and well prepared, sanitary arrangements are good,
and the health of the men is carefully looked after.”

RUMOURS V. INSPECTION.

But the general inspection of all camps had not yet been agreed to by
the German Government, and on February 23, 1915, Sir Edward Grey
wrote to Mr. Page (the American Ambassador in London) complaining
that no definite replies to his questions were forthcoming.

“His Majesty’s Government,” he continues, “have only unofficial information
and rumours on the subject to guide them, which they trust do not
accurately represent the facts.” The “unofficial information and rumours”
had, however, attained wide publicity, and obtained still more later.

The German authorities agreed on March 17, 1915, to general inspection of
detention camps and consideration of complaints. The reports now to be cited
were made after this date. [Misc. 11 (1915)].

I propose to give examples of almost all the earlier reports, for
it was in the earlier stages of the war that there was most difficulty
everywhere in providing accommodation for prisoners.

We ought
not to forget that the earliest reports on our own camps which the British
Government have published begin with February, 1916.[2]

DŒBERITZ.

On March 31 Mr. Jackson reported on the camp at Döberitz, a large
camp with between three and four thousand British prisoners. “So far
as I could ascertain, British soldiers are called upon to do only their
share in fatigue work.... So far as I could ascertain, after inquiry
of a number of men, nothing was known as to the stopping of either
incoming or outgoing correspondence.... The camp at Döberitz is in
a healthy location, and the barracks are new and of a permanent character....
They are at least as good as those used by the Germans at present
in the same neighbourhood.

As was to be expected a number of men had individual grievances,
but there were no general complaints, except with regard to the German
character of the food—and those were the exact counterparts of complaints
made to me by German prisoners in England.” I have italicised the
last clause as it will surely, to a fair-minded man, seem a somewhat
important one.

Mr. Lithgow Osborne visited the camp at the same time. He says:

Until two weeks ago the Russians and English were, in cases, housed
together—a source of complaint to the latter, more especially on
account of vermin.

The races have now been separated. The men all stated that they had the two blankets and the other requisites
provided in the German rules, and I heard but one complaint about overcrowding. Most of the English
and French receive clothes from home. All the prisoners who do not,
are furnished from the camp supply; the men stated that this was
carried out according to the rules.

No complaints whatever were made regarding the Commandant, the non-commissioned
officers, or the general government of the camp. The food was the source
of the few real complaints that could be heard, although at least
half of the men spoken to admitted that it was quite as good as could
possibly be expected.

The impression of the whole was excellent, and one received the idea that
everything that could reasonably be expected was done for the men by
the authorities in charge.

THREE POOR CAMPS.

Mr. Jackson’s reports on Burg bei Magdeburg, Magdeburg and Halle a/d Saale are the
most unfavourable. They were all small officers’ camps, Burg containing
75, Magdeburg 30, Halle 50 British officers.

There
were a few orderlies at each camp.

The chief points are inadequate ventilation, inadequate service for officers
and, in the first two, the fact that living rooms were used for all
purposes, there being no special mess or recreation rooms.

There seemed, however, to be no discrimination
against the British.

GŒTTINGEN.

Mr. Page himself reports on Göttingen, where there were about 6,000 prisoners.
“The Camp Commandant, Colonel Bogen, has done everything possible
to make this a model camp, and he has accomplished a great work. The
only complaint is as to the food, the quantity of which, of course,
is not under the control of the Commandant, as he is limited to an
expenditure of only 60 pfennigs (about 7d.) per day per man.

“Everything was in the most beautiful order. There was a very fine steam
laundry and drying room, bath rooms, with hot and cold showers, and the
closets, etc., are in a very good condition and scientifically built.

There is running water and electricity in the camp. A French barrister of Arras, named Léon Paillet, who
was working with the French Red Cross and who, for some reason or
other, has been made a prisoner, has done marvellous work in organising
libraries, etc.

“I am pleased to say that the professors and pastors
in Göttingen have, from the first, taken an interest in this camp,
and Professor Stange has done much in helping the lot of the prisoners.

The Y.M.C.A. building, erected through the efforts of Mr. A. C. Harte,
who for a number of years has been working with the Y.M.C.A. in India,
will be a great help to the men in the camp.

“At the opening ceremonies there were speeches by Colonel Bogen, Mr. Harte,
and Professor Stange, and then each speech was delivered in English
and French by prisoners. These were followed by short speeches by French,
English, and Belgian prisoners. Then came a concert by the camp orchestra
and the camp singing society, followed by songs and recitations by
various prisoners.”

Dr. Ohnesorg reported further on April 22.

At that time there were 6,577 prisoners, of whom 1,586 were British. He warmly commends the steam laundry, the steam
disinfecting plant, and the hospital. “A spirit of contentment pervaded
the camp.

The British prisoners were well clothed. I tasted the evening meal,
consisting of a vegetable soup, which was very palatable and, I should say,
nourishing.... The citizens of Göttingen have taken a great interest in
the camp, and some of them, notably Professor Stange, of the University,
have given a great deal of their time to the welfare of prisoners and
the formation of classes for study amongst them.”

GERMAN HELP FOR
PRISONERS.

The interest taken by prominent Germans in the welfare of prisoners
of war is little recognised in this country.

The Berlin Committee
(of which more will be said later) has received considerable support.
At the end of June, 1916, a meeting in support of its work was held
at the house of Prince Lichnowsky, former Ambassador in London, who
returned specially from the front to preside. The Bishop of Winchester,
writing in the Times, tells us that many notable men and women were
present, and that at the meeting a collection of 8,000 marks (about
£400) was made.

COLOGNE.

Mr. Michelson visited in April, 1915, the three Cologne hospitals
in which wounded British prisoners are lying.

He reports as follows:

These institutions are so typical of large, modern, well ordered hospitals
that little need be said of their employment or management.

They
are provided with all the machinery and paraphernalia usual to surgical
work on a large scale, contain all standard and necessary conveniences
and fittings, afford to patients a maximum of protection in the matter
of sanitation, quiet and relief from preventable irritation, and are
conducted in a thoroughly scientific, professional and humane way.

The names of the 49 wounded British prisoners are hereunto annexed.
I personally spoke to every one of these men, and with many of them
I conversed privately and without being overheard. With but one exception
no English-speaking British prisoner had any complaint to make, and
a number of the British prisoners eagerly expressed to me their appreciation
for the care and attention given them.

The physical condition of
the Indians is particularly good. Only 21 deaths have occurred among
the 1,000 wounded cared for in hospital No. VI. since the war began,
and the death rate in the other two hospitals is correspondingly low.
The physicians in charge consider the rate to be somewhat remarkable
in view of the many grave injuries treated.

In closing I may say
that there is no discrimination or segregation among the patients
and that certain French patients with whom I spoke expressed, likewise,
their appreciation for the care and attention given them.

In the light of that lurid day much had been revealed to her, and before her revery ceased
she understood her long months of irritation and anger at Merwyn's course; she saw why she
had not dismissed him from her thoughts with contemptuous indifference and why she had ingeniously
wrought the MacIan theory of constitutional timidity. When had she given so much thought to
a man whom she had disliked? Even in her disapproval of him, even when her soldier friends
appeared at their best and she was contrasting him with them to his fatal disadvantage as she
believed, thoughts of him would pursue her constantly. Now that he had shown himself the peer
of each and all in manhood and courage, it seemed as if feelings, long held in check, were
released and were sweeping irresistibly towards one conclusion. Merwyn was more to her than
any other man in the world. He had fulfilled her ideal, and was all the more attractive because
he was capable of such deep, strong passion, and yet could be so resolute and cool.

"But how can I ever undeceive him?" was her most perplexing thought. "I cannot make advances.
Well, well, the future must disentangle itself."

Now that she was beginning to understand herself, every instinct of her being led towards reserve.
In a misunderstanding with her soldier friends she could easily and frankly effect a reconciliation,
but she must be dumb with Merwyn, and distant in manner, to the degree that she was self-conscious.

Suddenly she became aware that it was growing late, and that her father had not returned, and
for the next hour she suffered terribly from anxiety, as did many women in those days of strange
vicissitudes.

At last, a little before midnight, he came, looking stern and anxious. "I will soon explain,"
he said to her. "Take this woman to her room." Then, to his aroused and sleepy agents: "You
have had some rest and respite. Go to the nearest hotel and take a little more, but be up with
the dawn and do your best, for to-morrow promises to be worse than to-day."

With a few further instructions he dismissed them.

Upon reaching the library he said to his daughter: "I've been at a conference in which the
police, military, and state authorities took part, and things look gloomy. I have also sent
further despatches.  My dear child, I wish you were with your mother, but I'm too weary to
think any more to-night."

"Papa, the question of my remaining has been settled. Now rest. Mr.  Merwyn came and brought
good news."

"Yes, I know all about it. Why did he not stay?"

"He naturally wished to return and look after his own home."

"True enough. I hope he found it unharmed. He has proved himself a grand, brave fellow to-day,
and I only wish it was my privilege to fight at his side. It would be far easier than to carry
my burden."

"Not another perplexing thought to-night, papa."

"Well, Marian, I must have some sleep, to be equal to to-morrow. You must obey orders and sleep
also. I shall not take off my clothes, and shall be ready for any emergency; and do you also
sleep in your wrapper."

He kissed her fondly, but with heavy eyes.

CHAPTER XLVII.

A FAIR FRIEND AND FOUL FOES.

THE reader has already discovered that I have not attempted anything approaching a detailed
history of the dreadful days of the riot. I merely hope to give a somewhat correct impression
of the hopes, fears, and passions which swayed men's minds and controlled or directed their
action. Many of the scenes are too horrible to be described, and much else relating to the
deeds and policy of recognized leaders belongs to the sober page of history. The city was in
awful peril, and its destruction would have crippled the general government beyond all calculation.
Unchecked lawlessness in New York would soon have spread to other centres. That cool, impartial
historian, the Comte de Paris, recognized the danger in his words: "Turbulent leaders were
present in the large cities of the East, which contained all the elements for a terrible insurrection.
This insurrection was expected to break out in New York, despite Lee's defeat: one may judge
what it might have been had Lee achieved a victory."

With the best intentions the administration had committed many grave errors,--none more so,
perhaps, than that of ordering the draft to be inaugurated at a time when the city was stripped
of its militia.

Now, however, it only remained for the police and a few hundreds of the military to cope with
the result of that error,--a reckless mob of unnumbered thousands, governed by the instinct
to plunder and destroy.

When the sun dawned in unclouded splendor on the morning of the 14th of July, a superficial
observer, passing through the greater part of the city, would not have dreamed that it could
become a battle-ground, a scene of unnumbered and untold outrages, during the day. It was hard
for multitudes of citizens, acquainted with what had already taken place, to believe in the
continuance of such lawlessness. In large districts there was an effort to carry on business
as usual. In the early hours vehicles of every kind rattled over the stony pavement, and when
at last Merwyn awoke, the sounds that came through his open windows were so natural that the
events of the preceding day seemed but a distorted dream. The stern realities of the past and
the future soon confronted him, however, and he rang and ordered breakfast at once.

Hastily disguising himself as he had done before, he again summoned his faithful servant. This
man's vigilance had enabled him to admit his master instantly the night before. Beyond the
assurance that all was well and safe Merwyn had not then listened to a word, yielding to the
imperative craving for sleep and rest. These, with youth and the vigor of a strong, unvitiated
constitution, had restored him wonderfully, and he was eager to enter on the perils and duties
of the new day. His valet and man-of-all-work told him that he had been at pains to give the
impression that the family was away and the house partially dismantled.

"It wouldn't pay ye," he had said to a band of plunderers, "to bother with the loikes of this
house when there's plenty all furnished."

With injunctions to maintain his vigilance and not to be surprised if Merwyn's absence was
prolonged, the young man hastened away, paving no heed to entreaties to remain and avoid risks.

It was still early, but the uneasy city was waking, and the streets were filling with all descriptions
of people. Thousands were escaping to the country; thousands more were standing in their doors
or moving about, seeking to satisfy their curiosity; while in the disaffected districts on
the east and the west side the hosts of the mob were swarming forth for the renewal of the
conflict, now inspired chiefly by the hope of plunder. Disquiet, anxiety, fear, anger, and
recklessness characterized different faces, according to the nature of their possessors; but
as a rule even the most desperate of the rioters were singularly quiet except when under the
dominion of some immediate and exciting influence.

In order to save time, Merwyn had again hired a hack, and, seated with the driver, he proceeded
rapidly, first towards the East River, and then, on another street, towards the Hudson. His
eyes, already experienced, saw on every side the promise of another bloody day. He was stopped
and threatened several times, for the rioters were growing suspicious, fully aware that detectives
were among them, but he always succeeded in giving some plausible excuse. At last, returning
from the west side, the driver refused to carry him any longer, and gave evidence of sympathy
with the mob.

Merwyn quietly showed him the butt of a revolver, and said, "You will drive till I dismiss you."

The man yielded sullenly, and Merwyn alighted near Mr. Vosburgh's residence, saying to his
Jehu, "Your course lies there," pointing east,--and he rapidly turned a corner.

As Merwyn had surmised, the man wheeled his horses with the purpose of following and learning
his destination. Observing this eager quest he sprung out upon him from a doorway and said,
"If you try that again I'll shoot you as I would a dog." The fellow now took counsel of discretion.

Going round the block to make sure he was not observed, Merwyn reached the residence of Mr.
Vosburgh just as that gentleman was rising from his breakfast, and received a cordial welcome.

"Why, Merwyn," he exclaimed, "you look as fresh as a June daisy this morning."

The young fellow had merely bowed to Marian, and now said, "I cannot wonder at your surprise,
remembering the condition in which I presented myself last night."

"Condition? I do not understand."

Marian laughed, as she said: "Papa came in about midnight in scarcely better plight. In brief,
you were both exhausted, and with good reason."

"But you did not tell me, Marian--"

"No," she interrupted; "nothing but a life-and-death emergency should have made me tell you
anything last night."

"Why, our little girl is becoming a soldier and a strategist. I think you had better make your
report over again, Mr. Merwyn;" and he drew out a fuller account of events than had been given
the evening before, also the result of the young man's morning observations.

Marian made no effort to secure attention beyond offering Merwyn a cup of coffee.

"I have breakfasted," he said, coldly.

"Take it, Merwyn, take it," cried Mr. Vosburgh. "Next to courage, nothing keeps up a soldier
better than coffee. According to your own view we have another hard day before us."

Merwyn complied, and bowed his thanks.

"Now for plans," resumed Mr. Vosburgh. "Are you going to police headquarters again?"

"Direct from here."

"I shall be there occasionally, and if you learn anything important, leave me a note. If I
am not there and you can get away, come here. Of course I only ask this as of a friend and
loyal man. You can see how vitally important it is that the authorities at Washington should
be informed. They can put forth vast powers, and will do so as the necessity is impressed upon
them. If we can only hold our own for a day or two the city will be full of troops. Therefore
remember that in aiding me you are helping the cause even more than by fighting with the best
and bravest, as you did yesterday. You recognize this fact, do you not? I am not laying any
constraint on you contrary to your sense of duty and inclination."

"No, sir, you are not. I should be dull indeed did I not perceive that you are burdened with
the gravest responsibilities. What is more, your knowledge guides, in a measure, the strong
national hand, and I now believe we shall need its aid."

"That's it, that's the point. Therefore you can see why I am eager to secure the assistance
of one who has the brains to appreciate the fact so quickly and fully. Moreover, you are cool,
and seem to understand the nature of this outbreak as if you had made a study of the mobs."

"I have, and I have been preparing for this one, for I knew that it would soon give me a chance
to prove that I was not a coward."

Marian's cheeks crimsoned.

"No more of that, if you please," said Mr. Vosburgh, gravely. "While it is natural that you
should feel strongly, you must remember that both I and my daughter have asked your pardon,
and that you yourself admitted that we had cause for misjudging you. We have been prompt to
make amends, and I followed you through yesterday's fight at some risk to see that you did
not fall into the hands of strangers, if wounded. I could have learned all about the fight
at a safer distance. You are now showing the best qualities of a soldier. Add to them a soldier's
full and generous forgiveness when a wrong is atoned for,--an unintentional wrong at that.
We trust you implicitly as a man of honor, but we also wish to work with you as a friend."

Mr. Vosburgh spoke with dignity, and the young fellow's face flushed under the reproof in his tone.

"I suppose I have become morbid on the subject," he said, with some embarrassment. "I now ask
your pardon, and admit that the expression was in bad taste, to say the least."

"Yes, it was, in view of the evident fact that we now esteem and honor you as a brave man.
I would not give you my hand in friendship and trust concerning matters vital to me were this
not so."

Merwyn took the proffered hand with a deep flush of pleasure.

"Having learned the bitterness of being misjudged," said Marian, quietly, "Mr. Merwyn should
be careful how he misjudges others."

"That's a close shot, Merwyn," said Mr. Vosburgh, laughing.

Their guest started and bent a keen glance on the girl's averted face, and then said, earnestly:
"Miss Vosburgh, your father has spoken frankly to me and I believe him. Your words, also, are
significant if they mean anything whatever. I know well what is before me to-day,--the chances
of my never seeing you again. I can only misjudge you in one respect. Perhaps I can best make
everything clear to your father as well as yourself by a single question. If I do my duty through
these troubles, Mr. Vosburgh being the judge, can you give me some place among those friends
who have already, and justly, won your esteem? I know it will require time. I have given you
far more cause for offence than you have given me, but I would be glad to fight to-day with
the inspiration of hope rather than that of recklessness."

Her lip trembled as she faltered: "You would see that you have such a place already were you
not equally prone to misjudge. Do you think me capable of cherishing a petty spite after you
had proved yourself the peer of my other friends?"

"That I have not done, and I fear I never can. You have seen that I have been under a strong
restraint which is not removed and which I cannot explain. To wear, temporarily, a policeman's
uniform is probably the best I can hope for."

"I was thinking of men, Mr. Merwyn, not uniforms. I have nothing whatever to do with the restraint
to which you refer. If my father trusts you, I can. Do not think of me so meanly as to believe
I cannot give honest friendship to the man who is risking his life to aid my father. Last evening
you said I had been off my guard. I must and will say, in self-defence, that if you judge me
by that hour of weakness and folly you misjudge me."

"Then we can be friends," he said, holding out his hand, his face full of the sunshine of gladness.

"Why not?" she replied, laughing, and taking his hand,--"that is, on condition that there is
no more recklessness."

Mr. Vosburgh rose and said, with a smile: "Now that there is complete amity in the camp we
will move on the enemy. I shall go with you, Merwyn, to police-headquarters;" and he hastily
began his preparation.

Left alone with Marian a moment, Merwyn said, "You cannot know how your words have changed
everything for me."

"I fear the spirit of the rioters is unchanged, and that you are about to incur fearful risks."

"I shall meet them cheerfully, for I have been under a thick cloud too long not to exult in
a little light at last."

"Ready?" said Mr. Vosburgh.

Again Merwyn took her hand and looked at her earnestly as he said, "Good-by, Heaven bless you,
whatever happens to me;" and he wondered at the tears that came into her eyes.

Making their way through streets which were now becoming thronged, Mr. Vosburgh and Merwyn
reached police headquarters without detention. They found matters there vastly changed for
the better: the whole police force well in hand; and General Harvey Brown, a most capable officer,
in command of several hundred soldiers.  Moreover, citizens, in response to a call from the
mayor, were being enrolled in large numbers as special policemen. Merwyn was welcomed by his
old companions under the command of Inspector Carpenter, and provided with a badge which would
indicate that he now belonged to the police force.

Telegrams were pouring in announcing trouble in different sections. Troops were drawn up in
line on Mulberry Street, ready for instant action, and were harangued by their officers in
earnest words which were heeded and obeyed, for the soldiers vied with the police in courage
and discipline.

Soon after his arrival Merwyn found himself marching with a force of policemen two hundred
and fifty strong, led by Carpenter and followed by a company of the military. The most threatening
gatherings were reported to be in Second and Third Avenues.

The former thoroughfare, when entered, was seen to be filled as far as the eye could reach,
the number of the throng being estimated at not less than ten thousand. At first this host
was comparatively quiet, apparently having no definite purpose or recognized leaders. Curiosity
accounted for the presence of many, the hope of plunder for that of more; but there were hundreds
of ferocious-looking men who thirsted for blood and lawless power. A Catholic priest, to his
honor be it said, had addressed the crowd and pleaded for peace and order; but his words, although
listened to respectfully, were soon forgotten. What this section of the mob, which was now
mustering in a score of localities, would have done first it is impossible to say; for as it
began to be agitated with passion, ready to precipitate its brutal force on any object that
caught its attention, the cry, "Cops and soldiers coming," echoed up the avenue from block
to block, a long, hoarse wave of sound.

Carpenter, with his force, marched quietly through the crowd from 21st to 32d Street, paying
no heed to the hootings, yells, and vile epithets that were hurled from every side. Dirty,
ragged women, with dishevelled hair and bloated faces, far exceeded the men in the use of Billingsgate;
and the guardians of the law, as they passed through those long lines of demoniacal visages,
scowling with hate, and heard their sulphurous invectives, saw what would be their fate if
overpowered. It was a conflict having all the horrors of Indian warfare, as poor Colonel O'Brien,
tortured to death through the long hot afternoon of that same day, learned in agony.

The mob in the street had not ventured on anything more offensive than jeers and curses, but
when Carpenter's command reached 32d Street it was assailed in a new and deadly manner. Rioters,
well provided with stones and brick-bats, had stationed themselves on the roofs, and, deeming
themselves secure, began to rain the missiles on the column below, which formed but too conspicuous
a mark. This was a new and terrible danger which Merwyn had not anticipated, and he wondered
how Carpenter would meet the emergency. Comrades were falling around him, and a stone grazed
his shoulder which would have brained him had it struck his head.

Their leader never hesitated a moment. The command, "Halt, charge those houses, brain every
devil that resists," rang down the line.

The crowd on the sidewalk gave way before the deeply incensed and resolute officers of the
law. Merwyn, with a half-dozen others, seized a heavy pole which had been cut down in order
to destroy telegraphic communication, and, using it as a ram, crashed in the door of a tall
tenement-house on the roof of which were a score of rioters, meantime escaping their missiles
as by a miracle. Rushing in, paying no heed to protests, and clubbing those who resisted, he
kept pace with the foremost. In his left hand, however, he carried his trusty revolver, for
he did not propose to be assassinated by skulkers in the dark passage-ways. Seeing a man levelling
a gun from a dusky corner, he fired instantly, and man and gun dropped. As the guardians of
the law approached the scuttle, having fought their way thither, the ruffians stood ready to
hurl down bricks, torn from the chimneys; but two or three well-aimed shots cleared the way,
and the policemen were on the roof, bringing down a man with every blow. One brawny fellow
rushed upon Merwyn, but received such a stroke on his temple that he fell, rolled off the roof,
and struck the pavement, a crushed and shapeless mass.

The assaults upon the other houses were equally successful, but the fight was a severe one,
and was maintained for nearly an hour. The mob was appalled by the fate of their friends, and
looked on in sullen, impotent anger.

Having cleared the houses, the police re-formed in the street, and marched away to other turbulent
districts.

Only the military were left, and had formed about a block further to the north. Beyond the
feeble demonstration of the invalid corps the rioters, as yet, had had no experience with the
soldiery. That policemen would use their clubs was to them a matter of course, but they scarcely
believed that cannon and musketry would be employed. Moreover, they were maddened and reckless
that so many of their best and bravest had been put hors de combat. The brief paralysis caused
by the remorseless clubs of the police passed, and like a sluggish monster, the mob, aroused
to sudden fury, pressed upon the soldiery, hurling not only the vilest epithets but every missile
on which they could lay their hands. Colonel O'Brien, in command for the moment, rode through
the crowd, supposing he could overawe them by his fearless bearing; but they only scoffed at
him, and the attack upon his men grew more bold and reckless.

The limit of patience was passed. "Fire!" he thundered, and the howitzers poured their deadly
canister point-blank into the throng. At the same time the soldiers discharged their muskets.
Not only men, but women fell on every side, one with a child in her arms.

A warfare in which women stand an equal chance for death and wounds is a terrible thing, and
yet this is usually an inseparable feature of mob-fighting. However, setting aside the natural
and instinctive horror at injuring a woman, the depraved creatures in the streets were deserving
of no more sympathy than their male abettors in every species of outrage. They did their utmost
to excite and keep alive the passions of the hour. Many were armed with knives, and did not
hesitate to use them, and when stronger hands broke in the doors of shops and dwellings they
swarmed after,--the most greedy and unscrupulous of plunderers. If a negro man, woman, or child
fell into their hands, none were more brutal than the unsexed hags of the mob.

If on this, and other occasions, they had remained in their homes they would not have suffered,
nor would the men have been so ferocious in their violence. They were the first to yield to
panic, however, and now their shrieks were the loudest and their efforts to escape out of the
deadly range of the guns the most frantic. In a few moments the avenue was cleared, and the
military marched away, leaving the dead and wounded rioters where they had fallen, as the police
had done before. Instantly the friends of the sufferers gathered them up and carried them into
concealment.

This feature, from the first, was one of the most marked characteristics of the outbreak. The
number of rioters killed and wounded could be only guessed at approximately, for every effort
was made to bury the bodies secretly, and keep the injured in seclusion until they either died
or recovered. Almost before a fight was over the prostrate rioters would be spirited away by
friends or relatives on the watch.

The authorities were content to have it so, for they had no place or time for the poor wretches,
and the police understood that they were to strike blows that would incapacitate the recipients
for further mischief.

In the same locality which had witnessed his morning fight, Colonel O'Brien, later in the day,
met a fate too horrible to be described.

CHAPTER XLVIII.

DESPERATE FIGHTING.

HAVING again reached police headquarters, Merwyn rested but a short time and then joined a
force of two hundred men under Inspector Dilkes, and returned to the same avenue in which he
had already incurred such peril. The mob, having discovered that it must cope with the military
as well as the police, became eager to obtain arms. It so happened that several thousand carbines
were stored in a wire factory in Second Avenue, and the rioters had learned the fact.  Therefore
they swarmed thither, forced an entrance, and began to arm themselves and their comrades. A
despatch to headquarters announced the attack at its commencement, and the force we have named
was sent off in hot haste to wrest from the mob the means of more effective resistance. Emerging
into the avenue from 21st Street, Dilkes found the thoroughfare solid with rioters, who, instead
of giving way, greeted the police with bitter curses. Hesitating not a moment on account of
vast inequality of numbers, the leader formed his men and charged. The mob had grown reckless
with every hour, and it now closed on the police with the ferocity of a wild beast. A terrible
hand-to-hand conflict ensued, and Merwyn found himself warding off and giving blows with the
enemy so near that he could almost feel their hot, tainted breath on his cheek, while horrid
visages inflamed with hate and fury made impressions on his mind that could not easily pass
away. It was a close, desperate encounter, and the scorching July sun appeared to kindle passion
on either side into tenfold intensity. While the police were disciplined men, obeying every
order and doing nothing at random, they WERE men, and they would not have been human if anger
and thoughts of vengeance had not nerved their arms as they struck down ruffians who would
show no more mercy to the wounded or captured than would a man-eating tiger.

Since the mob would not give way, the police cut a bloody path through the throng, and forced
their way like a wedge to the factory. Their orders were to capture all arms; and when a rioter
was seen with a carbine or a gun of any kind, one or more of the police would rush out of the
ranks and seize it, then fight their way back.

By the time they reached the factory so many of the mob had been killed or wounded, and so
many of their leaders were dead or disabled, that it again yielded to panic and fled. One desperate
leader, although already bruised and bleeding, had for a time inspired the mob with much of
his own reckless fury, and was left almost alone by his fleeing companions. His courage, which
should have been displayed in a better cause, cost him dear, for a tremendous blow sent him
reeling against a fence, the sharp point of one of the iron pickets caught under his chin,
and he hung there unheeded, impaled and dying. He was afterwards taken down, and beneath his
soiled overalls and filthy shirt was a fair, white skin, clad in cassimere trousers, a rich
waistcoat, and the finest of linen. His delicate, patrician features emphasized the mystery
of his personality and action.

When all resistance in the street was overcome, there still remained the factory, thronged
with armed and defiant rioters. Dilkes ordered the building to be cleared, and Merwyn took
his place in the storming party. We shall not describe the scenes that followed. It was a strife
that differed widely from Lane's cavalry charge on the lawn of a Southern plantation, with
the eyes of fair women watching his deeds. Merwyn was not taking part with thousands in a battle
that would be historic as Strahan and Blauvelt had done at Gettysburg. Every element of romance
and martial inspiration was wanting. It was merely a life-and-death encounter between a handful
of policemen and a grimy, desperate band of ruffians, cornered like rats, and resolved to sell
their lives dearly.

The building was cleared, and at last Merwyn, exhausted and panting, came back with his comrades
and took his place in the ranks. His club was bloody, and his revolver empty. The force marched
away in triumph escorting wagons loaded with all the arms they could find, and were cheered
by the better-disposed spectators that remained on the scene of action.

The desperate tenacity of the mob is shown by the fact that it returned to the wire factory,
found some boxes of arms that had been overlooked, filled the great five-story building and
the street about it, and became so defiant that the same battle had to be fought again in the
afternoon with the aid of the military.

For the sake of making a definite impression we have touched upon the conflicts taking place
in one locality. But throughout this awful day there were mobs all over the city, with fighting,
plundering, burning, the chasing and murdering of negroes occurring at the same time in many
and widely separated sections. Telegrams for aid were pouring into headquarters from all parts
of the city, large tracts of which were utterly unprotected. The police and military could
be employed only in bodies sufficiently large to cope with gatherings of hundreds or thousands.
Individual outrages and isolated instances of violence and plunder could not be prevented.

But law-abiding citizens were realizing their danger and awakening to a sense of their duty.
Over four hundred special policemen were sworn in. Merchants and bankers in Wall Street met
and resolved to close business. Millionnaires vied with their clerks and porters in patriotic
readiness to face danger. Volunteer companies were formed, and men like Hon. William E. Dodge,
always foremost in every good effort in behalf of the city, left their offices for military
duty.  While thousands of citizens escaped from the city, with their families, not knowing
where they would find a refuge, and obeying only the impulse to get away from a place apparently
doomed, other thousands remained, determined to protect their hearths and homes and to preserve
their fair metropolis from destruction. Terrible as was the mob, and tenfold more terrible
as it would have been if it had used its strength in an organized effort and with definite
purpose, forces were now awakening and concentrating against it which would eventually destroy
every vestige of lawlessness. With the fight on Broadway, during Monday evening, the supreme
crisis had passed. After that the mob fought desperate but losing battles. Acton, with Napoleonic
nerve and skill, had time to plan and organize. General Brown with his brave troops reached
him on Monday night, and thereafter the two men, providentially brought and kept together,
met and overcame, in cordial co-operation, every danger as it arose. Their names should never
be forgotten by the citizens of New York. Acton, as chief of police, was soon feared more than
any other man in the city, and he began to receive anonymous letters assuring him that he had
"but one more day to live." He tossed them contemptuously aside, and turned to the telegrams
imploring assistance. In every blow struck his iron will and heavy hand were felt. For a hundred
hours, through the storm, he kept his hand on the helm and never closed his eyes. He inspired
confidence in the men who obeyed him, and the humblest of them became heroes.

The city was smitten with an awful paralysis. Stages and street cars had very generally ceased
running; shops were closed; Broadway and other thoroughfares and centres usually so crowded
were at times almost deserted; now and then a hack would whirl by with occupants that could
not be classified. They might be leaders of the mob, detectives, or citizens in disguise bent
on public or private business. On one occasion a millionnaire whose name is known and honored
throughout the land, dressed in the mean habiliments of a laborer, drove a wagon up Broadway
in which was concealed a load of arms and ammunition. In hundreds of homes fathers and sons
kept watch with rifles and revolvers, while city and State authorities issued proclamations.

It was a time of strange and infinite vicissitude, yet apparently the mob steadily attained
vaster and more terrible proportions, and everywhere lawlessness was on the increase, especially
in the upper portions of the city.

Mr. Vosburgh, with stern and clouded brow, obtained information from all available sources,
and flashed the vital points to Washington. He did not leave Marian alone very long, and as
the day advanced kept one of his agents in the house during his absences. He failed to meet
Merwyn at headquarters, but learned of the young man's brave action from one of his wounded
comrades.

When Mr. Vosburgh told Marian of the risks which her new friend was incurring, and the nature
of the fighting in which he was engaged, she grew so pale and agitated that he saw that she
was becoming conscious of herself, of the new and controlling element entering into her life.

This self-knowledge was made tenfold clearer by a brief visit from Mrs. Ghegan.

"Oh! how dared you come?" cried Marian.

"The strates are safe enough for the loikes o' me, so oi kape out o' the crowds," was the reply,
"but they're no place fer ye, Miss Marian. Me brogue is a password iverywhere, an' even the
crowds is civil and dacent enough onless something wakes the divil in 'em;" and then followed
a vivid account of her experiences and of the timely help Merwyn had given her.

"The docthers think me Barney'll live, but oi thank Misther Merwyn that took him out o' the
very claws uv the bloody divils, and not their bat's eyes. Faix, but he tops all yez frin's,
Miss Marian, tho' ye're so could to 'im. All the spalpanes in the strates couldn't make 'im
wink, yet while I was a-wailin' over Barney he was as tender-feelin' as a baby."

The girl's heart fluttered strangely at the words of her former maid, but she tried to disguise
her emotion. When again left alone she strained her ears for every sound from the city, and
was untiring in her watch. From noon till evening she kept a dainty lunch ready for Merwyn,
but he did not come.

After the young man's return from his second fight he was given some rest. In the afternoon,
he, with others, was sent on duty to the west side, the force being carried thither in stages
which Acton had impressed into the service. One driver refused to stir, saying, insolently,
that he had "not been hired to carry policemen."

"Lock that man in cell No. 4," was Acton's answer, while, in the same breath, he ordered a
policeman to drive.

That was the superintendent's style of arguing and despatching business.

Merwyn again saw plenty of service, for the spirit of pandemonium was present in the west side.
Towards evening, however, the rioters ceased their aimless and capricious violence, and adopted
in their madness the dangerous method of Parisian mobs. They began throwing up a series of
barricades in Eighth Avenue. Vehicles of all kinds within reach, telegraph poles, boxes,--anything
that would obstruct,--were wired together. Barricades were also erected on cross-streets, to
prevent flank movements. Captain Walling, of the police, who was on duty in the precinct, appreciated
the importance of abolishing this feature from street fighting as speedily as possible, and
telegraphed to headquarters for a co-operating military force. He also sent to General Sanford,
at the arsenal, for troops. They were promised, but never sent. General Brown, fortunately,
was a man of a very different stamp from Sanford, and he promptly sent a body of regulars.

Captain Slott took command of the police detailed to co-operate with the soldiers, and, with
their officers, waited impatiently and vainly for the company promised by Sanford. Meanwhile
the mob was strengthening its defences with breathless energy, and the sun was sinking in the
west. As the difficult and dangerous work to be done required daylight it was at last resolved
to wait no longer.

As the assailants drew near the barricade, they received a volley, accompanied by stones and
other missiles. The police fell back a little to the left, and the troops, advancing, returned
the fire. But the rioters did not yield, and for a time the crash of musketry resounded through
the avenue, giving the impression of a regular pitched battle. The accurate aim of the soldiers,
however, at last decided the contest, and the rioters fled to the second barricade, followed
by the troops, while the police tore away the captured obstruction.

Obtaining a musket and cartridges from a wounded soldier, Merwyn, by explaining that he was
a good marksman, obtained the privilege of fighting on the left flank of the military.

The mob could not endure the steady, well-directed fire of the regulars, and one barricade
after another was carried, until the rioters were left uncovered when they fled, shrieking,
yelling, cursing in their impotent rage,--the police with their clubs and the soldiers with
their rifles following and punishing them until the streets were clear.

Merwyn, having been on duty all day, obtained a leave of absence till the following morning,
and, availing himself of his old device to save time and strength, went to a livery stable
near the station-house and obtained a hack by payment of double the usual fare. Mounting the
box with the driver, and avoiding crowds, he was borne rapidly towards Mr. Vosburgh's residence.
He was not only terribly exhausted, but also consumed with anxiety as to the safety of the
girl who had never been absent long from his thoughts, even in moments of the fiercest conflict.

CHAPTER XLIX.

ONE FACING HUNDREDS.

THE evening was growing dusky when Merwyn dismissed his carriage and hastened to Mr. Vosburgh's
residence. Marian and her father had waited for him until their faces were clouded with anxiety
by reason of his long delay. The young girl's attempt to dine with her father was but a formal
pretence.

At last she exclaimed, "Something must have happened to Mr. Merwyn!"

"Do not entertain gloomy thoughts, my dear. A hundred things besides an injury might have detained
him. Keep a good dinner ready, and I think he'll do justice to it before the evening is over."

Even then the German servant announced his presence at the basement door, which, in view of
the disguises worn, was still used as the place of ingress and egress.

Mr. Vosburgh hastened to welcome him, while Marian bustled around to complete her preparations.
When he entered the dining-room he did indeed appear weary and haggard, a fair counterpart
of the rioters whom he had been fighting.

"Only necessity, Miss Vosburgh, compels me to present myself in this scarecrow aspect," he
said. "I've had no time or chance for anything better. I can soon report to your father all
that is essential, and then can go home and return later."

"I shall be much hurt if you do so," said Marian, reproachfully. "I kept a lunch prepared for
you during the afternoon, and now have a warm dinner all ready. It will be very ungracious
in you to go away and leave it."

"But I look like a coal-heaver."

"Oh, I've seen well-dressed men before. They are no novelty; but a man direct from a field
of battle is quite interesting. Will you please take this chair? You are not in the least like
my other friends. They obey me without questionings."

"You must remember," he replied, "that the relation is to me as new and strange as it is welcome.
I shall need a great deal of discipline."

"When you learn what a martinet I can be you may repent, like many another who has obtained
his wish. Here we shall reverse matters. Everything is topsy-turvy now, you know, so take this
coffee at the beginning of your dinner."

"I admit that your orders differ widely from those of police captains." Then he added, with
quiet significance, "No; I shall not repent."

"Mr. Merwyn, will you take an older man's advice?"

"Certainly. Indeed, I am under your orders, also, for the night."

"I'm glad to hear it, for it will be a night of deep anxiety to me.  Make a very light dinner,
and take more refreshment later. You are too much exhausted to dine now. You need not tell
me of your morning adventures. I learned about those at headquarters."

"I have heard about them too," Marian added, with a look that warmed the young fellow's soul.
"I have also had a visit from Mrs. Ghegan, and her story was not so brief as yours."

"From what section have you just come?" Mr. Vosburgh asked.

Merwyn gave a brief description of the condition of affairs on the west side, ending with an
account of the fight at the barricades.

"In one respect you are like my other friends, only more so," Marian said. "You are inclined
to give me Hamlet with Hamlet left out. What part did you take at the barricades?"

He told her in a matter-of-fact way.

"Ah, yes, I understand. I am learning to read between the lines of your stories."

"Well, Heaven be thanked," ejaculated Mr. Vosburgh, "that you demolished the barricades! If
the rioters adopt that mode of fighting us, we shall have far greater difficulty in coping
with them."

At last Mr. Vosburgh said, "Will you please come with me to my library for a few minutes?"

On reaching the apartment he closed the door, and continued, gravely: "Mr. Merwyn, I am in
sore straits. You have offered to aid me. I will tell you my situation, and then you must do
as you think best. I know that you have done all a man's duty to-day and have earned the right
to complete rest. You will also naturally wish to look after your own home. Nevertheless my
need and your own words lead me to suggest that you stay here to-night, or at least through
the greater portion of it. I fear that I have been recognized and followed,--that I have enemies
on my track. I suspect the man whom I discharged from the care of my office. Yet I must go
out, for I have important despatches to send, and--what is of more consequence--I must make
some careful observations. The mob seems to be a mere lawless, floundering monster, bent chiefly
on plunder; but the danger is that leaders are organizing its strength as a part of the rebellion.
You can understand that, while I look upon the outbreak with the solicitude of a citizen whose
dearest interests are at stake, I also, from habit of mind and duty, must study it as a part
of the great campaign of the year. If there are organizers at work there will be signals to-night,
and I can see them from a tall neighboring church-spire. Yet how can I leave my child alone? How--"

"Mr. Vosburgh," cried Merwyn, "what honor or privilege could I ask greater than that of being
your daughter's protector during your absence? I understand you perfectly. You feel that you
must do your duty at any cost to yourself. After what you have said, nothing could induce me
to go away. Indeed, I would stand guard without your door, were there no place for me within."

"There, I won't thank you in words," said the elder man, wringing Merwyn's hand. "Will you
do as I wish?"

"Yes, sir."

"Then lie down on the sofa in the front parlor and sleep while you can. The least disturbance
in the street would waken you there. Marian will watch from an upper window and give you warning
if anything occurs. It is possible that I may be set upon when returning home, but I think
not, for I shall enter the house from the rear;" and he told the young man of the means of
exit which he had secured in case the house was attacked. "Rather than permit my child to take
any risks," concluded the father, solemnly, "fly with her and the woman who will be her companion
till I return. Beyond the fact of general danger to all homes, she does not suspect anything,
nor shall I increase her anxieties by telling her of my fears. She will be vigilant on general
principles. Have you arms?"

"I have fired most of my cartridges to-day."

"Well here is a revolver and a repeating rifle that you can depend upon. Do you understand
the latter weapon?"

"Yes, I have one like it."

"I will now tell Marian of my plans, so far as it is wise for her to know them, and then, God
help and protect us all! Come, I wish you to lie down at once, for every moment of rest may
be needed."

When they descended, Mr. Vosburgh said to his daughter, laughingly, "Mr. Merwyn is under orders,
and can have nothing more to say to you to-night."

The young fellow, in like vein, brought the rifle to his shoulder, presented arms to her, wheeled,
and marched to his station in the darkened front parlor. Before lying down, however, he opened
one blind for an outlook.

"Do you fear any special danger to-night, papa?" Marian asked, quickly.

"I have been expecting special dangers from the first," replied her father, gently. "While
I must do my duty I shall also take such precautions as I can. Merwyn will be your protector
during my absence. Now take your station at your upper window and do your part." He explained
briefly what he expected of her. "In case of an attack," he concluded, almost sternly, "you
must fly before it is too late. I shall now go and prepare Mr. Erkmann for the possible emergency,
and then go out through the basement door as usual, after giving our loyal German her directions."

A few moments later he had departed, all were at their posts, and the house was quiet.

Merwyn felt the necessity of rest, for every bone in his body ached from fatigue; but he did
not dream of the possibility of sleep. His heart was swelling with pride and joy that he had
become, not only the friend of the girl he loved, but also her trusted protector.

But at last Nature claimed her dues, and he succumbed and slept.

Mr. Vosburgh, unmolested, climbed to his lofty height of observation. The great city lay beneath
him with its myriad lights, but on Third Avenue, from 40th Street northward for a mile, there
was a hiatus of darkness. There the mob had begun, and there still dwelt its evil spirit uncurbed.
The rioters in that district had cut off the supply of gas, feeling, as did the French revolutionists,
that "Light was not in order."

Mr. Vosburgh watched that long stretch of gloom with the greatest anxiety. Suddenly from its
mystery a rocket flamed into the sky. Three minutes elapsed and another threw far and wide
its ominous light. Again there was an interval of three minutes, when a third rocket confirmed
the watcher's fears that these were signals. Four minutes passed, and then, from the vicinity
of Union Square, what appeared to be a great globe of fire rose to an immense height. A few
seconds later there was an answering rocket far off in the eastern districts of Brooklyn.

These were indeed portents in the sky, and Mr. Vosburgh was perplexed as to their significance.
Were they orders or at least invitations, for a general uprising against all authority? Was
the rebellion against the government about to become general in the great centres of population?
With the gloomiest of forebodings he watched for two hours longer, but only heard the hoarse
murmur of the unquiet city, which occasionally, off to the west, became so loud as to suggest
the continuance of the strife of the day. At last he went to the nearest available point and
sent his despatches, then stole by a circuitous route to the dwelling of Mr. Erkmann, who was
watching for him.

Marian's vigilance was sleepless. While she had been burdened throughout the day with the deepest
anxieties, she had been engaged in no exhausting efforts, and the novelty of her present position
and her new emotions banished the possibility of drowsiness. She felt as if she had lived years
during the past two days. The city was full of dangers nameless and horrible, yet she was conscious
of an exaltation of spirit and of a happiness such as she had never known.

The man whom she had despised as a coward was her protector, and she wondered at her sense
of security. She almost longed for an opportunity to prove that her courage could now be equal
to his, and her eyes flashed in the darkness as they glanced up and down the dusky street;
again they became gentle in her commiseration of the weary man in the room below, and gratefully
she thanked God that he had been spared through the awful perils of the day.

Suddenly her attention was caught by the distant tramp of many feet.  She threw open a blind
and listened with a beating heart. Yes, a mob was coming, nearer, nearer; they are at the corner.
With a sudden outburst of discordant cries they are turning into this very street.

A moment later her hand was upon Merwyn's shoulder. "Wake, wake," she cried; "the mob is coming--is
here."

He was on his feet instantly with rifle in hand. Through the window he saw the dusky forms
gathering about the door. The German woman stood behind Marian, crying and wringing her hands.

"Miss Vosburgh, you and the woman do as I bid," Merwyn said, sternly. "Go to the rear of the
hall, open the door, and if I say, 'Fly,' or if I fall, escape for your lives."

"But what will you--"

"Obey!" he cried, with a stamp of his foot.

They were already in the hall, and did as directed.

Imagine Marian's wonder as she saw him throw open the front door, step without, and fire instantly.
Then, dropping his rifle on his arm, he began to use his revolver. She rushed to his side and
saw the mob, at least three hundred strong, scattering as if swept away by a whirlwind.

Merwyn's plan of operations had been bold, but it proved the best one. In the streets he had
learned the effect of fearless, decisive action, and he had calculated correctly on the panic
which so often seized the undisciplined hordes. They probably believed that his boldness was
due to the fact that he had plenty of aid at hand. So long as there was a man within range
he continued to fire, then became aware of Marian's presence.

"O Miss Vosburgh," he said, earnestly, "you should not look on sights like these;" for a leader
of the mob lay motionless on the pavement beneath them.

He took her hand, which trembled, led her within, and refastened the door. Her emotion was
so strong that she dared not speak.

"Why did you take such a risk?" he asked, gravely. "What would your father have said to me
if one of those wretches had fired and wounded you?"

"I--I only realized one thing--that you were facing hundreds all alone," she faltered.

"Why, Miss Marian, I was only doing my duty, and I took the safest way to perform it. I had
learned from experience that the bluff game is generally the best. No doubt I gave those fellows
the impression that there were a dozen armed men in the house."

But her emotion was too strong for control, and she sobbed: "It was the bravest thing I ever
heard of. Oh! I have done you SUCH wrong! Forgive me. I--I--can't--" and she hastened up the
dusky stairway, followed by her servant, who was profuse in German interjections.

"I am repaid a thousand-fold," was Merwyn's quiet comment. "My oath cannot blight my life now."

Sleep had been most effectually banished from his eyes, and as he stood in the unlighted apartment,
motionless and silent, looking out upon the dusky street, but a few moments passed before a
man and a woman approached cautiously, lifted the slain rioter, and bore him away.

In less than half an hour Mr. Vosburgh entered his house from the rear so silently that he
was almost beside Merwyn before his approach was recognized.

"What, Merwyn!" he exclaimed, with a little chiding in his tone; "is this the way you rest?
You certainly haven't stood here, 'like Patience on a monument,' since I left?"

"No, indeed. You are indebted to Miss Vosburgh that you have a home to come to, for I slept
so soundly that the house might have been carried off bodily. The mob has been here."

"O papa!" cried Marian, clasping her arms about his neck, "thank God you are back safe! Oh,
it was all so sudden and terrible!"

"But how, how, Merwyn? What has happened?"

"Well, sir, Miss Vosburgh was a better sentinel than I, and heard the first approach of the
ruffians. I was sleeping like old Rip himself. She wakened me. A shot or two appeared to create
a panic, and they disappeared like a dream, as suddenly as they had come."

"Just listen to him, papa!" cried the girl, now reassured by her father's presence, and recovering
from her nervous shock. "Why shouldn't he sleep after such a day as he has seen? It was his
duty to sleep, wasn't it? The idea of two sentinels in a small garrison keeping awake, watching
the same points!"

"I'm very glad you obtained some sleep, Merwyn, and surely you had earned it; but as yet I
have a very vague impression of this mob and of the fight. I looked down the street but a few
moments ago, and it seemed deserted. It is quiet now. Have you not both slept and dreamed?"

"No, papa," said the girl, shudderingly; "there's a dead man at the foot of our steps even now."

"You are mistaken, Miss Vosburgh. As usual, his friends lost no time in carrying him off."

"Well, well," cried Mr. Vosburgh, "this is a longer story than I can listen to without something
to sustain the inner man. "Riten,"--to the servant,--"some fresh coffee please. Now for the
lighted dining-room,--that's hidden from the street,--where we can look into each other's faces.
So much has happened the last two days that here in the dark I begin to feel as if it all were
a nightmare. Ah! how cosey and home-like this room seems after prowling in the dangerous streets
with my hand on the butt of a revolver! Come now, Marian, sit down quietly and tell the whole
story. I can't trust Merwyn at all when he is the hero of the tale."

"You may well say that. I hope, sir," with a look of mock severity at the young fellow, "that
your other reports to papa are more accurate than the one I have heard. Can you believe it,
papa? he actually threw open the front door and faced the entire mob alone."

"I beg your pardon, Miss Vosburgh, as I emptied my revolver and looked around, a lady stood
beside me. I've seen men do heroic things to-day, but nothing braver than that."

"But I didn't think!" cried the girl; "I didn't realize--" and then she paused, while her face
crimsoned. Her heart had since told her why she had stepped to his side.

"But you would have thought twice, yes, a hundred times," said Merwyn, laughing, "if you hadn't
been a soldier. Jove! how Strahan will stare when he hears of it!"

"Please, never tell him," exclaimed the girl.

Her father now stood encircling her with his arm, and looking fondly down upon her. "Well,
thank God we're all safe yet! and, threatening as is the aspect of affairs, I believe we shall
see happy days of peace and security before very long."

"I am so glad that mamma is not in the city!" said Marian, earnestly.

"Oh that you were with her, my child!"

"I'm better contented where I am," said the girl, with a decided little nod.

"Yes, but great God! think of what might have happened if Merwyn had not been here,--what might
still have happened had he not had the nerve to take, probably, the only course which could
have saved you!  There, there, I can't think of it, or I shall be utterly unnerved."

"Don't think of it, papa. See, I'm over the shock of it already. Now don't you be hysterical
as I was yesterday."

He made a great effort to rally, but it was evident that the strong man was deeply agitated.
They all, however, soon regained self-control and composure, and spent a genial half-hour together,
Merwyn often going to the parlor, that he might scan the street. After a brief discussion of
plans for the morrow they separated for the night, Merwyn resuming his bivouac in the parlor.
After listening for a time he was satisfied that even mobs must rest, and, as the soldiers
slept on their arms, he slumbered, his rifle in hand.

When Marian bade her father good-night he took her face in his hands and gazed earnestly down
upon it. The girl understood his expression, and the color came into her fair countenance like
a June dawn.

"Do you remember, darling, my words when I said, 'I do not know how much it might cost you
in the end to dismiss Mr. Merwyn finally'?"

"Yes, papa."

"Are you not learning how much it might have cost you?"

"Yes, papa," with drooping eyes.

He kissed her, and nothing more was said.

CHAPTER L.

ZEB.

MERWYN awoke early, and, as soon as he heard the German servant coming down-stairs, wrote a
line to Mr. Vosburgh saying that he would call on his way to headquarters, and then hastened
through the almost deserted streets to his own home. To his great satisfaction he found everything
unchanged there. After luxuriating in a bath and a bountiful breakfast he again instructed
his man to be on the watch, and to keep up a fire throughout the coming night, so that a hot
meal might be had speedily at any time.

More than once the thought had crossed his mind: "Unless we make greater headway with the riot,
that attack on Mr. Vosburgh's house will be repeated. Vengeance alone would now prompt the
act, and besides he is undoubtedly a marked man. There's no telling what may happen. Our best
course is to fight, fight, knock the wretches on the head. With the quelling of the mob comes
safety;" and, remembering the danger that threatened Marian, he was in a savage mood.

On this occasion, he went directly to Mr. Vosburgh's residence, resolving to take no risks
out of the line of duty. His first thought now was the securing of Marian's safety. He had
learned that there was no longer any special need for personal effort on his part to gain information,
since the police authorities had wires stretching to almost every part of the city. An account
of the risks taken to keep up this telegraphic communication would make a strange, thrilling
chapter in itself. Moreover, police detectives were busy everywhere, and Mr. Vosburgh at headquarters
and with the aid of his own agents could now obtain all the knowledge essential.  Therefore
the young fellow's plan was simple, and he indicated his course at once after a cordial greeting
from Mr. Vosburgh and Marian.

"Hard fighting appears to me to be the way to safety," said he. "I can scarcely believe that
the rioters will endure more than another day of such punishment as they received yesterday.
Indeed, I should not be surprised if to-day was comparatively quiet."

"I agree with you," said Mr. Vosburgh, "unless the signals I saw last night indicate a more
general uprising than has yet taken place. The best elements of the city are arming and organizing.
There is a deep and terrible anger rising against the mob and all its abettors and sympathizers."

"I know it," cried Merwyn; "I feel it myself. When I think of the danger which threatened your
home and especially Miss Vosburgh, I feel an almost ungovernable desire to be at the wretches."

"But that means greater peril for you," faltered the young girl.

"No, it means the shortest road to safety for us all. A mob is like fire: it must be stamped
out of existence as soon as possible."

"I think Merwyn is right," resumed Mr. Vosburgh. "Another day of successful fighting will carry
us to safety, for the general government is moving rapidly in our behalf, and our militia regiments
are on their way home. I'll be ready to go to headquarters with you in a minute."

"Oh, please do not be rash to-day. If you had fallen yesterday think what might have happened,"
said Marian.

"Every blow I strike to-day, Miss Vosburgh, will be nerved by the thought that you have one
enemy, one danger, the less; and I shall esteem it the greatest of privileges if I can remain
here to-night again as one of your protectors."

"I cannot tell you what a sense of security your presence gives me," she replied. "You seem
to know just what to do and how to do it."

"Well," he answered, with a grim laugh, "one learns fast in these times. A very stern necessity
is the mother of invention."

"Yes," sighed the girl, "one learns fast. Now that I have seen war, it is no longer a glorious
thing, but full of unspeakable horrors."

"This is not war," said Merwyn, a little bitterly. "I pity, while I detest, the poor wretches
we knock on the head. Your friends, who have fought the elite of the South will raise their
eyebrows if they hear us call this war."

"I have but one friend who has faced a mob alone," she replied, with a swift, shy glance.

"A friend whom that privilege made the most fortunate of men," he replied. "Had the rioters
been Southern soldiers, they would have shot me instantly, instead of running away."

"All my friends soon learn that I am stubborn in my opinions," was her laughing reply, as her
father joined them.

Mr. Erkmann on the next street north was a sturdy, loyal man, and he permitted Mr. Vosburgh
and Merwyn to pass out through his house, so that to any one who was watching the impression
would be given that at least two men were in the house. Burdened with a sense of danger, Mr.
Vosburgh had resolved on brief absences, believing that at headquarters and through his agents
he could learn the general drift of events.

Broadway wore the aspect of an early Sunday morning in quiet times. Pedestrians were few, and
the stages had ceased running. The iron shutters of the great Fifth Avenue and other hotels
were securely fastened. No street cars jingled along the side avenues; shops were closed; and
the paralysis of business was almost complete in its greatest centres. At police headquarters,
however, the most intense activity prevailed. Here were gathered the greater part of the police
force and of the military co-operating with it The neighboring African church was turned into
a barrack. Acton occupied other buildings, with or without the consent of the owners.

The top floor of the police building was thronged with colored refugees, thankful indeed to
have found a place of safety, but many were consumed with anxiety on account of absent ones.

The sanguine hopes for a more quiet day were not fulfilled, but the severest fighting was done
by the military, and cavalry now began to take part in the conflict. On the west side, Seventh
Avenue was swept again and again with grape and canister before the mob gave way. On the east
side there were several battles, and in one of them, fought just before night, the troops were
compelled to retreat, leaving some of their dead and wounded in the streets.  General Brown
sent Captain Putnam with one hundred and fifty regulars to the scene of disaster and continued
violence, and a sanguinary conflict ensued between ten and eleven o'clock at night.  Putnam
swept the dimly lighted streets with his cannon, and when the rioters fled into the houses
he opened such a terrible fire upon them as to subdue all resistance. The mob was at last learning
that the authorities would neither yield nor scruple to make use of any means in the conflict.

In the great centres down town, things were comparatively quiet. The New York Times took matters
into its own hands. A glare of light from the windows of its building was shed after night-fall
over Printing-House Square, and editors and reporters had their rifles as readily within reach
as their pens.

We shall not follow Merwyn's adventures, for that would involve something like a repetition
of scenes already described. As the day was closing, however, he took part in an affair which
explained the mystery of Mammy Borden's disappearance.

During the first day of the riot the colored woman had seen enough to realize her own danger
and that of her son, and she was determined to reach him and share his fate, whatever it might
be.  She had no scruple in stealing away from Mr. Vosburgh's house, for by her departure she
removed a great peril from her employers and friends. She was sufficiently composed, however,
to put on a heavy veil and gloves, and so reached her son in safety. Until the evening of the
third day of the riot, the dwelling in which they cowered escaped the fury of the mob, although
occupied by several colored families. At last the hydra-headed monster fixed one of its baleful
eyes upon the spot. Just as the occupants of the house were beginning to hope, the remorseless
wretches came, and the spirit of Tophet broke loose. The door was broken in with axes, and
savage men streamed into the dwelling. The poor victims tried to barricade themselves in the
basement, but their assailants cut the water-pipes and would have drowned them. Driven out
by this danger, the hunted creatures sought to escape through the yard. As Zeb was lifting
his mother over the fence the rioters came upon her and dragged her back.

"Kill me, kill me," cried Zeb, "but spare my mother."

They seemed to take him at his word. Two of the fiends held his arms, while another struck
him senseless and apparently dead with a crowbar. Then, not accepting this heroic self-sacrifice,
they began to beat the grief-frenzied mother. But retribution was at hand. The cries of the
victims and the absorption of the rioters in their brutal work prevented them from hearing
the swift, heavy tread of the police. A moment later Merwyn and others rushed through the hallway,
and the ruffians received blows similar to the one which had apparently bereft poor Zeb of
life. The rioters were either dispersed or left where they fell, a wagon was impressed, and
Zeb and his mother were brought to headquarters. Merwyn had soon recognized Mrs. Borden, but
she could not be comforted. Obtaining leave of absence, the young man waited until the evening
grew dusky; then securing a hack from a stable near headquarters, the proprietor of which was
disposed to loyalty by reason of his numerous blue-coated neighbors, he took the poor woman
and the scarcely breathing man to a hospital, and left money for their needs. The curtains
of the carriage had been closely drawn; but if the crowds through which they sometimes passed
had guessed its occupants, they would have instantly met a tragic fate, while Merwyn's and
the driver's chances would have been scarcely better.

CHAPTER LI.

A TRAGEDY.

MR. VOSBURGH and his daughter had passed a very anxious day, the former going out but seldom.
The information obtained from the city had not been reassuring, for while the authorities had
under their direction larger bodies of men, and lawlessness was not so general, the mob was
still unquelled and fought with greater desperation in the disaffected centres. In the after-part
of the day Mr. Vosburgh received the cheering intelligence that the Seventh Regiment would
arrive that night, and that other militia organizations were on their way home. Therefore he
believed that if they escaped injury until the following morning all cause for deep anxiety
would pass away. As the hours elapsed and no further demonstration was made against his home,
his hopes grew apace, and now, as he and his daughter waited for Merwyn before dining, he said,
"I fancy that the reception given to the mob last night has curbed their disposition to molest us."

"O papa, what keeps Mr. Merwyn?"

"Well, my dear, I know he was safe at noon."

"Oh, oh, I do hope that this will be the last day of this fearful suspense! Isn't it wonderful
what Mr. Merwyn has done in the past few days?"

"Not so wonderful as it seems. Periods like these always develop master-spirits, or rather
they give such spirits scope. How little we knew of Acton before this week! yet at the beginning
he seized the mob by the throat and has not once relaxed his grasp. He has been the one sleepless
man in the city, and how he endures the strain is almost beyond mortal comprehension. The man
and the hour came together. The same is true of Merwyn in his sphere. He had been preparing
for this, hoping that it would give him an opportunity to right himself. Fearless as the best
of your friends, he combines with courage the singularly cool, resolute nature inherited from
his father. He is not in the least ambitious for distinction, but is only bent on carrying
out his own aims and purposes."

"And what are they, papa?"

"Sly fox! as if you did not know. Who first came to your protection?"

"And to think how I treated him!"

"Quite naturally, under the circumstances. The mystery of his former restraint is still unexplained,
but I now think it due to family reasons. Yet why he should be so reluctant to speak of them
is still another mystery. He has no sympathy with the South or his mother's views, yet why
should he not say, frankly, 'I cannot fight against my mother's people'? When we think, however,
that the sons of the same mother are often arrayed against each other in this war, such a reason
as I have suggested appears entirely inadequate. All his interests are at the North, and he
is thoroughly loyal; but when I intimated, last evening, that he might wish to spend the night
in his own home to insure its protection, it seemed less than nothing to him compared with
your safety. He has long had this powerful motive to win your regard, and yet there has been
some restraint more potent."

"But you trust him now, papa?"

"Yes."

Thus they talked until the clock struck eight, and Marian, growing pallid with anxiety and
fear, went to the darkened parlor window to watch for Merwyn, then returned and looked at her
father with something like dismay on her face.

Before he could speak, she exclaimed, "Ah! there is his ring;" and she rushed toward the door,
paused, came back, and said, blushingly, "Papa, you had better admit him."

Mr. Vosburgh smilingly complied.

The young fellow appeared in almost as bad a plight as when he had come in on Monday night
and gone away with bitter words on his lips.  He was gaunt from fatigue and long mental strain.
His first words were: "Thank God you we still all safe! I had hoped to be here long before
this, but so much has happened!"

"What!" exclained Marian, "anything worse than took place yesterday?"

"No, and yes." Then, with an appealing look; "Miss Marian, a cup of your good coffee. I feel
as if a rioter could knock me down with a feather."

She ran to the kitchen herself to see that it was of the best possible quality, and Merwyn,
sinking into a chair, looked gloomily at his host and said: "We have made little if any progress.
The mob grows more reckless and devilish."

"My dear fellow," cried Mr. Vosburgh, "the Seventh Regiment will be here to-night, and others
are on the way;" and he told of the reassuring tidings he had received.

"Thank Heaven for your news! I have been growing despondent during the last few hours."

"Take this and cheer up," cried Marian. "The idea of your being despondent! You are only tired
to death, and will have a larger appetite for fighting to-morrow, I fear, than ever."

"No; I witnessed a scene this evening that made me sick of it all. Of course I shall do my
duty to the end, but I wish that others could finish it up. More than ever I envy your friends
who can fight soldiers;" and then he told them briefly of the scene witnessed in the rescue
of Mammy Borden and her son.

"Oh, horrible! horrible!" exclaimed the girl. "Where are they now?"

"I took them from headquarters to a hospital. They both need the best surgical attention, though
poor Zeb, I fear, is past help."

"Merwyn," said Mr. Vosburgh, gravely, "you incurred a fearful risk in taking those people through
the streets."

"I suppose so," replied the young fellow, quietly; "but in a sense they were a part of your
household, and the poor creatures were in such a desperate plight that--"

"Mr. Merwyn," cried Marian, a warm flush mantling her face, "you are a true knight. You have
perilled your life for the poor and humble."

He looked at her intently a moment, and then said, quietly, "I would peril it again a thousand
times for such words from YOU."

To hide a sudden confusion she exclaimed: "Great Heavens! what differences there are in men!
Those who would torture and kill these inoffensive people have human forms."

"Men are much what women make them; and it would almost seem that women are the chief inspiration
of this mob. The draft may have been its inciting cause, but it has degenerated into an insatiable
thirst for violence, blood, and plunder. I saw an Irishwoman to-day who fought like a wild-cat
before she would give up her stolen goods."

The German servant Riten now began to place dinner on the table, Mr.  Vosburgh remarking, "We
had determined to wait for you on this occasion."

"What am I thinking of?" cried Merwyn. "If this thing goes on I shall become uncivilized. Mr.
Vosburgh, do take me somewhere that I may bathe my hands and face, and please let me exchange
this horrid blouse, redolent of the riot, for almost any kind of garment. I could not sit at
the table with Miss Vosburgh in my present guise."

"Yes, papa, give him your white silk waistcoat and dress-coat," added Marian, laughing.

"Come with me," said Mr. Vosburgh, "and I'll find you an outfit for the sake of your own comfort."

"I meant to trespass on your kindness when I first came in, but mind and body seemed almost
paralyzed. I feel better already, however. While we are absent may I ask if you have your weapons
ready?"

"Yes, I have a revolver on my person, and my rifle is in the dining-room."

A few moments later the gentlemen descended, Merwyn in a sack-coat that hung rather loosely
on his person. Before sitting down he scanned the street, which was quiet.

"My former advice, Merwyn," said his host; "you must make a light meal and wait until you are
more rested."

"O papa, what counsel to give a guest!"

"Counsel easily followed," said Merwyn. "I crave little else than coffee. Indeed, your kindness,
Miss Vosburgh, has so heartened me, that I am rallying fast."

"Since everything is to be in such great moderation, perhaps I have been too prodigal of that,"
was the arch reply.

"I shall be grateful for much or little."

"Oh, no, don't put anything on the basis of gratitude. I have too much of that to be chary of it."

"A happy state of affairs," said Merwyn, "since what you regard as services on my part are
priceless favors to me. I can scarcely realize it, and have thought of it all day, that I only,
of all your friends, can be with you now. Strahan will be green with envy, and so I suppose
will the others."

"I do not think any the less of them because it is impossible for them to be here," said the
young girl, blushing.

"Of course not. It's only my immense good fortune. They would give their right eyes to stand
in my shoes."

"I hope I may soon hear that they are all recovering. I fear that Mr. Lane's and Mr. Strahan's
wounds are serious; and, although Mr. Blauvelt made light of his hurt, he may find that it
is no trifle."

"It would seem that I am doomed to have no honorable scars."

"Through no fault of yours, Mr. Merwyn. I've thought so much of poor mamma to-day! She must
be wild with anxiety about us."

"I think not," said Mr. Vosburgh. "I telegraphed to her yesterday and to-day. I admit they
were rather misleading messages."

From time to time Mr. Vosburgh went to the outlook on the street, but all remained apparently
quiet in their vicinity. Yet an hour of fearful peril was drawing near. A spirit of vengeance,
and a desire to get rid of a most dangerous enemy, prompted another attack on Mr.  Vosburgh's
home that night; and, taught by former experience, the assailants had determined to approach
quietly and fight till they should accomplish their purpose. They meant to strike suddenly,
swiftly, and remorselessly.

The little group in the dining-room, however, grew confident with every moment of immunity;
yet they could not wholly banish their fears, and Mr. Vosburgh explained to Merwyn how he had
put bars on the outside of the doors opening into the back yard, a bolt also on the door leading
down-stairs to the basement.

But they dined very leisurely, undisturbed; then at Marian's request the gentlemen lighted
their cigars. Mr. Vosburgh strolled away to see that all was quiet and secure.

"I shouldn't have believed that I could rally so greatly in so short a time," said Merwyn,
leaning back luxuriously in his chair. "Last night I was overcome with drowsiness soon after
I lay down. I now feel as if I should never want to sleep again. It will be my turn to watch
to-night, and you must sleep."

"Yes, when I feel like it," replied Marian.

"I think you bear the strain of anxiety wonderfully."

"I am trying to retrieve myself."

"You have retrieved yourself, Miss Vosburgh. You have become a genuine soldier. It didn't take
long to make a veteran of you."

"So much for a good example, you see."

"Oh, well, it's easy enough for a man to face danger. Think how many thousands do it as a matter
of course."

"And must women be timid as a matter of course?"

"Women do not often inspire men as you do, Miss Marian. I know I am different from what I was,
and I think I always shall be different."

"I didn't treat you fairly, Mr. Merwyn, and I've grieved over the past more than I can tell you."

"And you won't mistrust me again?"

"Never."

"You make me very happy, and you will never know how unhappy I have been. Even before I left
the country, last autumn, I envied the drummer-boys of Strahan's regiment. I don't wish to
take advantage of your present feeling, or have you forget that I am still under a miserable
restraint which I can't explain. I must probably resume my old inactive life, while your other
friends win fame and rank in serving their country. Of course I shall give money, but bah!
what's that to a girl like you? When all this hurly-burly in the streets is over, when conventional
life begins again, and I seem a part of it, will you still regard me as a friend?"

His distrust touched her deeply, when she was giving him her heart's best love, and her strong
feeling caused her to falter as she said, "Do you think I can grow cold towards the man who
risked his life for me?"

"That is exaggerated gratitude. Any decent man would risk his life for you. Why, you were as
brave as I. I often ask myself, can you be a friend for my own sake, because of some inherent
congeniality? You have done more for your other friends than they for you, and yet they are
very dear to you, because you esteem them as men. I covet a like personal regard, and I hope
you will teach me to win it"

"You have won it,--that is--"

"That is--? There is a mental reservation, or you are too truthful for undoubted assurance
when shown that gratitude has no place in this relation."

She averted her face from his searching eyes, and was deeply embarrassed.

"I feared it would be so," he said, sadly. "But I do not blame you.  On the contrary I honor
your sincerity. Very well, I shall be heartily glad of any regard that you can give me, and
shall try to be worthy of it."

"Mr. Merwyn," she said, impetuously, "no friend of mine receives a stronger, better, or more
sincere regard than I give you for your own sake. There now, trust me as I trust you;" and
she gave him her hand.

He took it in his strong grasp, but she exclaimed, instantly: "You are feverish. You are ill.
I thought your eyes were unnaturally bright."

"They should be so if it is in the power of happiness to kindle them!"

"Come now," she cried, assuming a little brusqueness of manner which became her well; "I've
given you my word, and that's my bond. If you indulge in any more doubts I'll find a way to
punish you. I'll take my 'affidavy' I'm just as good a friend to you as you are to me. If you
doubt me, I shall doubt you."

"I beg your pardon; no you won't, or cannot, rather. You know well that I have my father's
unchangeable tenacity. It's once and always with me."

"You are speaking riddles," she faltered, averting her face.

"Not at all. I am glad indeed that you can give me simple friendship, unforced, uncompelled
by any other motive than that which actuates you in regard to the others. But you know well--your
most casual glance would reveal it to you--that I, in whom you have inspired some semblance
of manhood, can never dream of any other woman. When you see this truth, as you often will,
you must not punish me for it. You must not try to cure me by coldness or by any other of the
conventional remedies, for you cannot. When we meet, speak kindly, look kindly; and should
it ever be not best or right that we should meet,--that is, often,--we shall not."

"You are scarcely speaking as a friend," she said, in a low voice.

"Will you punish me if I cannot help being far more?"

"No, since you cannot help it," she replied, with a shy laugh.

A new light, a new hope, began to dawn upon him, and he was about to speak impetuously when
Mr. Vosburgh appeared and said, "Merwyn, I've been watching two men who passed and repassed
the house, and who seem to be reconnoitring."

As Merwyn and Marian accompanied him to the parlor they heard the heavy booming of cannon off
on the east side, and it was repeated again and again.

"Those are ominous sounds at this time of night," said Mr. Vosburgh.

"That they don't come from the rioters is a comfort," Merwyn replied; "but it proves what I
said before,--they are becoming more bold and reckless."

"It may also show that the authorities are more stern and relentless in dealing with them."

At last the sounds of conflict died away, the street appeared quiet and deserted, and they
all returned to the dining-room.

The light enabled Merwyn to look eagerly and questioningly at Marian. She smiled, flushed,
and, quickly averting her eyes, began to speak on various topics in a way that warned Merwyn
to restrain all further impatience; but she inspired so strong and delicious a hope that he
could scarcely control himself. He even fancied that there was at times a caressing accent
in her tone when she spoke to him.

"Surely," he thought, "if what I said were repugnant, she would give some hint of the fact;
but how can it be possible that so soon--"

"Come, Marian, I think you may safely retire now," said her father; "I hear Riten coming up."

Even as he spoke, a front parlor window was crashed in. Merwyn and Mr. Vosburgh sprung into
the hall, revolvers in hand; Riten instinctively fled back towards the stairs leading to the
basement, in which she had extinguished the light, and Mr. Vosburgh told his daughter to follow
the servant.

But she stood still, as if paralyzed, and saw a man rushing upon him with a long knife. Mr.
Vosburgh fired, but, from agitation, ineffectually. Merwyn at the same moment had fired on
another man, who fell. A fearful cry escaped from the girl's lips as she saw that her father
was apparently doomed. The gleaming knife was almost above him. Then--how it happened she could
never tell, so swift was the movement--Merwyn stood before her father. The knife descended
upon his breast, yet at the same instant his pistol exploded against the man's temple, and
the miscreant dropped like a log. There were sounds of other men clambering in at the window,
and Mr. Vosburgh snatched Merwyn back by main force, saying to Marian, "Quick! for your life!
down the stairs!"

The moment the door closed upon them all he slid the heavy bolt. Riten stood sobbing at the
foot of the stairs.

"Hush!" said Mr. Vosburgh, sternly. "Each one obey me. Out through the area door instantly."

Across this he also let down a heavy bar, and, taking his daughter's hand, he hurried her to
the fence, removed the boards, and, when all had passed through, replaced them. Mr. Erkmann,
at his neighbor's request, had left his rear basement door open, and was on the watch.  He
appeared almost instantly, and counselled the fugitives to remain with him.

"No," said Mr. Vosburgh; "we will bring no more peril than we must on you. Let us out into
the street at once, and then bar and bolt everything."

"But where can you go at this time?"

"To my house," said Merwyn, firmly. "Please do as Mr. Vosburgh asks.  It will be safest for all."

"Well, since you will have it so."

"Hasten, hasten," Merwyn urged.

Mr. Erkmann unlatched the door and looked out. The street was quiet and deserted, and the fugitives
rushed away with whispered thanks.

"Marian, tie Riten's apron over your head, so as to partially disguise your face," said her father.

Fortunately they met but few people, and no crowds whatever. As they approached Merwyn's home
his steps began to grow unsteady.

"Papa," said Marian, in agitated tones, "Mr. Merwyn is wounded; he wants your support."

"Merciful Heaven, Merwyn! are you wounded?"

"Yes, hasten. I must reach home before giving out."

When they gained his door he had to be almost carried up the steps, and Mr. Vosburgh rang the
bell furiously.

Only a moment or two elapsed before the scared face of Thomas appeared, but as Merwyn crossed
the threshold he fainted.

They carried him to his room, and then Mr. Vosburgh said, "Bring a physician and lose not a
second. Say it is a case of life and death.  Hold! first bring me some brandy."

"Oh, oh!" Marian moaned, "I fear it's death! O papa he gave his life for you."

"No, no," was the hoarse response; "it cannot, shall not be. It's only a wound, and he has
fainted from loss of blood. Show your nerve now. Moisten his lips with brandy. You, Riten,
chafe his wrists with it, while I cut open his shirt and stanch the wound."

A second more and a terrible gash on Merwyn's breast was revealed. How deep it was they could
not know.

Marian held out her handkerchief, and it was first used to stop the flow of blood. When it
was taken away she put it in her bosom.

The old servant, Margy, now rushed in with lamentations.

"Hush!" said Mr. Vosburgh, sternly. "Chafe that other wrist with brandy."

But the swoon was prolonged, and Marian, pallid to her lips, sighed and moaned as she did her
father's bidding.

Thomas was not very long in bringing a good physician, who had often attended the family. Marian
watched his face as if she were to read there a verdict in regard to her own life, and Mr.
Vosburgh evinced scarcely less solicitude.

"His pulse certainly shows great exhaustion; but I cannot yet believe that it is a desperate
case. We must first tally him, and then I will examine his wound. Mr. Vosburgh, lift him up,
and let me see if I cannot make him swallow a little diluted brandy."

At last Merwyn revived somewhat, but did not seem conscious of what was passing around him.
The physician made a hasty examination of the wound and said, "It is not so severe as to be
fatal in itself, but I don't like the hot, dry, feverish condition of his skin."

"He was feverish before he received the wound," said Marian, in a whisper. "I fear he has been
going far beyond his strength."

"I entreat you, sir, not to leave him," said Mr. Vosburgh, "until you can give us more hope."

"Rest assured that I shall not. I am the family physician, and I shall secure for him in the
morning the best surgical aid in the city. All that can be done in these times shall be done.
Hereafter there must be almost absolute quiet, especially when he begins to notice anything.
He must not be moved, or be allowed to move, until I say it is safe. Perhaps if all retire,
except myself and Thomas, he will be less agitated when he recovers consciousness. Margy, you
make good, strong coffee, and get an early breakfast."

They all obeyed his suggestions at once. 

"Clearly, there are two men in England who must be sent into permanent retirement. Depend on it, there
is something fundamentally wrong with them. It is a pity, for they are stuffed with the rarest
of virtues--though I say it, who should not. One of them is Sir Edward
Grey and the other is G.B.S."

Only in France, whose people are making supreme sacrifices, and in Russia, whose factories are
not yet organized for the nation, does industrial peace prevail.

In England the Munitions bill, with its proposals for compulsory arbitration and for limiting profits unweakened,
was passed on July 1st. The bill retained, also, the power for the Government to proclaim the extension
of its strike-stopping authority to other trades than the munitions
trades.

At last Merwyn opened his eyes and asked, feebly: "Where am I? What has happened?"

"You were injured, but are doing well," was the prompt reply. "You know me, Dr. Henderson,
and Thomas is here also. You are in your own room."

"Yes, I see," and he remained silent for some little time; then said, "I remember all now."

"You must keep quiet and try not to think, Mr. Merwyn. Your life depends upon it."

"My mind has a strong disposition to wander."

"The more need of quiet."

"Miss Vosburgh is here. I must see her."

"Yes, by and by."

"Doctor, I fear I am going to be out of my mind. I must see Miss Vosburgh. I will see her;
and if you are wise you will permit me to do so. My life depends upon it more than upon your
skill. Do what I ask, and I will be quiet"

"Very well, then, but the interview must be brief."

"It must be as I say."

Marian was summoned. Hastily drying her eyes, she tried to suppress her strong emotion.

Merwyn feebly reached out his hand to her, and she sat down beside him.

"Do not try to talk," she whispered, taking his hand.

"Yes, I must while I am myself. Dr. Henderson, I love and honor this girl, and would make her
my wife should she consent. I may be dying, but if she is willing to stay with me, it seems
as if I could live through everything, fever and all. If she is willing and you do not permit
her to stay, I want you to know that my blood is on your hands! Marian, are you willing to stay?"

"Yes," she replied; and then, leaning down, she whispered: "I do love you; I have loved you
ever since I understood you. Oh, live for my sake! What would life be now without you?"

"Now you shall stay."

"See, doctor, he is quiet while I am with him," she said, pleadingly.

"And only while you are with me. I know I should die if you were sent away."

"She shall stay with you, Mr. Merwyn, if you obey my orders in other respects. I give you my
word," said Dr. Henderson.

"Very well. Now have patience with me."

"Thomas," whispered the physician, "have the strongest beef tea made, and keep it on hand."

Mr. Vosburgh intercepted the man, and was briefly told what had taken place. "Now there is
a chance for them both," the agitated father muttered, as he restlessly paced the room. "Oh,
how terribly clouded would our lives be, should he die!"

CHAPTER LII.

MOTHER AND SON.

FOR a time Merwyn did keep quiet, but he soon began to mutter brokenly and unintelligibly.
Marian tried to remove her hand to aid the physician a moment, but she felt the feeble tightening
of his clasp, and he cried, "No, no!"

This, for days, was the last sign he gave of intelligent comprehension of what was going on
around him.

"We must humor him as far as we can in safety," the doctor remarked, in a low whisper, and
so began the battle for life.

Day was now dawning, and Thomas was despatched for a very skilful surgeon, who came and gave
the help of long experience.

At last Dr. Henderson joined Mr. Vosburgh in the breakfast-room, and the latter sent a cup
of coffee to his daughter by the physician, who said, when he returned: "I think it would be
well for me to know something about Mr. Merwyn's experience during the past few days. I shall
understand his condition better if I know the causes which led to it."

Mr. Vosburgh told him everything.

"Well," said the doctor, emphatically, "we should do all within human effort to save such a
young fellow."

"I feel that I could give my life to save him," Mr. Vosburgh added.

Hours passed, and Merwyn's delirium became more pronounced. He released his grasp on Marian's
hand, and tossed his arms as if in the deepest trouble, his disordered mind evidently reverting
to the time when life had been so dark and hopeless.

"Chained, chained," he would mutter. "Cruel, unnatural mother, to chain her son like a slave.
My oath is eating out my very heart. SHE despises me as a coward. Oh if she knew what I was
facing!" and such was the burden of all his broken words.

The young girl now learned the secret which had been so long unfathomed. Vainly, with streaming
eyes, she tried at first to reassure him, but the doctor told her it was of no use, the fever
must take its course. Yet her hand upon his brow and cheek often seemed to have a subtle, quieting
spell.

Mr. Vosburgh felt that, whatever happened, he must attend to his duties. Therefore he went
to headquarters and learned that the crisis of the insurrection had passed. The Seventh Regiment
was on duty, and other militia organizations were near at hand.

He also related briefly how he had been driven from his home on the previous night, and was
told that policemen were in charge of the building. Having received a permit to enter it, he
sent his despatch to Washington, also a quieting telegram to his wife, assuring her that all
danger was past.

Then he went to his abandoned home and looked sadly on the havoc that had been made. Nearly
all light articles of value had been carried away, and then, in a spirit of revenge, the rioters
had destroyed and defaced nearly everything. His desk had been broken, but the secret drawer
remained undiscovered. Having obtained his private papers, he left the place, and, as it was
a rented house, resolved that he would not reside there again.

On his return to Merwyn's home, the first one to greet him was Strahan, his face full of the
deepest solicitude.

"I have just arrived," he said. "I first went to your house and was overwhelmed at seeing its
condition; then I drove here and have only learned enough to make me anxious indeed. O my accursed
wound and fever! They kept the fact of the riot from me until this morning, and then I learned
of it almost by accident, and came instantly in spite of them."

"Mr. Strahan, I entreat you to be prudent. I am overwhelmed with trouble and fear for Merwyn,
and I and mine must cause no more mischief. Everything is being done that can be, and all must
be patient and quiet and keep their senses."

"Oh, I'm all right now. As Merwyn's friend, this is my place. Remember what he did for me."

"Very well. If you are equal to it I shall be glad to have you take charge here. As soon as
I have learned of my daughter's and Merwyn's welfare I shall engage rooms at the nearest hotel,
and, if the city remains quiet, telegraph for my wife;" and he sent Thomas to Dr.  Henderson
with a request to see him.

"No special change, and there cannot be very soon," reported the physician.

"But my daughter--she must not be allowed to go beyond her strength."

"I will look after her as carefully as after my other patient," was the reassuring reply.

"It's a strange story, Mr. Strahan," resumed Mr. Vosburgh, when they were alone. "You are undoubtedly
surprised that my daughter should be one of Merwyn's watchers. He saved my life last night,
and my daughter and home the night before. They are virtually engaged."

"Oh that I had been here!" groaned Strahan.

"Under the circumstances it was well that you were not. It would probably have cost you your
life. Only the strongest and soundest men could endure the strain. Merwyn came to our assistance
from the first;" and he told the young officer enough of what had occurred to make it all intelligible
to him.

Strahan drew a long breath, then said: "He has won her fairly. I had suspected his regard for
her; but I would rather have had his opportunity and his wound than be a major-general."

"I appreciate the honor you pay my daughter, but there are some matters beyond human control,"
was the kind response.

"I understand all that," said the young man, sadly; "but I can still be her loyal friend, and
that, probably, is all that I ever could have been."

"I, at least, can assure you of our very highest esteem and respect, Mr. Strahan;" and after
a few more words the gentlemen parted.

The hours dragged on, and at last Dr. Henderson insisted that Marian should go down to lunch.
She first met Strahan in the sitting-room, and sobbed on his shoulder: "O Arthur! I fear he
will die, and if he does I shall wish to die, too. You must stand by us both like a loyal brother."

"Marian, I will," he faltered; and he kept his word.

He made her take food, and at last inspired her with something of his own sanguine spirit.

"Oh, what a comfort it is to have you here!" she said, as she was returning to her post. "You
make despair impossible."

Again the hours dragged slowly on, the stillness of the house broken only by Merwyn's delirious
words. Then, for a time, there was disquiet in bitter truth. 

A proposed method is by schools of domestic arts, but, valuable as these are, they are but subsidiary
aids to the establishment of homes; for real homes are primarily
centers of ideals and teaching and only incidentally centers of cooking.

The restoration and raising of home ideals must, then, come from social
life among Negroes themselves; and does that social life need no
leadership?

It needs the best possible leadership of pure hearts and trained heads, the highest leadership
of carefully trained men.

Such are the arguments for the Negro college, and such is the work that
Atlanta University and a few similar institutions seek to do. We believe
that a rationally arranged college course of study for men and women
able to pursue it is the best and only method of putting into the world
Negroes with ability to use the social forces of their race so as to
stamp out crime, strengthen the home, eliminate degenerates, and
inspire and encourage the higher tendencies of the race not only in
thought and aspiration but in every-day toil.

And we believe this, not simply because we have argued that such training ought to have these effects,
or merely because we hope for such results in some dim future, but because already for years
we have seen in the work of our graduates precisely such results as I
have mentioned: successful teachers of teachers, intelligent and
upright ministers, skilled physicians, principals of industrial schools,
business men, and above all, makers of model homes and leaders of
social groups, out from which radiate subtle but tangible forces of
uplift and inspiration.

The proof of this lies scattered in every State of the South, and,
above all, in the half-unwilling testimony of men disposed to decry
our work.

Between the Negro college and industrial school there are the strongest
grounds for co-operation and unity.

It is not a matter of mere emphasis, for we would be glad to see ten industrial schools
to every college.

It is not a fact that there are to-day too few Negro colleges, but
rather that there are too many institutions attempting to do college
work. But the danger lies in the fact that the best of the Negro colleges
are poorly equipped and are to-day losing support and countenance,
and that, unless the nation awakens to its duty, ten years will see
the annihilation of higher Negro training in the South.

We need a few strong, well-equipped Negro colleges, and we need them
now, not to-morrow; unless we can have them and have them decently
supported, Negro education in the South, both common-school and industrial,
is doomed to failure, and the forces of social regeneration will be
fatally weakened, for the college to-day among Negroes is, just as
truly as it was yesterday among whites, the beginning and not the
end of human training, the foundation and not the cap-stone of popular
education.

Strange is it not, my brothers, how often in America those great
watchwords of human energy--"Be strong!" "Know thyself!" Your son--"

Her mind was prepared for but one great disaster, and, her self-control at last giving way,
she almost shrieked, "What! has he taken arms against the South?"

"Mrs. Merwyn," replied Strahan, "is that the worst that could happen?"

A sudden and terrible dread smote the proud woman, and she sunk into a chair, while young Estelle
Merwyn rushed upon Strahan, and, seizing his hand, faltered in a whisper, "Is--is--" but she
could proceed no further.

"No; but he soon will be unless reason and affection control your actions and words. Your family
physician is here, Mrs. Merwyn, and I trust you will be guided by his counsel."

"Send him to me," gasped the mother.

Dr. Henderson soon came and explained in part what had occurred.

"Oh, those Vosburghs!" exclaimed Mrs. Merwyn, with a gesture of unspeakable revolt at the state
of affairs. "Well," she added, with a stern face, "it is my place and not a stranger's to be
at my son's side."

"Pardon me, madam; you cannot go to your son at all in your present mood. In an emergency like
this a physician is autocrat, and your son's life hangs by a hair."

"Who has a better right--who can do more for a child than a mother?"

"That should be true, but--" and he hesitated in embarrassment, for a moment, then concluded,
firmly: "Your son is not expecting you, and agitation now might be fatal to him. There are
other reasons which you will soon understand."

"There is one thing I already understand,--a nameless stranger is with him, and I am kept away."

"Miss Vosburgh is not a nameless stranger," said Strahan; "and she is affianced to your son."

"O Heaven! I shall go mad!" the lady groaned, a tempest of conflicting emotions sweeping through
her heart.

"Come, Mrs. Merwyn," said Dr. Henderson, kindly, yet firmly, "take the counsel of an old friend.
Distracted as you naturally are with all these unexpected and terrible events, you must recognize
the truth that you are in no condition to take upon you the care of your son now. He would
not know you, I fear, yet your voice might agitate him fatally. I do not forbid you to see
him, but I do forbid that you should speak to him now, and I shall not answer for the consequences
if you do."

"Mamma, mamma, you must be patient and do as Dr. Henderson advises," cried Estelle. "When you
are calm you will see that he is right. If anything should happen you would never forgive yourself."

The mother's bitter protest was passing into a deadlier fear, but she only said, coldly, "Very
well; since such are your decrees I shall go to my room and wait till I am summoned;" and she
rose and left the apartment, followed by her elder daughter, a silent, reticent girl, whose
spirit her mother had apparently quenched.

Estelle lingered until they had gone, and then she turned to Strahan, who said, with an attempt
at a smile, "I can scarcely realize that this is the little girl whom I used to play with and
tease."

But she heeded not his words. Her large, lustrous eyes were dim with tears, as she asked, falteringly,
"Tell me the truth, Mr. Strahan; do you think my brother is very ill?"

"Yes," he replied, sadly; "and I hope I may be permitted to remain as one of his watchers.
He took care of me, last winter, in an almost mortal illness, and I would gladly do him a like
service."

"But you are hurt. Your arm is in a sling."

"My wound is healing, and I could sit by your brother's side as well as elsewhere."

"You shall remain," said the girl, emphatically. "I have some of mamma's spirit, if not all
her prejudices. Is this Miss Vosburgh such a fright?"

"I regard her as the noblest and most beautiful girl I ever saw."

"Oh, you do?"

"Yes."

"Well, I shall go and talk reason to mamma, for sister Berta yields to everything without a
word. You must stay, and I shall do my share of watching as soon as the doctor permits."

Mrs. Merwyn thought she would remain in her room as she had said, but the fountains of the
great deep in her soul were breaking up.  She found that the mother in her heart was stronger
than the partisan. She MUST see her son.

At last she sent Thomas for Dr. Henderson again, and obtained permission to look upon her child.
Bitter as the physician knew the experience would be, it might be salutary. With noiseless
tread she crossed the threshold, and saw Marian's pure, pale profile; she drew a few steps
nearer; the young girl turned and bowed gravely, then resumed her watch.

For the moment Merwyn was silent, then in a voice all too distinct he said: "Cruel, unnatural
mother, to rob me of my manhood, to chain me like one of her slaves. Jeff Davis and empire
are more to her than husband or son."

The conscience-stricken woman covered her face with her hands and glided away. As by a lightning-flash
the reason why she had forfeited her place by the couch of her son was revealed.

CHAPTER LIII.

"MISSY S'WANEE."

THERE is no need of dwelling long on subsequent events. Our story has already indicated many
of them. Mrs. Merwyn's bitter lesson was emphasized through many weary days. She hovered about
her son like a remorseful spirit, but dared not speak to him. She had learned too well why
her voice might cause fatal agitation. For a time she tried to ignore Marian, but the girl's
gentle dignity and profound sorrow, her untiring faithfulness, conquered pride at last, and
the mother, with trembling lips, asked forgiveness and besought affection.

Blauvelt arrived in town on the evening of the day just described, proposing to offer his services
to the city authorities, meanwhile cherishing the secret hope that he might serve Marian. He
at last found Strahan at Merwyn's home. The brother officers talked long and earnestly, but,
while both were reticent concerning their deeper thoughts, they both knew that a secret dream
was over forever.

Marian came down and gave her hand to the artist soldier in warm pressure as she said, "My
friends are loyal in my time of need."

He lingered a day or two in the city, satisfied himself that the insurrection was over, then
went home, bade his old mother good-by, and joined his regiment. He was soon transferred to
the staff of a general officer, and served with honor and distinction to the end of the war.

Mrs. Vosburgh joined her husband; and the awful peril through which he and her daughter had
passed awakened in her a deeper sense of real life. In contemplation of the immeasurable loss
which she might have sustained she learned to value better what she possessed. By Estelle's
tact it was arranged that she could often see Marian without embarrassment. So far as her nature
permitted she shared in her husband's boundless solicitude for Merwyn.

Warm-hearted Estelle was soon conscious of a sister's affection for the girl of her brother's
choice, and shared her vigils. She became also a very good friend to Strahan, and entertained
a secret admiration for him, well hidden, however, by a brusque, yet delicate raillery.

But Strahan believed that the romance of his life was over, and he eventually joined his regiment
with some reckless hopes of "stopping a bullet" as he phrased it. Gloomy cynicism, however,
was not his forte; and when, before the year was out, he was again promoted, he found that
life was anything but a burden, although he was so ready to risk it.

At last the light of reason dawned in Merwyn's eyes. He recognized Marian, smiled, and fell
into a quiet sleep. On awakening, he said to her: "You kept your word, my darling. You did
not leave me. I should have died if you had. I think I never wholly lost the consciousness
that you were near me."

The young girl soon brought about a complete reconciliation between mother and son, and Merwyn
was absolved from his oath. Even as a devoted husband, which he became at Christmas-tide, she
found him too ready to go to the front. He appeared, however, to have little ambition for distinction,
and was satisfied to enter upon duty in a very subordinate position; but he did it so well
and bravely that his fine abilities were recognized, and he was advanced. At last, to his mother's
horror, he received a colonel's commission to a colored regiment.

Many of Mrs. Merwyn's lifelong prejudices were never overcome, and she remained loyal to the
South; but she was taught that mother-love is the mightiest of human forces, and at last admitted
that her son, as a man, had a right to choose and act for himself.

Mr. Vosburgh remained in the city as the trusted agent of the government until the close of
the war, and was then transferred to Washington. Every year cemented his friendship with Merwyn,
and the two men corresponded so faithfully that Marian declared she was jealous. Each knew,
however, that their mutual regard and good-comradeship were among her deepest sources of happiness.
While her husband was absent Marian made the country house on the Hudson her residence, but
in many ways she sought opportunity to reduce the awful sum of anguish entailed by the war.
She often lured Estelle from the city as her companion, even in bleak wintry weather. Here
Strahan found her when on a leave of absence in the last year of the war, and he soon learned
that he had another heart to lose. Marian was discreetly blind to his direct and soldier-like
siege. Indeed, she proved the best of allies, aware that the young officer's time was limited.

Estelle was elusive as a mocking spirit of the air, until the last day of his leave was expiring,
and then laughingly admitted that she had surrendered almost two years before.

Of the humble characters in my story it is sufficient to say that Zeb barely survived, and
was helpless for life. Pensions from Merwyn and Lane secured for him and his mother every comfort.
Barney Ghegan eventually recovered, and resumed his duties on the police force.

He often said, "Oi'm proud to wear the uniform that Misther Merwyn honored."

I have now only to outline the fortunes of Captain Lane and "Missy S'wanee," and then to take
leave of my reader, supposing that he has had the patience to accompany me thus far.

Lane's wound, reopened by his exertions in escaping to Washington, kept him helpless on a bed
of suffering during the riots and for weeks thereafter. Then he was granted a long furlough,
which he spent chiefly with his family at the North. Like Strahan he felt that Merwyn had won
Marian fairly. So far was he from cherishing any bitterness, that he received the successful
rival within the circle of his nearest friends. By being sincere, true to nature and conscience,
Marian retained, not only the friendship and respect of her lovers, but also her ennobling
influence over them. While they saw that Merwyn was supreme, they also learned that they would
never be dismissed with indifference from her thoughts,--that she would follow them through
life with an affectionate interest and good-will scarcely less than she would bestow on brothers
cradled in the same home with herself. Lane, with his steadfast nature, would maintain this
relation more closely than the others, but the reader has already guessed that he would seek
to give and to find consolation elsewhere. Suwanee Barkdale had awakened his strongest sympathy
and respect, and the haunting thought that she, like himself, had given her love apparently
where it could not be returned, made her seem akin to himself in the deepest and saddest experience.
Gradually and almost unconsciously he gave his thoughts to her, and began to wonder when and
how they should meet again, if ever. He wrote to her several times, but obtained no answer,
no assurance that his letters were received. When he was fit for duty again his regiment was
in the West, and it remained there until the close of the war, he having eventually attained
to its command.

As soon as he could control his own movements he resolved to settle one question before he
resumed the quiet pursuit of his profession,--he would learn the fate of "Missy S'wanee." Securing
a strong, fleet horse, he left Washington, and rode rapidly through a region that had been
trampled almost into a desert by the iron heel of war. The May sun was low in the west when
he turned from the road into the extended lawn which led up to the Barkdale mansion. Little
beyond unsightly stumps was left of the beautiful groves by which it had been bordered.

Vividly his memory reproduced the same hour, now years since, when he had ridden up that lawn
at the head of his troopers, his sabre flashing in the last rays of the sun. It seemed ages
ago, so much had happened; but through all the changes and perils the low sob of the Southern
girl when she opened the way for his escape had been vibrating in stronger and tenderer chords
in the depths of his soul. It had awakened dreams and imaginings which, if dissipated, would
leave but a busy, practical life as devoid of romance as the law-tomes to which he would give
his thoughts. It was natural, therefore, that his heart should beat fast as he approached the
solution of a question bearing so vitally on all his future.

He concealed himself and his horse behind some low, shrubby trees that had been too insignificant
for the camp fires, long since burned out, and scanned the battered dwelling. No sign of life
was visible. He was about to proceed and end his suspense at once, when a lady, clad in mourning,
came out and sat down on the veranda. He instantly recognized Suwanee.

For a few moments Lane could scarcely summon courage to approach. The surrounding desolation,
her badges of bereavement and sorrow, gave the young girl the dignity and sacredness of immeasurable
misfortune. She who had once so abounded in joyous, spirited life now seemed emblematical of
her own war-wasted and unhappy land,--one to whom the past and the dead were more than the
future and the living.

Would she receive him? Would she forgive him, one of the authors of her people's bleeding wounds?
He determined to end his suspense, and rode slowly towards her, that she might not be startled.

At first she did not recognize the stranger in civilian dress, who was still more disguised
by a heavy beard; but she rose and approached the veranda steps to meet him. He was about to
speak, when she gave a great start, and a quick flush passed over her face. 

Remember, the plainest food, the most easily digested, the most nourishing is what you must have.
Believe me, you will be rewarded for the temperate use you make of
all the dainties you see, by a clear complexion, and good color,
which will make you "good to look at," especially good for a sick
person to look at.

As to the nurse's night toilette, it is quite a problem sometimes as
to just what is best to wear.

When the patient is not ill enough for the uniform to be retained for
night duty, the nurse should be comfortable enough so that she can
sleep; yet dressed enough for any emergency. I think a house gown
of pretty material much neater than the kimono.

Be sure this fits about the shoulders, and never have loose flowing sleeves.
A white frill in the neck looks very trim, and is always becoming.

The corset and all tight clothes should be removed, stockings and underwear kept on. The hair should
be arranged simply, but not allowed to hang in a loose braid, unless
you are very sure you will not see any but the patient, and even then
it may be unwise, as a braid of hair has an exasperating way of slipping
from its proper place (hanging down the back) and dipping into whatever
you are stooping over.

Dressed thus, with night shoes to protect the feet, one can lie down
on a lounge and sleep very comfortably, being freed from tight clothes,
and yet being entirely presentable, no matter what happens. And you,--you have been so busy in helping those who caused these woes that you
evidently forgot the once light-hearted girl whom you first saw on this veranda. Why speak
of friendship, Captain Lane, when rivers of blood flow between us,--rivers fed from the veins
of my kindred?"

Her words were so stern and sad that Lane sat down on the steps at her feet and buried his
face in his hands. His hope was withering and his tongue paralyzed in the presence of such
grief as hers.

She softened a little as she looked down upon him, and after a moment or two resumed: "I do
not blame you personally. I must try to be just in my bitter sorrow and despair. You proved
long ago that you were obeying your conscience; but you who conquer cannot know the hearts
of the conquered. Your home does not look like mine; your kindred are waiting to welcome you
with plaudits. You have everything to live for,--honor, prosperity, and love; for doubtless,
long before this, the cold-hearted Northern girl has been won by the fame of your achievements.
Think of me as a ghost, doomed to haunt these desolate scenes where once I was happy."

"No," he replied, springing to his feet, "I shall think of you as the woman I love. Life shall
not end so unhappily for us both; for if you persist in your morbid enmity, my future will
be as wretched as yours. You judge me unheard, and you wrong me cruelly. I have never forgotten
you for an hour. I wrote to you again and again, and received no answer. The moment I was released
from the iron rule of military duty in the West I sought you before returning to the mother
who bore me. No river of blood flows between us that my love could not bridge. I admit that
I was speechless at first before the magnitude of your sorrows; but must this accursed war
go on forever, blighting life and hope? What was the wound you did so much towards healing
compared to the one you are giving me now? Many a blow has been aimed at me, but not one has
pierced my heart before."

She tried to listen rigidly and coldly to his impassioned utterance, but could not, and, as
he ceased, she was sobbing in her chair. He sought with gentle words to soothe her, but by
a gesture she silenced him.

At last she said, brokenly: "For months I have not shed a tear. My heart and brain seemed bursting,
yet I could get no relief. Were it not for some faith and hope in God, I should have followed
my kindred. You cannot know, you never can know."

"I know one thing, Suwanee. You were once a brave, unselfish woman. I will not, I cannot believe
that you have parted with your noble, generous impulses. You may remain cold to me if I merely
plead my cause for your sake, that I may bring consolation and healing into your life; but
I still have too much faith in your large, warm, Southern heart to believe that you will blight
my life also. If you can never love me, give me the right to be your loyal and helpful friend.
Giving you all that is best and most sacred in my nature how can you send me away as if I had
no part or lot in your life? It is not, cannot be true. When I honor you and would give my
life for you, and shall love you all my days, it is absurd to say that I am nothing to you.
Only embodied selfishness and callousness could say that. You may not be able to give what
I do, but you should give all you can. 'Rivers of blood flowing between us' is morbid nonsense.
Forgive me that I speak strongly,--I feel strongly. My soul is in my words. I felt towards
my cause as you towards yours, and had I not acted as I have, you would be the first to think
me a craven. But what has all this to do with the sacred instinct, the pure, unbounded love
which compels me to seek you as my wife?"

"You have spoken such words to another," she said, in a low tone.

"No, never such words as I speak to you. I could not have spoken them, for then I was too young
and immature to feel them. I did love Miss Vosburgh as sincerely as I now respect and esteem
her. She is the happy wife of another man. I speak to you from the depths of my matured manhood.
What is more I speak with the solemnity and truth which your sorrows should inspire. Should
you refuse my hand it will never be offered to another, and you know me well enough to be sure
I will keep my word."

"Oh, can it be right?" cried the girl, wringing her hands.

"One question will settle all: Can you return my love?"

With that query light came into her mind as if from heaven. She saw that such love as theirs
was the supreme motive, the supreme obligation.

She rose and fixed her lovely, tear-gemmed eyes upon him searchingly as she asked, "Would you
wed me, a beggar, dowered only with sorrow and bitter memories?"

"I will wed you, Suwanee Barkdale, or no one."

"There," she said, with a wan smile, holding out her hand; "the North has conquered again." 

And then it came into my mind, I know not bow, to call upon Elias,
and at the same moment I saw the sun rising in the heavens; and while
I cried out Elias with all my might, behold! the splendor of the sun
was shed upon me, and immediately shook from me all heaviness. Still more, never imagine that I shall chide you, even in my thoughts,
for love of your kindred and people, or the belief that they honestly and heroically did what
seemed to them their duty. When you thought yourself such a hopeless little sinner, and I discovered
you to be a saint, did I not admit that your patriotic impulses were as sincere as my own?
As it has often been in the past, time will settle all questions between your people and ours,
and time and a better knowledge of each other will heal our mutual wounds. I wish to remove
fear and distrust of the immediate future from your mind, however. I must take you to a Northern
home, where I can work for you in my profession, but you can be your own true self there,--just
what you were when you first won my honor and esteem. The memory of your brave father and brothers
shall be sacred to me as well as to you. I shall expect you to change your feelings and opinions
under no other compulsion than that of your own reason and conscience. Shall you fear to go
with me now? This Society also did a considerable work for the freedmen--and the white refugees,
in connection with the Western Sanitary Commission. On the formation
of the Freedmen's Relief Society, this part of their work was transferred
to them. O Fenton, I loved you unsought, and
the truth nearly killed me at first, but I came at last to be a little proud of it. You were
so brave, yet considerate, so fair and generous towards us, that you banished my prejudices,
and you won my heart by believing there was some good in it after all."

A white shock of wool surmounting a wrinkled, ebon visage appeared at the door, and the old
cook said, "Missy S'wanee, dere's nuffin' in de house for supper but a little cawn-meal. Oh,
bress de Lawd! if dere ain't Cap'n Lane!"

"Give us a hoe-cake, then," cried Lane, shaking the old woman's hand. "I'd rather sup with
your mistress to-night on corn-meal than sit down to the grandest banquet you have ever prepared
in the past. In the morning I'll forage for breakfast."

"Bress de Lawd!" said the old woman, as she hobbled away. "Good times comin' now. If I could
jes' hear Missy S'wanee larf once mo';" and then she passed beyond hearing.

"Yes, Suwanee, if I could only hear your old sweet laugh once more!" Lane pleaded.

"Not yet, Fenton; not yet,--some day."

THE END
