The Battle of Spring Hill, Tennessee.

PREPARED BY Companion Captain John K. Shellenberger

READ AFTER THE STATED MEETING HELD FEBRUARY 2d, 1907

PREFACE.

More than twenty-five years have passed since I began to collect the materials from which this
pamphlet has been evolved. As a substantial basis, to begin with, I was an eye-witness of all
the fighting in the vicinity of Spring Hill, that amounted to anything, from the time Forrest
attacked the 64th Ohio on the skirmish line until Cleburne's Division recoiled from the fire
of the battery posted at the village.

Since I began collecting I have neglected no opportunity to increase my stock of information
by conversation, reading or correspondence. I have twice revisited the battlefield. I have
the Government volume containing the official reports, all of which I have carefully studied.
Among my correspondents, on the Union side, have been Generals Stanley, Wilson, Opdycke, Lane
and Bradley, besides many others of lesser rank. I am as confident, from their letters, that
my paper would have the approval of those named, who are now dead, as I am sure it has the
approval of General Wilson, to whom a manuscript copy was submitted for criticism.

Among other Confederates, I wrote to General S.D. Lee, who referred me to Judge J.P. Young,
of Memphis Tennessee, with the statement that he had exhausted the subject on the Confederate
side. He was present at Spring Hill as a boy soldier in Forrest's cavalry, and for years has
been engaged in writing a history of the Confederate Army of Tennessee, to which he has given
an enormous amount of careful research. To him I am indebted for much of the most valuable
part of my information concerning the Confederate troops. From the materials thus gathered
I have tried to give, within the compass of a Loyal Legion paper, a clear and truthful account
of the affair just as it happened. That opinions will differ, is shown by the fact that Judge
Young holds General Brown responsible for the Confederate failure, while I believe that Cheatham,
Stewart and Bate were all greater sinners than Brown. He was acting under the eye of Cheatham,
who could easily have forced an attack by Brown's Division if he had been equal to the occasion.

By a curious coincidence General Lee was present as the guest of the Missouri Commandery at
the meeting when the paper was read, and, in commenting on it, General Lee stated that I had
told the truth about as it had occurred. The deductions made from the facts stated are my own.

THE BATTLE OF SPRING HILL.

It may be fairly claimed that the success of General Sherman's famous March to the Sea hung
on the issue of a minor battle fought at Spring Hill, in Middle Tennessee, the evening of November
29th, 1864, when Sherman and his army were hundreds of miles away in the heart of Georgia.
It will be remembered that when Sherman started from Atlanta for Savannah his old antagonist,
General Hood, was at Florence, Alabama, refitting his army to the limit of the waning resources
of the Confederacy, for an aggressive campaign into Tennessee. If Hood's campaign had proved
successful Sherman's unopposed march through Georgia would have been derided as a crazy freak,
and, no doubt, the old charge of insanity would have been revived against him. By how narrow
a margin Hood missed a brilliant success, a truthful account of the Spring Hill affair will
disclose. Much has been written by interested generals of both sides, and by their partisan
friends, to mislead as to the real situation. With no personal friendships or enmities to subserve,
it is the intention of this paper to tell the truth without any regard to its effect on the
reputation of any general, Federal or Confederate.

The Administration gave a reluctant consent to Sherman's plan on the condition that he would
leave with General Thomas, commanding in Tennessee, a force strong enough to defeat Hood. On
paper Thomas had plenty of men, but Sherman had taken his pick of infantry, cavalry, artillery
and transportation, leaving the odds and ends with Thomas, consisting largely of post troops
garrisoning towns; bridge guards in block-houses along the railroads; new regiments recruited
by the payment of the big bounties that produced the infamous tribe of bounty jumpers; negro
regiments never yet tested in battle; green drafted men assigned to some of the old, depleted
regiments in such large numbers as to change their veteran character; dismounted cavalrymen
sent back to get horses, and convalescents and furloughed men belonging to the army with Sherman
who had come up too late to join their commands, organized into temporary companies and regiments.

Moreover, Thomas' forces were scattered from East Tennessee to Central Missouri, where General
A.J. Smith, with two divisions of the Sixteenth corps, was marching for St. Louis to take steamboats
to join Thomas at Nashville. The only force available for immediate field service consisted
of the Fourth and the Twenty-third corps, the two weakest corps of Sherman's army, which he
had sent back to Thomas. These two corps, temporarily commanded by General Schofield, were
thrown well forward towards Florence to delay Hood long enough for Thomas to concentrate and
organize from his widely scattered resources a force strong enough to give battle to Hood.

Passing over all prior operations we will take up the situation as it was the morning of November
29th. General Schofield had then well in hand on the north bank of Duck River, opposite Columbia,
Tennessee, the divisions of Kimball, Wagner and Wood, composing the Fourth corps, and of Cox
and Ruger, of the Twenty-third corps, Ruger's lacking one brigade on detached service. Across
the river were two divisions of General S. D. Lee's corps of Hood's Army. The preceding evening
Hood, himself, with the corps of Cheatham and Stewart, and Johnson's division of Lee's corps,
had moved up the river five and one-half miles to Davis' ford, where he was laying his pontoons
preparatory to crossing. His plan was to detain Schofield at the river by feinting with two
divisions while he would lead seven divisions past the left flank and plant them across Schofield's
line of retreat at Spring Hill, twelve miles north of Duck River. As Hood greatly outnumbered
Schofield, his plan contemplated the destruction of Schofield's army.

During the evening of the 28th General Wilson, commanding our cavalry, had learned enough of
Hood's movement to divine its purpose. In view of its vital importance, to insure a delivery,
he sent a message in triplicate, each courier riding by a separate road, informing Schofield
of what Hood was doing, and advising and urging him to get back to Spring Hill with all his
army by 10 o'clock, the 29th. General Wilson has stated that his couriers all got through,
the one riding by the shortest road reaching Schofield's headquarters at 3 a.m. of the 29th.

From the reports sent him by Wilson, General Thomas at Nashville had also correctly divined
Hood's intention, and in a dispatch dated at 3:30 a.m., of the 29th--but by the neglect of
the night operator not transmitted until 6 o'clock, when the day operator came on duty--he
ordered Schofield to fall back to Franklin, leaving a sufficient force at Spring Hill to delay
Hood until he was securely posted at Franklin.

I was commanding Company B, 64th Ohio Regiment, Bradley's brigade, Wagner's division. The brigade
was under arms that morning by 4 o'clock, and had orders to be ready to march on a moment's
notice. It is assumed that all the rest of the army received the same orders, and that this
action was taken on account of the information brought by Wilson's courier at 3 o'clock. But
nothing was done until 8 o'clock, when the movements began which disposed of our army as follows:

Wagner's division was sent to Spring Hill to guard the reserve artillery and the wagon trains,
all ordered to Spring Hill, from any raid by Hood's cavalry. General Stanley, the corps commander,
went with Wagner. Cox's division was posted along the river, and was engaged all day in skirmishing
with the two divisions under Lee, which kept up a noisy demonstration of forcing a crossing.
Ruger's two brigades were posted four miles north of Duck river, where the pike to Spring Hill
crosses Rutherford's creek, to hold that crossing. The divisions of Kimball and Wood were aligned
between Cox and Ruger, facing up the river towards Hood's crossing. At 9 o'clock Post's brigade,
of Wood's division, was sent up the river to reconnoiter, and before 11 o'clock Post had reached
a position where he could see Hood's column marching towards Spring Hill, and repeatedly reported
that fact.

Nevertheless none of the four divisions near Duck river were started for Spring Hill until
after 4 o'clock, when Schofield had heard from Stanley that Hood was attacking at Spring Hill.
When, two months later, Schofield was in Washington, where they knew nothing about the details
of the campaign, he so successfully impressed his claim on the Administration that he was given
the same promotion with which General Sheridan had been rewarded for the victory at Winchester,
jumping at one bound from the rank of captain to that of brigadier-general in the regular army.
But it is plain that after five hours' of deliberation that morning Schofield had reached a
wrong conclusion as to Hood's intention, for if "Actions speak louder than words," there can
be no question that Schofield's dispositions were made under the conviction that Hood would
march down the river, after crossing, to clear the way for Lee to cross. And so deeply infatuated
was he with this self-imposed delusion that, disregarding the order of Thomas and the advice
of Wilson, he cherished it for about five hours after Post had reported that Hood was marching
towards Spring Hill.

Wagner's advance, double-quicking through Spring Hill at noon, and deploying just beyond on
a run, interposed barely in time to head off the advance of Hood's cavalry, Wagner arriving
by the Columbia pike from the southwest and the cavalry by the Mount Carmel road from the east.
General Forrest, commanding Hood's cavalry, had used his superior numbers so skillfully as
to push back Wilson with our cavalry just north of Mount Carmel, which is five miles east of
Spring Hill, before noon. Leaving one brigade to watch Wilson, Forrest then crossed over to
Spring Hill with all the rest of his three divisions of cavalry. If Wagner had arrived a few
minutes later he would have found Forrest in possession at Spring Hill.

General Cox, in his book on this campaign, claims that General Wilson committed a grave error
in not crossing over to Spring Hill, in advance of Forrest, with all our cavalry. But in justice
to Wilson it must be remembered that at Mount Carmel he acted under the belief that Schofield
was following the advice he had given early that morning. If Schofield had been at Spring Hill
at 10 o'clock, as Wilson had advised, with all his infantry, what reason could there have been
for the cavalry joining him there?

When Bradley's brigade, the rear of Wagner's column, was nearing Spring Hill some of the cavalry
approached the pike through the fields to reconnoiter, and the 64th Ohio was sent to drive
them away. With the right wing deployed as skirmishers and the left wing in reserve, the regiment
advanced steadily, driving before it the cavalry, without replying to the harmless long-range
fire they kept up with their carbines, but always galloping away before we could get within
effective range. About a mile east of the pike we crossed the Rally Hill road. This was the
road by which Hood's infantry column approached. It there runs north nearly parallel with the
pike to a point 500 yards east of Spring Hill, where it turns west to enter the village. Leaving
one of the reserve companies to watch the road, the rest of the regiment kept on in pursuit
of the cavalry until our skirmishers were abreast of the Caldwell house, about 800 yards east
of the road, when a halt was called. A few minutes later, at 2:30 o'clock, the left of our
skirmish line, north of the Caldwell house, was attacked by a line of battle in front while
the cavalry worked around our left flank. At the time we believed the battle line to be a part
of Hood's infantry, and in a letter from General Bradley he states that it caused great consternation
at headquarters in Spring Hill when Major Coulter, of the 64th, came galloping back with the
information that the regiment was fighting with infantry. But investigation has disclosed that
the battle line was composed of mounted infantry belonging to Forrest's command. They were
armed with Enfield rifles, and always fought on foot like ordinary infantry, using their horses
for traveling rapidly from place to place.

The four reserve companies were thrown in on a run at the point of contact, but our line was
soon forced to fall back by the cavalry turning our left flank, where they cut off and captured
three of our skirmishers. One of the three was badly wounded that evening in trying to escape,
a bullet entering from behind and passing through his mouth in a way to knock out nearly one-half
of all his teeth. We found him in a hospital at Spring Hill when passing through in pursuit
of Hood's army after the victory at Nashville. In relating his experience he stated that when
they were captured they were taken before some general, name unknown to him, who questioned
them closely as to what force was holding Spring Hill. The general was probably Forrest, for
he was personally directing the attack on the 64th, but may have been Hood himself, for he
was on the Rally Hill road, less than a mile away, soon after the men were captured. They all
declared that they knew the Fourth corps was at Spring Hill, and they believed all the rest
of the army. Their declaration must have carried greater weight on account of their own faith
in what they were telling, for at that time the whole regiment believed that all the rest of
the army had followed to Spring Hill close on the heels of Wagner's division.

Eventually the 64th was driven back across the Rally Hill road, where a last stand was made
in a large woods covering a broad ridge abutting on the road about three-fourths of a mile
southeast of Spring Hill. While in these woods, occurred a bit of exciting personal experience.
A bullet, coming from the right, passed through my overcoat, buttoned up to my chin, in a way
to take along the top button of my blouse underneath the coat. That big brass button struck
me a stinging blow on the point of the left collar-bone, and, clasping both hands to the spot,
I commenced feeling for the hole with my finger tips, fully convinced that a bullet coming
from the front had gone through me there and had inflicted a serious and possibly a mortal
wound. It was not until I had opened the coat for a closer investigation that I found I was
worse scared than hurt. Some of the enemy had secured a position on our right flank, where
they opened an enfilading fire, and it was one of their bullets that had hit me. To get out
of that fire the regiment fell back towards the interior of the woods, where it was so close
to our main line that it was called in.

It was then about 3:30 o'clock, and by that time the situation of our army had become so critical
that nothing short of the grossest blundering on the part of the enemy could save it from a
great disaster, and there was a fine possibility for destroying it.

Wagner's division had so much property to protect that it was stretched out on a line extending
from the railway station, nearly a mile northwest of Spring Hill, where two trains of cars
were standing on the track, around by the north, east and south, to the Columbia pike on the
southwest. Behind this long line the village streets and the adjacent fields were crammed with
nearly everything on wheels belonging to our army--ambulances, artillery carriages and army
wagons to the number of about 800 vehicles. The nearest support was Ruger's two brigades, eight
miles away, and it was about an hour later before Ruger had started for Spring Hill. Opdycke's
brigade was covering the railway station and the Franklin pike on the north, and Lane's brigade
the Mount Carmel road on the east. They had a connected line, but it was so long that much
of it consisted of skirmishers only. They had in their front detachments of Forrest's cavalry
feeling along their line for an opening to get at the trains. Bradley's brigade occupied an
advanced, detached position, on the ridge to the southeast that has been mentioned, to cover
the approach by the Rally Hill road. There was a gap of half a mile between Lane's right in
front of Spring Hill and Bradley's left, out on the ridge. Bradley had in his immediate front
the main body of Forrest's three divisions of cavalry and the three divisions of infantry composing
Cheatham's corps, while four more divisions of infantry were within easy supporting distance.
In brief, ten of the twelve divisions, cavalry included, composing Hood's army, were in front
of Spring Hill, and at 4 o'clock Hood was attacking with his infantry Wagner's lone division,
guarding all our trains, while Schofield was still waiting for Hood at Duck river with four
divisions from eight to twelve miles away. If Wagner's division had been wiped out, a very
easy possibility for the overwhelming numbers confronting it while stretched out on a line
about three miles long, without any breastworks, the rich prize of our ambulance train, six
batteries of artillery, and all our wagons with their loads of supplies would have fallen into
Hood's hands, and the retreat of the four divisions would have been squarely cut off, while
having a short supply of artillery and no food or ammunition except what the men were carrying
in their haversacks and cartridge boxes. The escape of our army from this deadly peril was
largely due to the great skill with which General Stanley handled the situation at Spring Hill,
but manifestly no amount of skill on the part of Stanley could have saved us, where the disadvantages
were so great, if the enemy had improved with a very ordinary degree of vigor and intelligence
the opportunity opened to them by Schofield's delusion as to Hood's intention. General Hood
rode with the advance of his column until after it had crossed Rutherford's creek, two and
one-half miles south of Spring Hill. It was then about 3 o'clock. There was no bridge, and
his men had to wade the creek, which caused some delay. A short distance north of the crossing
Hood met Forrest, and got his report of the situation at Spring Hill as he had developed it
during the three hours preceding. He had met with resistance on so long a line that no doubt
he greatly overestimated the force holding Spring Hill, and such an estimate would agree with
the story told by the captured 64th men.

On the other hand, a courier had arrived with a report from Lee that Schofield's main body
was still in his front at Duck river, and Lee's report was confirmed by the sounds of the heavy
cannonading that had been coming from his direction. These reports disclosed that a part of
Schofield's army was at Spring Hill and a part at Duck river, but they conflicted as to which
position was held by his main body. In the uncertainty thus arising Hood decided, as his dispositions
clearly show, that his first move must be to plant Cheatham's corps on the pike between those
two parts. Developments would then determine his next move. Cleburne's division was the first
to cross the creek, and marching up the road until his advance was close to the woods where
Forrest's men were fighting with the 64th Ohio, Cleburne halted and formed his battle line
along the road facing west towards the Columbia pike. If the intention had been to make a direct
attack, his line would have formed facing north towards our line in the woods, where its position
had been developed by Forrest. The intention unquestionably was for Cleburne, avoiding any
encounter with our line in the woods, first to cross over to the pike and then change direction
and advance on Spring Hill astride the pike, while Bate's division, following Cleburne's, received
orders as reported by Bate, to cross to the pike and then sweep down the pike towards Columbia.
Hood himself gave the orders to Cleburne and Bate, and then established his headquarters at
the Thompson farm house, near by, about 500 yards west of the Rally Hill road, and nearly two
miles south of Spring Hill, where he remained till next morning. To save time Cleburne started
for the pike as soon as he was ready, and Bate, then forming on Cleburne's left, followed as
soon as his formation was completed.

While Cleburne and Bate were moving out, General Cheatham was at the crossing hurrying over
Brown's division. When Brown got over he could support either Cleburne or Bate, as developments
might dictate. Uncandid statements have been made that Cheatham's divisions were moved around
in a disjointed manner and without any plan. There was not only a logical plan but a successful
plan, if it had been carried out, in the orders given to Cheatham's divisions. The other four
divisions were halted south of Rutherford's creek, and fronted into line facing west towards
the Columbia pike. This proves that it was then Hood's belief that Schofield's main body was
still at Duck river. If it should march up the pike and attack Bate, the four divisions would
be on its flank. If it should attempt to reach the fortifications at Murfreesboro by cutting
across the country south of Spring Hill the four divisions would be in a position to intercept it.

General Bradley had four regiments in line in the woods on the ridge, with the left towards
the Rally Hill road and the right trending away towards the pike. They faced in a southeasterly
direction. To cover more ground there were short gaps between the regiments. The 65th Ohio
was the right regiment of the four, and to the right rear of the 65th was a gap of a couple
hundred yards extending out into cleared land, where the 42d Illinois was posted, refused as
to the 65th and facing south to cover that flank. To the front, right and rear of the 42d was
a broad expanse of rolling fields extending on the right to the pike, about 1,000 yards away,
where two guns were posted to sweep the fields in front of the 42d with their fire. To the
left of the 42d an extension of the woods ran out into the fields and concealed the 42d from
Cleburne until he had advanced almost abreast of its position. When the 64th came off the skirmish
line it was sent to the support of the 42d. The 36th Illinois, Opdycke's only reserve, was
hurried across on double-quick from the other side of Spring Hill to support the two guns at
the pike. As many guns of the reserve artillery as could be utilized were placed in battery
around the southeasterly skirt of the village, looking towards Bradley's position. Bradley's
men very hastily had constructed weak barricades of rails or anything else they could lay their
hands on. The 42d had such protection as was afforded by a rail fence.

Shortly before 4 o'clock, having completed his formation, Cleburne started to march across
to the pike. His division consisted of four brigades, but one was on detached duty, and he
had three in line--Lowrey's on his right, then Govan's, then Granbury's. First crossing a field
in his front, Lowrey entered the extension of the woods that has been mentioned, and on emerging
on the other side his right came in view within easy range of the 42d, and that regiment opened
an enfilading fire, Lowrey's line being then almost perpendicular to the line of the 42d. It
was this accident of Lowrey's right passing within range of the 42d that led to the failure
of Hood's plan, which, up to that minute, had been a great success. When the 42d opened fire
the two guns at the pike also opened, their fire crossing that of the 42d, and the 64th, running
forward and intermingling ranks with the 42d, poured in their fire. When our fire had thus
developed our position, out in those wide fields they could see just what we had. They pulled
down the rims of their old hats over their eyes, bent their heads to the storm of missiles
pouring upon them, changed direction to their right on double-quick in a manner that excited
our admiration, and a little later a long line came sweeping through the wide gap between the
right of the 42d and the pike, and swinging in towards our rear. Our line stood firm, holding
back the enemy in front until the flank movement had progressed so far as to make it a question
of legs to escape capture when the regimental commanders gave the reluctant order to fall back.
The contact was then so close that as the men on our right were running past the line closing
in on them they were called on with loud oaths, charging them with a Yankee canine descent,
to halt and surrender; and, not heeding the call, some of them were shot down with the muzzles
of the muskets almost touching their bodies. By the recession of the two regiments on the flank
the rear of the four regiments in the woods became exposed. They were attacked at the same
time by Forrest in front, and by Cleburne on their right and rear, and were speedily dislodged.
The attack was pressed with so much vigor that in a few minutes after the 42d had opened fire
Bradley's entire brigade was in rapid retreat towards Spring Hill, with Cleburne in close pursuit,
and pouring in a hot fire. In falling back we had to cross the valley of a small stream, and
I never think of our strenuous exertions to get out of a destructive cross-fire, while running
down the easy slope leading to the stream, without recalling the story of the officer who called
to a soldier making the best time he could to get out of a hot fire: "Stop, my man! What are
you running for?"

"Because I have no wings to fly with," called back the soldier over his shoulder while increasing
his efforts to make better time.

As we descended into the valley we uncovered our pursuers to the fire of the battery at the
village, which opened with shrapnel shells, firing over our heads. General Stanley, who was
in the battery, reported that not less than eight guns opened fire. As soon as Cleburne encountered
that fire he hastily drew back over the ridge, out of sight. All pursuit with its accompanying
direct and cross-fire having thus ceased, Bradley's men stopped running and walked on back
to the vicinity of the battery where a new line was formed without trouble or confusion. When
coming down the slope towards the stream Major Coulter, whose horse had been killed, was running
a few feet in front of me, and I was just speculating whether my short legs could keep up with
his long ones, when he called back over his shoulder: "Rally at this fence," meaning a rail
fence we were approaching. I had a poor opinion of the fence as a place to attempt a rally,
for we would still be exposed to a cross-fire, but wishing to obey orders I made for the strongest
looking fence corner in my front, and, jumping over and stopping behind it, looked around to
see if any concerted effort would be made to reform behind the fence. In my brief halt there
I had some opportunity to observe the effect of our artillery fire on the enemy. I saw by the
smoke where a number of our shells exploded, and they all seemed too high in the air and too
far to the rear, for I could not see any men knocked down by them. No doubt the fear of killing
some of our own men caused our gunners to aim high, and it is probable that the noise made
by so many guns and exploding shells had more to do with stopping the enemy than the execution
that was done. Their after-actions showed that they believed Bradley's brigade to have been
an outpost; that our main line was where the battery was posted, and that so much artillery
must have a correspondingly strong infantry support.

General Bradley reported a loss of 198 men in his brigade, nearly all of it falling on the
three regiments on the exposed flank, the other three regiments falling back with light loss
because their position had become untenable. He was disabled with a wound, and Colonel Conrad,
of the 15th Missouri, then assumed command of the brigade. By the casualties in the 65th Ohio
the command of that regiment devolved upon the adjutant, Brewer Smith, a boy only 19 years
old, and possibly the youngest officer to succeed to the command of a regiment throughout the war.

A regiment of the 23d corps which had come to Spring Hill as a train guard, and was placed
in support of the battery at the village, has persistently claimed that the salvation of our
army was due to the heroic stand it made after all of Wagner's division had run away. In a
historical sketch of the regiment occurs this statement:

"At Spring Hill the regiment had another opportunity to show its pluck. A division that had
been sent forward in charge of the trains was drawn up to resist any attack the rebels might
make while the regiment, being with the headquarters train, was ordered to support a battery
so placed as to sweep an open field in front of the troops. The enemy, emerging from the woods,
marched steadily up to the National lines, when the entire division broke and ran." That is
pretty strong language in view of the battle record of Wagner's division, for of the four brigades
out of all the brigades serving in all the Western armies, given prominent mention by Colonel
Fox in his book on regimental losses as famous fighting brigades, two, Opdycke's and Bradley's,
belonged to Wagner's division, to say nothing of the very awkward fact that the brigades of
Opdycke and Lane were on the other side of Spring Hill, out of sight of Cleburne's attack,
but it is seriously so stated--"the entire division broke and ran, leaving the regiment and
the battery to resist the attack. Fixing bayonets the men awaited the onset. As soon as the
enemy came within range they poured a well-directed fire into their ranks which, being seconded
by the battery, caused them to waver. Portions of the retreating division having rallied, the
rebels were compelled to betake themselves to the woods."

And in a paper on this campaign by a captain of the regiment, he relates how the officers of
the regiment tried to stop the flying troops, and taunted their officers with the bad example
they were setting their men; how the regiment opened a rapid, withering fire from a little
parapet of cartridges which the officers, breaking open boxes of ammunition, had built in front
of the men, and how their fire proved so destructive at that close range that it stopped Cheatham's
men who then fell back and commenced building breastworks. In calling them Cheatham's men,
did the captain wish to insinuate that Cheatham's whole corps was charging on the regiment?
He uses the words "withering," "destructive," and "that close range," in a way to raise the
inference that the contact was very close. The actual distance was shrapnel-shell range, for
the battery stopped Cleburne with those missiles before he had crossed the little stream more
than 1,000 yards away, so that instead of a cool regiment of exceptional staying qualities
delivering a destructive fire at very close range, as pictured by the captain, the truth discloses
a highly excited, not to say a badly scared regiment, wasting ammunition at too long range
to do any damage. That this was the truth is proved by the very significant fact, not deemed
worthy of mention in either of the accounts quoted, that the regiment did not lose a single
man killed or wounded; not one, and it was not protected by breastworks. With impressive mystery
the captain describes the regiment as what was left of it after the way it had been cut up
in the Atlantic campaign, with the same artful vagueness used in the matter of the range, seeking
to create the inference that the battle losses of the regiment had been very extraordinary.
Again, to be specific, the regiment lost in its three years' term of service two officers and
thirty-seven men killed or died of wounds, less than one-third the average loss of the six
regiments composing Bradley's brigade, and it stands 109th among the infantry regiments of
its State in the number of its battle losses, or, excepting six regiments that spent most of
their time in garrison duty, at the bottom of the list of all three years' regiments sent from
the State. It would appear that the 103d Ohio had become pretty well imbued with the spirit
characteristic of the headquarters with which it was associated, to claim credit in an inverse
ratio to services rendered.

When Cleburne changed direction his left swung in so close to the pike that the two guns and
the 36th Illinois were driven away and Cleburne could then have extended his left across the
pike without meeting with any further opposition.

Lowrey and Govan made the change in line of battle while Granbury faced to the right and followed
their movement in column of fours. Afterwards Granbury about faced, and moving back some distance
in column, then fronted into line and advanced to a farm fence paralleling the pike at a distance
variously stated at from 80 to 100 yards. His line there halted and laid down behind the fence.
Cleburne and Granbury were both killed next day, and it is not known why Granbury did not go
on and take possession of the pike. The brigades of Lowrey and Govan had become so badly mixed
up in the pursuit of Bradley, and in the recoil from the fire of the battery, that their line
had to be reformed. When this was accomplished the intrepid Cleburne was about to resume his
attack towards Spring Hill when he was stopped by an order from Cheatham, who had brought up
Brown's division on Cleburne's right, and had also sent a staff officer to recall Bate with
an order for him to close up and connect with Cleburne's left. This proves that developments,
probably the fire of so many guns opening on Cleburne, had convinced Cheatham that the force
holding Spring Hill was strong enough to demand the attention of his entire corps. His intention
was for Brown to lead in an attack, Cleburne to follow Brown, and Bate, when he got up, to
follow Cleburne. But on getting into position Brown reported to Cheatham that he was out-flanked
several hundred yards on his right, and that it would lead to inevitable disaster for him to
attack. The 97th Ohio, of Lane's brigade, was to the left of the battery, in front of Spring
Hill, with the left of the 97th extending towards Mount Carmel road. The 100th Illinois was
on the other side of the road, several hundred yards in advance of the 97th Ohio, and the two
regiments were connected by a part of the 40th Indiana deployed as skirmishers. That was the
force that paralyzed the action of Brown's veteran division. Cheatham then directed Brown to
refuse his right brigade to protect his flank, and to attack with the rest of his division,
but Brown, still hesitating, Cheatham then concluded that the force holding Spring Hill was
too strong for his corps alone to attack, for he reported to Hood that the line in his front
was too long for him, and that Stewart's corps must first come up and form on his right. But
before Stewart could get up, night had come.

It is notable that Brown's only excuse for not attacking was that he was out-flanked on his
right, for the claim has been made that Hood arrived in front of Spring Hill too late in the
day to accomplish anything, and Schofield himself has stated that his action was based on a
cool calculation, made from his intimate knowledge of Hood's character, who had been deficient
in mathematics as a cadet, and could make no accurate computation of the time required to overcome
difficulties; that Hood, marching by a muddy country road, would arrive in front of Spring
Hill tired, sleepy, and so much later than he had calculated, that he would defer all action
until next morning. Between "shortly after daylight," when he started from Duck river, and
3 o'clock, when he had crossed Rutherford's creek. Hood had ridden about ten miles--too short
a distance to tire him out, and too early in the day to become sleepy. He then sent forward
Cheatham's corps with plenty of time before night came for Cheatham to have made a secure lodgement
on the pike, or to have run over Wagner's division, the way it was strung out, if Cleburne's
attack had been promptly followed up with anything like the vigor with which he had jumped
on Bradley's brigade. Hood's arrival in front of Spring Hill that afternoon was clearly a contingency
unlooked for by Schofield, for it caught our army in a situation to leave no reasonable hope
of escape without dire disaster, and Schofield himself, as will appear, was thoroughly frightened
by the situation. That his after-version of the saving merit of his cool calculation was fully
accepted by the Administration is proved by the promotion he was given, when, in fact, his
bad miscalculation was responsible for getting the army into a trap from which it escaped through
the failure of the enemy to shut the door. Of the miracle of that escape much remains to be
told. When Wagner was coming to Spring Hill the 26th Ohio was detached from the column to guard
a country road entering the pike more than a mile southwest of Spring Hill. Captain Kelly,
of the 26th, informed me that the regiment was driven off that evening by a line of battle
so long as to extend far beyond either flank of the 26th. That was Bate's division, and after
driving off the 26th there was nothing whatever to prevent Bate from sweeping down the pike
towards Columbia. If he had diligently obeyed that order he would have progressed so far before
Cheatham's recall order reached him that he would have met Ruger coming to Spring Hill, and
then the cat would have been out of the bag. Bate declined to obey Cheatham's first order because
it conflicted with the order direct from Hood, under which he was acting, and Cheatham's order
had to be repeated. When the second order reached Bate he was still loitering where he had
encountered the 26th Ohio. He had wasted more than an hour of precious time in doing nothing,
for he had not only disobeyed Hood's order to sweep down the pike, but he had not even made
a lodgement on the pike. It was then about 6:30 o'clock, after dark, and Ruger's advance was
just coming along. First leaving orders for the other divisions to follow after dark, about
4:30 o'clock, Schofield had started with Ruger to reinforce Stanley. Ruger skirmished with
Bate at the place and time indicated, but as Bate was off to the east side, instead of astride
the pike, where, by Hood's order he should have been, Ruger had no difficulty in pushing past
Bate. Granbury's brigade was still lying behind the fence, close to the pike, and after passing
Bate, Ruger had to run the gantlet of Granbury's line. Granbury had been notified that Bate
was coming from the left, and hearing Ruger marching along the pike in the darkness, he mistook
him for Bate, so that Schofield himself, with Ruger, rode along right under the muzzles of
the muskets of Granbury's line, in blissful ignorance of the danger they were passing. Captain
English, Granbury's assistant adjutant-general, advanced towards the pike to investigate, but
was captured by the flankers covering the march of Ruger's column, belonging to the 23d Michigan.
Elias Bartlett of the 36th Illinois, was on picket on the pike at the bridge across the creek
a half mile south of Spring Hill, and he informed me that when Schofield came to his post he
began eagerly to inquire what had happened, saying that he had feared everything at Spring
Hill had been captured; that while they were talking, a Confederate picket, near enough to
hear the sound of their voices, fired on them, and Schofield then rode on. A little later Bate
came up through the fields, Granbury fell back from the fence and Cleburne and Bate then connected
and adjusted a new line with Bate's left brigade refused so as to face the pike and all the
rest of their line running across the country away from the pike.

Bate had utterly failed to grasp the significance of Ruger's passage, claiming that his flank
was in danger, and his representations to that effect were so urgent that Johnson's division
was brought up between 9 and 10 o'clock and posted on Bate's left, Johnson's line and the line
of Bate's refused brigade paralleling the pike at a distance of not more than 150 yards. Many
contradictory statements have been made relative to the distance of that part of the Confederate
line from the pike. The owner of the land pointed out to me a small plantation graveyard as
being just inside their line that night. He said that the position of their line was marked,
after they had gone in the morning, by the rail barricades they had built, and by the remains
of their bivouac fires, and he very positively asserted that no part of their line, facing
the pike, was distant more than 150 yards from the pike. All the intervening space was cleared
land. When the divisions of Cox, Wood and Kimball came up from Duck river later in the night,
they marched along unmolested within that easy range of the Confederate line, and could plainly
see the men around the bivouac fires. A staff officer was stationed on the pike beyond Johnson's
left, where the fires first came into view, to caution the troops as they came up to march
by the fires as silently as possible. Captain Bestow, of General Wood's staff, has related
that when the officer told Wood, riding at the head of his division, that the long line of
fires he could see paralleling the pike so closely on the right was the bivouac fires of the
enemy, the veteran Wood was so astounded that he exclaimed: "In God's name, no!" When they
came abreast of the fires one of Wood's orderlies, believing it to be impossible they could
be the enemy, started to ride over to one of the fires to light his pipe, but had gone only
a short distance when he was fired on, and came galloping back. A colonel of Johnson's division
has stated that he held his regiment in line, momentarily expecting an order to open fire,
until his men, one after another, overcome with fatigue, had all dropped to the ground to go
to sleep. Some of Johnson's men, on their own responsibility, went out on the pike between
the passage of the different divisions, to capture stragglers for the sake of getting the contents
of their haversacks. They were the men who made it unsafe, as reported by General Stanley,
for a staff officer or an orderly to ride along the pike when a column of troops was not passing.

General Hood had gone to bed in Thompson's house when he was informed that troops were marching
along the pike. Without getting out of bed he directed Colonel Mason, his chief of staff, to
send an order to Cheatham to advance on the pike and attack, but Mason admitted the next day,
as stated by Governor Harris, of Tennessee, who was serving as a volunteer aide on Hood's staff,
that he never sent the order. This strange neglect of the part of his own chief of staff affords
a fitting climax to all the rest of the imbecility that contributed to Hood's failure after
he had personally led the main body of his army to a position where by all ordinary chances
success should have been certain.

There is a bit of Stanley's report that gives a clear glimpse of the situation as Schofield
and Stanley believed it to be after they had met that night: "General Schofield arrived from
Columbia at 7 o'clock in the evening with Ruger's division. He found the enemy on the pike
and had quite a skirmish in driving them off. My pickets had reported seeing rebel columns
passing, east of our position, as if to get possession of the hills at Thompson's Station,
and the anxious question arose whether we could force our way through to Franklin. It was determined
to attempt this, and General Schofield pushed on with Ruger's division to ascertain the condition
of affairs."

Another vivid glimpse is afforded in the statement of O.J. Hack, a conductor on the railroad,
who was also interested in a store at Columbia. He came down the road that day on the last
train southbound, having in charge some goods for the store, and at the Spring Hill station
met the last train northbound, and from the trainmen learned that the army was retreating.
The two trains stood at the station that afternoon. Some time after dark, being anxious to
save his goods, Hack went over to Spring Hill in quest of a guard to run the trains back to
Franklin. On inquiring for headquarters he was directed to a large brick house where he found
Schofield and Stanley together. Schofield, recently arrived from Duck river, had just been
getting Stanley's account of the situation, and Hack said that Schofield was in a condition
of great agitation, "walking the floor and wringing his hands." When Hack had told what he
wanted, Schofield sharply replied that the enemy had possession of the road north of Spring
Hill, and the trains could not move. The report of Stanley and the statement of Hack concur
in showing that it was then Schofield's belief that Hood had possession of the Franklin pike;
that the army was caught in a trap; that the only way out was the desperate expedient of forcing
a passage by a night attack, and, failing in that, he must fight a battle next day under so
many disadvantages that ruinous defeat, with the probable loss of the army, was staring him
in the face. It would be interesting to know what Schofield then thought about his intimate
knowledge of Hood's character, and his cool calculation based thereon, for which he afterwards
so unblushingly claimed so much credit.

The two trains stood at the station until daylight was beginning to dawn when a detail of men
came and began to build fires to burn the cars, but the detail was driven away, and the fires
were extinguished before much damage was done, by the advance of the enemy. The two trains
thus captured afforded the transportation to which Hood alluded in a letter to Richmond, written
when he was in front of Nashville, wherein he stated that he had captured enough transportation
to make use of the railroad in bringing up supplies. But Schofield ignored the loss of the
two trains, for, in his official report, he explicitly states that with the exception of a
few wagons, and of a few cattle that were stampeded, he arrived at Franklin without any loss.

When Schofield "pushed on with Ruger's division to ascertain the condition of affairs," on
his arrival at Thompson's Station, three miles north of Spring Hill, he found camp fires still
burning, but the brigade of cavalry that had been in possession there, withdrew without making
any resistance. This very considerate action on the part of the cavalry was another of those
lucky fatalities that so notably contributed to the escape of our army when such special fatalities
were a vital necessity for its escape. After posting Ruger there to hold the cross roads Schofield
returned to Spring Hill, where he arrived about midnight at the same time with the advance
of Cox's division coming from Duck river. With this division he then hurried through to Franklin,
picking up Ruger as he passed along, and thus saddling Stanley with all the risk of saving
the artillery and the trains.

If they had been lost Stanley would have been the scapegoat, but with the same skill with which
that afternoon he had bluffed off ten-twelfths of Hood's army with a single division, Stanley
that night saved the artillery and the trains. At 3 o'clock in the morning, when only a part
of the trains had pulled out, the long column on the pike was brought to a standstill by an
attack some place in front. The situation was so critical that General Wood, who was then with
Stanley, believing it would be impossible to save both troops and trains, advised that the
trains be abandoned. But Stanley persevered until the attack was beaten off and the column
again in motion. The two trains of cars had to be abandoned because a bridge had been destroyed
north of the station, and about forty wagons were lost in the attacks made by Forrest between
Thompson's Station and Franklin. Everything else was saved.

And, by the way, Stanley was one of the many good soldiers who were overslaughed by the big
promotion obtained by Schofield. Stanley outranked Schofield, both as a captain in the regular
army and as a major-general of volunteers, but by assignment of the President, gained by his
extraordinary ability in the arts of diplomacy instead of by fighting ability displayed on
the battle field, Schofield was a department commander while Stanley was a corps commander,
and it thus happened that Stanley was serving under his junior in rank.

Wagner's division was the last to leave Spring Hill. When night came Bradley's brigade began
to intrench the line it was on, and kept at this work until nearly midnight when the men were
called under arms, and spent all the remainder of that anxious, weary night on their feet.
While standing in column we could hear to our left the rumble of the wheels while the artillery
and the wagons were pulling out, and much of the time could be heard the dull tread of many
feet and the clicking of accoutrements that told of the march of a column of troops along the
pike, but there was no other sound--not even the shout of a teamster to his mules or the crack
of a whip. All the surroundings were so impressive as to subdue the most boisterously profane
men. In expressing their dissatisfaction with the situation they were always careful to mutter
their curses in a tone so low as to be inaudible a short distance away, for, looking to our
right, we could see the glow on the sky made by the bivouac fires of the enemy, and in some
places could see the fires with a few men about them cooking something to eat, or otherwise
engaged, while most of their men were lying on the ground asleep. Every minute of those anxious
hours we were looking for them to awake to the opportunity that was slipping through their
fingers and grab hold of it by advancing and opening fire on the congested mass of troops and
trains that choked the pike. Occasionally our column would move on a short distance. Any orders
that may have been given were spoken in a low tone at the head of the column. You would be
apprised that the column was moving by the silent disappearance in the darkness of your file
leader. You would hurry after him, and taking, perhaps, not more than a dozen steps, would
be brought to a sudden halt by running against him, immediately followed by the man in your
rear bumping up against yourself. Then would follow an indefinite wait until the column would
again move on a short distance. The wearing suspense of the long waiting, while standing on
our feet; the exasperating halts following those false starts, when everybody was almost frantic
with impatience to go on; the excessive physical fatigue, combined with the intense mental
strain when already haggard from much loss of sleep during the three days and nights preceding,
make that night memorable as by far the most trying in nearly four years of soldiering. It
afforded unspeakable relief when, just as daylight was beginning to dawn, our column finally
got away in rapid motion for Franklin, the enemy dogging our heels with their close pursuit.

The location of Hood's headquarters was central as to the position of his troops until nightfall,
and was, therefore, a proper one. But he was too far away to get any personal knowledge as
to what was going on at Spring Hill, and he had to rely on the reports of his subordinates
who were in contact with our troops. The character of those reports is unmistakably indicated
by the second move that Hood made. His second move, made after the fighting was all over, and
he had received the reports of that fighting, was based on the theory that all of Schofield's
army had reached Spring Hill, for, abandoning all purpose of cutting off any part south of
Spring Hill, it contemplated seizing the pike north of Spring Hill and cutting off Schofield's
retreat to Franklin.

Between sunset and dark, as stated by General Stewart, which would be about 5 o'clock at that
season of the year, he received orders to cross Rutherford's creek with his corps, to pass
to the right of Cheatham's corps, and to extend his right across the Franklin pike. After about
five hours Stewart finally went into bivouac with his right more than a mile away from the
Franklin pike. His explanations for his failure were the lack of a competent guide, the darkness
of the night, and the fatigue of his men. To accomplish Hood's orders required a march of a
little less than four miles by Stewart's head of column--about three miles by a direct country
road leading into the Mount Carmel road, and the remaining distance across the country lying
between the Mount Carmel road and the Franklin pike. It would seem that a guide might have
been found among the cavalry who had explored the country that afternoon in developing the
position of our line between the Mount Carmel road and the railway station, west of the Franklin
pike; or there were men in some of the Tennessee regiments whose homes were in that vicinity,
who were thoroughly familiar with the ground. That no great difficulties were involved in the
march is proved by the fact that Johnson's division made a similar march in about two hours,
later in the night, to get into position on Bate's left. The night was as dark, the men were
as tired, the distance was as great, and the way was as difficult for Johnson as for Stewart.
In view of these plain facts it is a fair inference that Stewart made a very lukewarm effort
to accomplish Hood's orders; that it was possible for him, by a display of no more energy than
Johnson displayed, to have extended his right across the Franklin pike as early as 8 o'clock,
and then when Schofield started north with Ruger's division about 9 o'clock, he would have
found the way effectually barred.

The prime cause of Hood's failure was apparently the lack of confidence in his generalship
on the part of so many of his subordinates. They had been dissatisfied with his appointment
to the command of the army, and their dissatisfaction had been greatly increased by the failure
of his attacks on Sherman's lines in front of Atlanta. With the poor opinion they held of Hood's
ability it was not possible for them to give to any plan of his that whole-hearted, unquestioning
support that gives the best guarantee of success. Simple as his plan was, they all failed to
grasp the importance of getting possession of the pike and, Cleburne excepted, they all acted
as if they were expecting a repetition of the disastrous experience that had followed the attacks
on Sherman. The promptness with which Cleburne turned and rolled up Bradley's brigade when
he was so unexpectedly assailed on his own flank, was the only energetic action on the part
of any of them after they had crossed Rutherford's creek; and, no doubt, if Cleburne had not
been halted by Cheatham's order, he would have gone on until he had reaped the full measure
of success made so easily possible by the faulty situation of our army. But amid all the exciting
occurrences of that eventful evening it is amazing that no inkling of that faulty situation
seems ever to have entered the mind of any one of those veteran generals.

Hood made a mistake, as stated by himself, in not taking Bee's corps on the flank march instead
of Cheatham's corps. He believed that with Bee in Cheatham's place he would have succeeded,
and in view of the skill with which Lee executed the part assigned to him to hold Schofield
at Duck river, it is more than probable he would have given at Spring Hill far better support
than Cheatham gave. Hood led Cheatham within sight of an easy and brilliant success, and it
was the hesitation displayed by Cheatham. Brown and Bate at the critical time, that defeated
Hood's plan and saved Schofield's army. That their hesitation was not due to any lack of courage
on their part, or on the part of the troops they commanded, was abundantly proved by the unsurpassed
courage with which they assaulted at Franklin next day when it was everlastingly too late.
If they had fairly utilized at Spring Hill one-tenth part of the courage that was thrown away
on the breastworks of Franklin they would have changed the later current of the war with results
too far reaching to be estimated.

The prime purpose of Schofield's campaign was to delay Hood. How well he succeeded in that
purpose can be significantly stated in a single sentence: The evening of November 29th he was
at Duck river, and the morning of December 1st he was at Nashville, more than forty miles away.
Then followed the panicky feeling displayed by the Administration, and by General Grant, because
General Thomas was not ready to attack Hood immediately on his appearance in front of Nashville.
If Schofield's orders at Duck river had been to make no effort to delay Hood but to get inside
the fortifications of Nashville with the least possible delay, he would not have covered the
distance in so short a time without the spur of Hood's flank movement, and the celerity with
which he ran out of the country was due to the scare he got at Spring Hill.

From Franklin next day he wired General Thomas at Nashville that he had come through, but that
the least mistake on his part, or the fault of any subordinate, might have proved fatal, and
he did not want to get into such a tight place again; that a worse position for an inferior
force than the one at Franklin could hardly be found; that he had no doubt Forrest would be
in his rear next day, or doing some worse mischief, and that he ought to fall back to Brentwood
at once. In short, his Franklin dispatches, read by the light of Stanley's report and of Hack's
statement, clearly show that his mind was still dominated by the fright of Spring Hill, and
that he could feel no security short of Brentwood, where he would be backed up too close to
Nashville for Hood to have room to repeat that terrible flank movement. Not even the wrecking
of Hood's army on the breastworks of Franklin that evening could reassure Schofield. He insisted
on retreating to Nashville that night when thousands of the men were in such a condition from
more than forty hours' of incessant marching, fortifying and fighting that they dozed on their
feet while they were walking, and in spite of the manly protest of General Cox, who was so
urgent in his efforts to persuade Schofield no more running was necessary, that he offered
to pledge his head he could hold the position.
