  WHO HAS DONE SO MUCH TO WELCOME AMERICANS

  WITH TRUE ENGLISH HOSPITALITY,

  GIVE ENGLISHMEN A MORE ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF,

  AND MORE INTIMATE RELATIONS WITH,

  THE UNITED STATES,

  This Work on England,

  BY AN AMERICAN,

  IS RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED.

INTRODUCTION.

No land possesses greater attractions for the American tourist than England. It was the home
of his forefathers; its history is to a great extent the history of his own country; and he
is bound to it by the powerful ties of consanguinity, language, laws, and customs. When the
American treads the busy London streets, threads the intricacies of the Liverpool docks and
shipping, wanders along the green lanes of Devonshire, climbs Alnwick's castellated walls,
or floats upon the placid bosom of the picturesque Wye, he seems almost as much at home as
in his native land. But, apart from these considerations of common Anglo-Saxon paternity, no
country in the world is more interesting to the intelligent traveller than England. The British
system of entail, whatever may be our opinion of its political and economic merits, has built
up vast estates and preserved the stately homes, renowned castles, and ivy-clad ruins of ancient
and celebrated structures, to an extent and variety that no other land can show. The remains
of the abbeys, castles, churches, and ancient fortresses in England and Wales that war and
time together have crumbled and scarred tell the history of centuries, while countless legends
of the olden time are revived as the tourist passes them in review. England, too, has other
charms than these. British scenery, though not always equal in sublimity and grandeur to that
displayed in many parts of our own country, is exceedingly beautiful, and has always been a
fruitful theme of song and story.

Yet there are few satisfactory and comprehensive books about this land that is so full of renowned
memorials of the past and so generously gifted by Nature. It would be impossible to describe
everything within the brief compass of a single book, but it is believed that nearly all the
more prominent places in England and Wales are included, with enough of their history and legend
to make the description interesting. The artist's pencil has also been called into requisition,
and the four hundred and eighty-seven illustrations will give an idea, such as no words can
convey, of the attractions England presents to the tourist.

The work has been arranged in eight tours, with Liverpool and London as the two starting-points,
and each route following the lines upon which the sightseer generally advances in the respective
directions taken. Such is probably the most convenient form for the travelling reader, as the
author has found from experience, while a comprehensive index will make reference easy to different
localities and persons. Without further introduction it is presented to the public, in the
confident belief that the interest developed in its subject will excuse any shortcomings that
may be found in its pages.

ENGLAND, PICTURESQUE AND DESCRIPTIVE.

I.

LIVERPOOL WESTWARD TO THE WELSH COAST.

LIVERPOOL.

The American transatlantic tourist, after a week or more spent upon the ocean, is usually glad
to again see the land. After skirting the bold Irish coast, and peeping into the pretty cove
of Cork, with Queenstown in the background, and passing the rocky headlands of Wales, the steamer
that brings him from America carefully enters the Mersey River. The shores are low but picturesque
as the tourist moves along the estuary between the coasts of Lancashire and Cheshire, and passes
the great beacon standing up solitary and alone amid the waste of waters, the Perch Rock Light
off New Brighton on the Cheshire side. Thus he comes to the world's greatest seaport--Liverpool--and
the steamer finally drops her anchor between the miles of docks that front the two cities,
Liverpool on the left and Birkenhead on the right. Forests of masts loom up behind the great
dock-walls, stretching far away on either bank, while a fleet of arriving or departing steamers
is anchored in a long line in mid-channel. Odd-looking, low, black tugs, pouring out thick
smoke from double funnels, move over the water, and one of them takes the passengers alongside
the capacious structure a half mile long, built on pontoons, so it can rise and fall with the
tides, and known as the Prince's Landing-Stage, where the customs officers perform their brief
formalities and quickly let the visitor go ashore over the fine floating bridge into the city.

At Liverpool most American travellers begin their view of England. It is the great city of
ships and sailors and all that appertains to the sea, and its 550,000 population are mainly
employed in mercantile life and the myriad trades that serve the ship or deal in its cargo,
for fifteen thousand to twenty thousand of the largest vessels of modern commerce will enter
the Liverpool docks in a year, and its merchants own 7,000,000 tonnage. Fronting these docks
on the Liverpool side of the Mersey is the great sea-wall, over five miles long, behind which
are enclosed 400 acres of water-surface in the various docks, that are bordered by sixteen
miles' length of quays. On the Birkenhead side of the river there are ten miles of quays in
the docks that extend for over two miles along the bank. These docks, which are made necessary
to accommodate the enormous commerce, have cost over $50,000,000, and are the crowning glory
of Liverpool. They are filled with the ships of all nations, and huge storehouses line the
quays, containing products from all parts of the globe, yet chiefly the grain and cotton, provisions,
tobacco, and lumber of America. Railways run along the inner border of the docks on a street
between them and the town, and along their tracks horses draw the freight-cars, while double-decked
passenger-cars also run upon them with broad wheels fitting the rails, yet capable of being
run off whenever the driver wishes to get ahead of the slowly-moving freight-cars. Ordinary
wagons move upon Strand street alongside, with horses of the largest size drawing them, the
huge growth of the Liverpool horses being commensurate with the immense trucks and vans to
which these magnificent animals are harnessed.

Liverpool is of great antiquity, but in the time of William the Conqueror was only a fishing-village.
Liverpool Castle, long since demolished, was a fortress eight hundred years ago, and afterward
the rival families of Molineux and Stanley contended for the mastery of the place. It was a
town of slow growth, however, and did not attain full civic dignity till the time of Charles
I. It was within two hundred years that it became a seaport of any note. The first dock was
opened in 1699, and strangely enough it was the African slave-trade that gave the Liverpool
merchants their original start. The port sent out its first slave-ship in 1709, and in 1753
had eighty-eight ships engaged in the slave-trade, which carried over twenty-five thousand
slaves from Africa to the New World that year. Slave-auctions were frequent in Liverpool, and
one of the streets where these sales were effected was nicknamed "Negro street." The agitation
for the abolition of the trade was carried on a long time before Liverpool submitted, and then
privateering came prominently out as the lucrative business a hundred years ago during the
French wars, that brought Liverpool great wealth. Next followed the development of trade with
the East Indies, and finally the trade with America has grown to such enormous proportions
in the present century as to eclipse all other special branches of Liverpool commerce, large
as some of them are. This has made many princely fortunes for the merchants and shipowners,
and their wealth has been liberally expended in beautifying their city. It has in recent years
had very rapid growth, and has greatly increased its architectural adornments. Most amazing
has been this advancement since the time in the last century when the mayor and corporation
entertained Prince William of Gloucester at dinner, and, pleased at the appetite he developed,
one of them called out, "Eat away, Your Royal Highness; there's plenty more in the kitchen!"
The mayor was Jonas Bold, and afterwards, taking the prince to church, they were astonished
to find that the preacher had taken for his text the words, "Behold, a greater than Jonas is here."

Liverpool has several fine buildings. Its Custom House is a large Ionic structure of chaste
design, with a tall dome that can be seen from afar, and richly decorated within. The Town
Hall and the Exchange buildings make up the four sides of an enclosed quadrangle paved with
broad flagstones. Here, around the attractive Nelson monument in the centre, the merchants
meet and transact their business. The chief public building is St. George's Hall, an imposing
edifice, surrounded with columns and raised high above one side of an open square, and costing
$2,000,000 to build. It is a Corinthian building, having at one end the Great Hall, one hundred
and sixty-nine feet long, where public meetings are held, and court-rooms at the other end.
Statues of Robert Peel, Gladstone, and Stephenson, with other great men, adorn the Hall. Sir
William Brown, who amassed a princely fortune in Liverpool, has presented the city with a splendid
free library and museum, which stands in a magnificent position on Shaw's Brow. Many of the
streets are lined with stately edifices, public and private, and most of these avenues diverge
from the square fronting St. George's Hall, opposite which is the fine station of the London
and North-western Railway, which, as is the railroad custom in England, is also a large hotel.
The suburbs of Liverpool are filled for a wide circuit with elegant rural homes and surrounding
ornamental grounds, where the opulent merchants live. They are generally bordered with high
stone walls, interfering with the view, and impressing the visitor strongly with the idea that
an Englishman's house is his castle. Several pretty parks with ornamental lakes among their
hills are also in the suburbs. Yet it is the vast trade that is the glory of Liverpool, for
it is but an epitome of England's commercial greatness, and is of comparatively modern growth.
"All this," not long ago said Lord Erskine, speaking of the rapid advancement of Liverpool,
"has been created by the industry and well-disciplined management of a handful of men since
I was a boy."

KNOWSLEY HALL.

A few miles out of Liverpool is the village of Prescot, where Kemble the tragedian was born,
and where the people at the present time are largely engaged in watchmaking. Not far from Prescot
is one of the famous homes of England--Knowsley Hall, the seat of the Stanleys and of the Earls
of Derby for five hundred years. The park covers two thousand acres and is almost ten miles
in circumference. The greater portion of the famous house was built in the time of George II.
It is an extensive and magnificent structure, and contains many art-treasures in its picture-gallery
by Rembrandt, Rubens, Correggio, Teniers, Vandyke, Salvator Rosa, and others. The Stanleys
are one of the governing families of England, the last Earl of Derby having been premier in
1866, and the present earl having also been a cabinet minister. The crest of the Stanleys represents
the Eagle and the Child, and is derived from the story of a remote ancestor who, cherishing
an ardent desire for a male heir, and having only a daughter, contrived to have an infant conveyed
to the foot of a tree in the park frequented by an eagle. Here he and his lady, taking a walk,
found the child as if by accident, and the lady, considering it a gift from Heaven brought
by the eagle and miraculously preserved, adopted the boy as her heir. From this time the crest
was assumed, but we are told that the old knight's conscience smote him at the trick, and on
his deathbed he bequeathed the chief part of his fortune to the daughter, from whom are descended
the present family.

THE ANCIENT CITY OF CHESTER.

Not far from Liverpool, and in the heart of Cheshire, we come to the small but famous river
Dee and the old and very interesting city of Chester. It is built in the form of a quadrant,
its four walls enclosing a plot about a half mile square. The walls, which form a promenade
two miles around, over which every visitor should tramp; the quaint gates and towers; the "Rows,"
or arcades along the streets, which enable the sidewalks to pass under the upper stories of
the houses by cutting away the first-floor front rooms; and the many ancient buildings,--are
all attractive. The Chester Cathedral is a venerable building of red sandstone, which comes
down to us from the twelfth century, though it has recently been restored. It is constructed
in the Perpendicular style of architecture, with a square and turret-surmounted central tower.
This is the Cathedral of St. Werburgh, and besides other merits of the attractive interior,
the southern transept is most striking from its exceeding length. The choir is richly ornamented
with carvings and fine woodwork, the Bishop's Throne having originally been a pedestal for
the shrine of St. Werburgh. The cathedral contains several ancient tombs of much interest,
and the elaborate Chapter Room, with its Early English windows and pillars, is much admired.
In this gorgeous structure the word of God is preached from a Bible whose magnificently-bound
cover is inlaid with precious stones and its markers adorned with pearls. The book is the Duke
of Westminster's gift, that nobleman being the landlord of much of Chester. In the nave of
the cathedral are two English battle-flags that were at Bunker Hill. Chester Castle, now used
as a barrack for troops, has only one part of the ancient edifice left, called Julius Cæsar's
Tower, near which the Dee is spanned by a fine single-arch bridge.

The quaintest part of this curious old city of Chester is no doubt the "Rows," above referred
to. These arcades, which certainly form a capital shelter from the hot sun or rain, were, according
to one authority, originally built as a refuge for the people in case of sudden attack by the
Welsh; but according to others they originated with the Romans, and were used as the vestibules
of the houses; and this seems to be the more popular theory with the townsfolk. Under the "Rows"
are shops of all sizes, and some of the buildings are grotesquely attractive, especially the
curious one bearing the motto of safety from the plague, "God's providence is mine inheritance,"
standing on Watergate street, and known as "God's Providence House;" and "Bishop Lloyd's Palace,"
which is ornamented with quaint wood-carvings. The "Old Lamb Row," where Randall Holme, the
Chester antiquary, lived, stood by itself, obeying no rule of regularity, and was regarded
as a nuisance two hundred years ago, though later it was highly prized. The city corporation
in 1670 ordered that "the nuisance erected by Randall Holme in his new building in Bridge street
be taken down, as it annoys his neighbors, and hinders their prospect from their houses." But
this law seems to have been enforced no more than many others are on either side of the ocean,
for the "nuisance" stood till 1821, when the greater part of it, the timbers having rotted,
fell of its own accord. The "Dark Row" is the only one of these strange arcades that is closed
from the light, for it forms a kind of tunnel through which the footwalk goes. Not far from
this is the famous old "Stanley House," where one unfortunate Earl of Derby spent the last
day before his execution in 1657 at Bolton. The carvings on the front of this house are very
fine, and there is told in reference to the mournful event that marks its history the following
story: Lieutenant Smith came from the governor of Chester to notify the condemned earl to be
ready for the journey to Bolton. The earl asked, "When would you have me go?" "To-morrow, about
six in the morning," said Smith. "Well," replied the earl, "commend me to the governor, and
tell him I shall be ready by that time." Then said Smith, "Doth your lordship know any friend
or servant that would do the thing your lordship knows of? It would do well if you had a friend."
The earl replied, "What do you mean? to cut off my head?" Smith said, "Yes, my lord, if you
could have a friend." The earl answered, "Nay, sir, if those men that would have my head will
not find one to cut it off, let it stand where it is."

It is easy in this strange old city to carry back the imagination for centuries, for it preserves
its connection with the past better perhaps than any other English town. The city holds the
keys of the outlet of the Dee, which winds around it on two sides, and is practically one of
the gates into Wales. Naturally, the Romans established a fortress here more than a thousand
years ago, and made it the head-quarters of their twentieth legion, who impressed upon the
town the formation of a Roman camp, which it bears to this day. The very name of Chester is
derived from the Latin word for a camp. Many Roman fragments still remain, the most notable
being the Hyptocaust. This was found in Watergate street about a century ago, together with
a tessellated pavement. There have also been exhumed Roman altars, tombs, mosaics, pottery
and other similar relics. The city is built upon a sandstone rock, and this furnishes much
of the building material, so that most of the edifices have their exteriors disintegrated by
the elements, particularly the churches--a peculiarity that may have probably partly justified
Dean Swift's epigram, written when his bile was stirred because a rainstorm had prevented some
of the Chester clergy from dining with him:

  "Churches and clergy of this city
    Are very much akin:
  They're weather-beaten all without,
    And empty all within."

The modernized suburbs of Chester, filled with busy factories, are extending beyond the walls
over a larger surface than the ancient town itself. At the angles of the old walls stand the
famous towers--the Phoenix Tower, Bonwaldesthorne's Tower, Morgan's Mount, the Goblin Tower,
and the Water Tower, while the gates in the walls are almost equally famous--the Eastgate,
Northgate, Watergate, Bridgegate, Newgate, and Peppergate. The ancient Abbey of St. Mary had
its site near the castle, and not far away are the picturesque ruins of St. John's Chapel,
outside the walls. According to a local legend, its neighborhood had the honor of sheltering
an illustrious fugitive. Harold, the Saxon king, we are told, did not fall at Hastings, but,
escaping, spent the remainder of his life as a hermit, dwelling in a cell near this chapel
and on a cliff alongside the Dee. The four streets leading from the gates at the middle of
each side of the town come together in the centre at a place formerly known as the "Pentise,"
where was located the bull-ring at which was anciently carried on the refining sport of "bull-baiting"
while the mayor and corporation, clad in their gowns of office, looked on approvingly. Prior
to this sport beginning, we are told that solemn proclamation was made for "the safety of the
king and the mayor of Chester"--that "if any man stands within twenty yards of the bull-ring,
let him take what comes." Here stood also the stocks and pillory. Amid so much that is ancient
and quaint, the new Town Hall, a beautiful structure recently erected, is naturally most attractive,
its dedication to civic uses having been made by the present Prince of Wales, who bears among
many titles that of Earl of Chester. But this is about the only modern attraction this interesting
city possesses. At an angle of the walls are the "Dee Mills," as old as the Norman Conquest,
and famous in song as the place where the "jolly miller once lived on the Dee." Full of attractions
within and without, it is difficult to tear one's self away from this quaint city, and therefore
we will agree, at least in one sense, with Dr. Johnson's blunt remark to a lady friend: "I
have come to Chester, madam, I cannot tell how, and far less can I tell how to get away from it."

CHESHIRE.

The county of Cheshire has other attractions. But a short distance from Chester, in the valley
of the Dee, is Eaton Hall, the elaborate palace of the Duke of Westminster and one of the finest
seats in England, situated in a park of eight hundred acres that extends to the walls of Chester.
This palace has recently been almost entirely rebuilt and modernized, and is now the most spacious
and splendid example of Revived Gothic architecture in England. The house contains many works
of art--statues by Gibson, paintings by Rubens and others--and is full of the most costly and
beautiful decorations and furniture, being essentially one of the show-houses of Britain. In
the extensive gardens are a Roman altar found in Chester and a Greek altar brought from Delphi.
At Hawarden Castle, seven miles from Chester, is the home of William E. Gladstone, and in its
picturesque park are the ruins of the ancient castle, dating from the time of the Tudors, and
from the keep of which there is a fine view of the Valley of the Dee. The ruins of Ewloe Castle,
six hundred years old, are not far away, but so buried in foliage that they are difficult to
find. Two miles from Chester is Hoole House, formerly Lady Broughton's, famous for its rockwork,
a lawn of less than an acre exquisitely planted with clipped yews and other trees being surrounded
by a rockery over forty feet high. In the Wirral or Western Cheshire are several attractive
villages. At Bidston, west of Birkenhead and on the sea-coast, is the ancient house that was
once the home of the unfortunate Earl of Derby, whose execution is mentioned above. Congleton,
in Eastern Cheshire, stands on the Dane, in a lovely country, and is a good example of an old
English country-town. Its Lion Inn is a fine specimen of the ancient black-and-white gabled
hostelrie which novelists love so well to describe. At Nantwich is a curious old house with
a heavy octagonal bow-window in the upper story overhanging a smaller lower one, telescope-fashion.
The noble tower of Nantwich church rises above, and the building is in excellent preservation.

Nearly in the centre of Cheshire is the stately fortress of Beeston Castle, standing on a sandstone
rock rising some three hundred and sixty feet from the flat country. It was built nearly seven
hundred years ago by an Earl of Cheshire, then just returned from the Crusades. Standing in
an irregular court covering about five acres, its thick walls and deep ditch made it a place
of much strength. It was ruined prior to the time of Henry VIII., having been long contended
for and finally dismantled in the Wars of the Roses. Being then rebuilt, it became a famous
fortress in the Civil Wars, having been seized by the Roundheads, then surprised and taken
by the Royalists, alternately besieged and defended afterward, and finally starved into surrender
by the Parliamentary troops in 1645. This was King Charles's final struggle, though the castle
did not succumb till after eighteen weeks' siege, and its defenders were forced to eat cats
and rats to satisfy hunger, and were reduced to only sixty. Beeston Castle was then finally
dismantled, and its ruins are now an attraction to the tourist. Lea Hall, an ancient and famous
timbered mansion, surrounded by a moat, was situated about six miles from Chester, but the
moat alone remains to show where it stood. Here lived Sir Hugh Calveley, one of Froissart's
heroes, who was governor of Calais when it was held by the English, and is buried under a sumptuous
tomb in the church of the neighboring college of Bunbury, which he founded. His armed effigy
surmounts the tomb, and the inscription says he died on St. George's Day, 1394.

THE RIVER DEE.

Frequent reference has been made to the river Dee, the Deva of the Welsh, which is unquestionably
one of the finest streams of Britain. It rises in the Arran Fowddwy, one of the chief Welsh
mountains, nearly three thousand feet high, and after a winding course of about seventy miles
falls into the Irish Sea. This renowned stream has been the theme of many a poet, and after
expanding near its source into the beautiful Bala Lake, whose bewitching surroundings are nearly
all described in polysyllabic and unpronounceable Welsh names, and are popular among artists
and anglers, it flows through Edeirnim Vale, past Corwen. Here a pathway ascends to the eminence
known as Glendower's Seat, with which tradition has closely knit the name of the Welsh hero,
the close of whose marvellous career marked the termination of Welsh independence. Then the
romantic Dee enters the far-famed Valley of Llangollen, where tourists love to roam, and where
lived the "Ladies of Llangollen." We are told that these two high-born dames had many lovers,
but, rejecting all and enamored only of each other, Lady Butler and Miss Ponsonby, the latter
sixteen years the junior of the former, determined on a life of celibacy. They eloped together
from Ireland, were overtaken and brought back, and then a second time decamped--on this occasion
in masquerade, the elder dressed as a peasant and the younger as a smart groom in top-boots.
Escaping pursuit, they settled in Llangollen in 1778 at the quaint little house called Plas
Newydd, and lived there together for a half century. Their costume was extraordinary, for they
appeared in public in blue riding-habits, men's neckcloths, and high hats, with their hair
cropped short. They had antiquarian tastes, which led to the accumulation of a vast lot of
old wood-carvings and stained glass, gathered from all parts of the world and worked into the
fittings and adornment of their home. They were on excellent terms with all the neighbors,
and the elder died in 1829, aged ninety, and the younger two years afterward, aged seventy-six.
Their remains lie in Llangollen churchyard.

Within this famous valley are the ruins of Valle-Crucis Abbey, the most picturesque abbey ruin
in North Wales. An adjacent stone cross gave it the name six hundred years ago, when it was
built by the great Madoc for the Cistercian monks. The ruins in some parts are now availed
of for farm-houses. Fine ash trees bend over the ruined arches, ivy climbs the clustered columns,
and the lancet windows with their delicate tracery are much admired. The remains consist of
the church, abbot's lodgings, refectory, and dormitory. The church was cruciform, and is now
nearly roofless, though the east and west ends and the southern transept are tolerably perfect,
so that much of the abbey remains. It was occupied by the Cistercians, and was dedicated to
the Virgin Mary. The ancient cross, of which the remains are still standing near by, is Eliseg's
Pillar, erected in the seventh century as a memorial of that Welsh prince. It was one of the
earliest lettered stones in Britain, standing originally about twelve feet high. From this
cross came the name of Valle Crucis, which in the thirteenth century was given to the famous
abbey. The great Madoc, who lived in the neighboring castle of Dinas Bran, built this abbey
to atone for a life of violence. The ruins of his castle stand on a hill elevated about one
thousand feet above the Dee. Bran in Welsh means crow, so that the English know it as Crow
Castle. From its ruins there is a beautiful view over the Valley of Llangollen. Farther down
the valley is the mansion of Wynnstay, in the midst of a large and richly wooded park, a circle
of eight miles enclosing the superb domain, within which are herds of fallow-deer and many
noble trees. The old mansion was burnt in 1858, and an imposing structure in Renaissance now
occupies the site. Fine paintings adorn the walls by renowned artists, and the Dee foams over
its rocky bed in a sequestered dell near the mansion. Memorial columns and tablets in the park
mark notable men and events in the Wynn family, the chief being the Waterloo Tower, ninety
feet high. Far away down the valley a noble aqueduct by Telford carries the Ellesmere Canal
over the Dee--the Pont Cysylltau--supported on eighteen piers of masonry at an elevation of
one hundred and twenty-one feet, while a mile below is the still more imposing viaduct carrying
the Great Western Railway across.

Not far distant is Chirk Castle, now the home of Mr. R. Myddelton Biddulph, a combination of
a feudal fortress and a modern mansion. The ancient portion, still preserved, was built by
Roger Mortimer, to whom Edward I. granted the lordship of Chirk. It was a bone of contention
during the Civil Wars, and when they were over, $150,000 were spent in repairing the great
quadrangular fortress. It stands in a noble situation, and on a clear day portions of seventeen
counties can be seen from the summit. Still following down the picturesque river, we come to
Bangor-ys-Coed, or "Bangor-in-the-Wood," in Flintshire, once the seat of a famous monastery
that disappeared twelve hundred years ago. Here a pretty bridge crosses the river, and a modern
church is the most prominent structure in the village. The old monastery is said to have been
the home of twenty-four hundred monks, one half of whom were slain in a battle near Chester
by the heathen king Ethelfrith, who afterwards sacked the monastery, but the Welsh soon gathered
their forces again and took terrible vengeance. Many ancient coffins and Roman remains have
been found here. The Dee now runs with swift current past Overton to the ancient town of Holt,
whose charter is nearly five hundred years old, but whose importance is now much less than
of yore. Holt belongs to the debatable Powisland, the strip of territory over which the English
and Welsh fought for centuries. Holt was formerly known as Lyons, and was a Roman outpost of
Chester. Edward I. granted it to Earl Warren, who built Holt Castle, of which only a few quaint
pictures now exist, though it was a renowned stronghold in its day. It was a five-sided structure
with a tower on each corner, enclosing an ample courtyard. After standing several sieges in
the Civil Wars of Cromwell's time, the battered castle was dismantled.

The famous Wrexham Church, whose tower is regarded as one of the "seven wonders of Wales,"
is three miles from Holt, and is four hundred years old. Few churches built as early as the
reign of Henry VIII. can compare with this. It is dedicated to St. Giles, and statues of him
and of twenty-nine other saints embellish niches in the tower. Alongside of St. Giles is the
hind that nourished him in the desert. The bells of Wrexham peal melodiously over the valley,
and in the vicarage the good Bishop Heber wrote the favorite hymn, "From Greenland's Icy Mountains."
Then the Dee flows on past the ducal palace of Eaton Hall, and encircles Chester, which has
its race-course, "The Roodee"--where they hold an annual contest in May for the "Chester Cup"--enclosed
by a beautiful semicircle of the river. Then the Dee flows on through a straight channel for
six miles to its estuary, which broadens among treacherous sands and flats between Flintshire
and Cheshire, till it falls into the Irish Sea. Many are the tales of woe that are told of
the "Sands o' Dee," along which the railway from Chester to Holyhead skirts the edge in Flintshire.
Many a poor girl, sent for the cattle wandering on these sands, has been lost in the mist that
rises from the sea, and drowned by the quickly rushing waters. Kingsley has plaintively told
the story in his mournful poem:

  "They rowed her in across the rolling foam--
        The cruel, crawling foam,
        The cruel, hungry foam--
     To her grave beside the sea;
  But still the boatmen hear her call her cattle home
     Across the Sands o' Dee."

FLINT AND DENBIGH.

Let us now journey westward from the Dee into Wales, coming first into Flintshire. The town
of Flint, it is conjectured, was originally a Roman camp, from the design and the antiquities
found there. Edward I., six hundred years ago, built Flint Castle upon an isolated rock in
a marsh near the river, and after a checquered history it was dismantled in the seventeenth
century. From the railway between Chester and Holyhead the ruins of this castle are visible
on its low freestone rock; it is a square, with round towers at three of the corners, and a
massive keep at the other, formed like a double tower and detached from the main castle. This
was the "dolorous castle" into which Richard II. was inveigled at the beginning of his imprisonment,
which ended with abdication, and finally his death at Pomfret. The story is told that Richard
had a fine greyhound at Flint Castle that often caressed him, but when the Duke of Lancaster
came there the greyhound suddenly left Richard and caressed the duke, who, not knowing the
dog, asked Richard what it meant. "Cousin," replied the king, "it means a great deal for you
and very little for me. I understand by it that this greyhound pays his court to you as King
of England, which you will surely be, and I shall be deposed, for the natural instinct of the
dog shows it to him; keep him, therefore, by your side." Lancaster treasured this, and paid
attention to the dog, which would nevermore follow Richard, but kept by the side of the Duke
of Lancaster, "as was witnessed," says the chronicler Froissart, "by thirty thousand men."

Rhuddlan Castle, also in Flintshire, is a red sandstone ruin of striking appearance, standing
on the Clwyd River. When it was founded no one knows accurately, but it was rebuilt seven hundred
years ago, and was dismantled, like many other Welsh castles, in 1646. It was at Rhuddlan that
Edward I. promised the Welsh "a native prince who never spoke a word of English, and whose
life and conversation no man could impugn;" and this promise he fulfilled to the letter by
naming as the first English Prince of Wales his infant son, then just born at Caernarvon Castle.
Six massive towers flank the walls of this famous castle, and are in tolerably fair preservation.
Not far to the southward is the eminence known by the Welsh as "Yr-Wyddgrug," or "a lofty hill,"
and which the English call Mold. On this hill was a castle of which little remains now but
tracings of the ditches, larches and other trees peacefully growing on the site of the ancient
stronghold. Off toward Wrexham are the ruins of another castle, known as Caergwrle, or "the
camp of the giant legion." This was of Welsh origin, and commanded the entrance to the Vale
of Alen; the English called it Hope Castle.

Adjoining Flintshire is Denbigh, with the quiet watering-place of Abergele out on the Irish
Sea. About two miles away is St. Asaph, with its famous cathedral, having portions dating from
the thirteenth century. The great castle of Denbigh, when in its full glory, had fortifications
one and a half miles in circumference. It stood on a steep hill at the county-town, where scanty
ruins now remain, consisting chiefly of an immense gateway with remains of flanking towers.
Above the entrance is a statue of the Earl of Lincoln, its founder in the thirteenth century.
His only son was drowned in the castle-well, which so affected the father that he did not finish
the castle. Edward II. gave Denbigh to Despenser; Leicester owned it in Elizabeth's time; Charles
II. dismantled it. The ruins impress the visitor with the stupendous strength of the immense
walls of this stronghold, while extensive passages and dungeons have been explored beneath
the surface for long distances. In one chamber near the entrance-tower, which had been walled
up, a large amount of gunpowder was found. At Holywell, now the second town in North Wales,
is the shrine to which pilgrims have been going for many centuries. At the foot of a steep
hill, from an aperture in the rock, there rushes forth a torrent of water at the rate of eighty-four
hogsheads a minute; whether the season be wet or be dry, the sacred stream gushing forth from
St. Winifrede's Well varies but little, and around it grows the fragrant moss known as St.
Winifrede's Hair. The spring has valuable medicinal virtues, and an elegant dome covering it
supports a chapel. The little building is an exquisite Gothic structure built by Henry VII.
A second basin is provided, into which bathers may descend. The pilgrims to this holy well
have of late years decreased in numbers; James II., who, we are told, "lost three kingdoms
for a mass," visited this well in 1686, and "received as a reward the undergarment worn by
his great-grandmother, Mary Queen of Scots, on the day of her execution." This miraculous spring
gets its name from the pious virgin Winifrede. She having been seen by the Prince of Wales,
Caradoc, he was struck by her great beauty and attempted to carry her off; she fled to the
church, the prince pursuing, and, overtaking her, he in rage drew his sword and struck off
her head; the severed head bounded through the church-door and rolled to the foot of the altar.
On the spot where it rested a spring of uncommon size burst forth. The pious priest took up
the head, and at his prayer it was united to the body, and the virgin, restored to life, lived
in sanctity for fifteen years afterwards: miracles were wrought at her tomb; the spring proved
another Pool of Bethesda, and to this day we are told that the votive crutches and chairs left
by the cured remain hanging over St. Winifrede's Well.

South of Denbigh, in Montgomeryshire, are the ruins of Montgomery Castle, long a frontier fortress
of Wales, around which many hot contests have raged: a fragment of a tower and portions of
the walls are all that remain. Powys Castle is at Welsh Pool, and is still preserved--a red
sandstone structure on a rocky elevation in a spacious and well-wooded park; Sir Robert Smirke
has restored it.

THE MENAI STRAIT.

Still journeying westward, we come to Caernarvonshire, and reach the remarkable estuary dividing
the mainland from the island of Anglesea, and known as the Menai Strait. This narrow stream,
with its steeply-sloping banks and winding shores, looks more like a river than a strait, and
it everywhere discloses evidence of the residence of an almost pre-historic people in relics
of nations that inhabited its banks before the invasion of the Romans. There are hill-forts,
sepulchral mounds, pillars of stone, rude pottery, weapons of stone and bronze; and in that
early day Mona itself, as Anglesea was called, was a sacred island. Here were fierce struggles
between Roman and Briton, and Tacitus tells of the invasion of Mona by the Romans and the desperate
conflicts that ensued as early as A.D. 60. The history of the strait is a story of almost unending
war for centuries, and renowned castles bearing the scars of these conflicts keep watch and
ward to this day. Beaumaris, Bangor, Caernarvon, and Conway castles still remain in partial
ruin to remind us of the Welsh wars of centuries ago. On the Anglesea shore, at the northern
entrance to the strait, is the picturesque ruin of Beaumaris Castle, built by Edward I. at
a point where vessels could conveniently land. It stands on the lowlands, and a canal connects
its ditch with the sea. It consists of a hexagonal line of outer defences surrounding an inner
square. Round towers flanked the outer walls, and the chapel within is quite well preserved.
It has not had much place in history, and the neighboring town is now a peaceful watering-place.

Across the strait is Bangor, a rather straggling town, with a cathedral that is not very old.
We are told that its bishop once sold its peal of bells, and, going down to the shore to see
them shipped away, was stricken blind as a punishment for the sacrilege. Of Bangor Castle,
as it originally stood, but insignificant traces remain, but Lord Penrhyn has recently erected
in the neighborhood the imposing castle of Penryhn, a massive pile of dark limestone, in which
the endeavor is made to combine a Norman feudal castle with a modern dwelling, though with
only indifferent success, excepting in the expenditure involved. The roads from the great suspension-bridge
across the strait lead on either hand to Bangor and Beaumaris, although the route is rather
circuitous. This bridge, crossing at the narrowest and most beautiful part of the strait, was
long regarded as the greatest triumph of bridge-engineering. It carried the Holyhead high-road
across the strait, and was built by Telford. The bridge is five hundred and seventy-nine feet
long, and stands one hundred feet above high-water mark; it cost $600,000. Above the bridge
the strait widens, and here, amid the swift-flowing currents, the famous whitebait are caught
for the London epicures. Three-quarters of a mile below, at another narrow place, the railway
crosses the strait through Stephenson's Britannia tubular bridge, which is more useful than
ornamental, the railway passing through two long rectangular iron tubes, supported on plain
massive pillars. From a rock in the strait the central tower rises to a height of two hundred
and thirty feet, and other towers are built on each shore at a distance of four hundred and
sixty feet from the central one. Couchant lions carved in stone guard the bridge-portals at
each end, and this famous viaduct cost over $2,500,000. A short distance below the Anglesea
Column towers above a dark rock on the northern shore of the strait. It was erected in honor
of the first Marquis of Anglesea, the gallant commander of the British light cavalry at Waterloo,
where his leg was carried away by one of the last French cannon-shots. For many years after
the great victory he lived here, literally with "one foot in the grave." Plas Newydd, one and
a half miles below, the Anglesea family residence, where the marquis lived, is a large and
unattractive mansion, beautifully situated on the sloping shore. It has in the park two ancient
sepulchral monuments of great interest to the antiquarian.

CAERNARVON AND CONWAY.

As the famous strait widens below the bridges the shores are tamer, and we come to the famous
Caernarvon Castle, the scene of many stirring military events, as it held the key to the valleys
of Snowdon, and behind it towers that famous peak, the highest mountain in Britain, whose summit
rises to a height of 3590 feet. This great castle also commanded the south-western entrance
to the strait, and near it the rapid little Sciont River flows into the sea. The ancient Britons
had a fort here, and afterwards it was a Roman fortified camp, which gradually developed into
the city of Segontium. The British name, from which the present one comes, was Caer-yn-Arvon--"the
castle opposite to Mona." Segontium had the honor of being the birthplace of the Emperor Constantine,
and many Roman remains still exist there. It was in 1284, however, that Edward I. began building
the present castle, and it took thirty-nine years to complete. The castle plan is an irregular
oval, with one side overlooking the strait. At the end nearest the sea, where the works come
to a blunt point, is the famous Eagle Tower, which has eagles sculptured on the battlements.
There are twelve towers altogether, and these, with the light-and dark-hued stone in the walls,
give the castle a massive yet graceful aspect as it stands on the low ground at the mouth of
the Sciont. Externally, the castle is in good preservation, but the inner buildings are partly
destroyed, as is also the Queen's Gate, where Queen Eleanor is said to have entered before
the first English Prince of Wales was born. A corridor, with loopholes contrived in the thickness
of the walls, runs entirely around the castle, and from this archers could fight an approaching
enemy. This great fortress has been called the "boast of North Wales" from its size and excellent
position. It was last used for defence during the Civil Wars, having been a military stronghold
for nearly four centuries. Although Charles II. issued a warrant for its demolition, this was
to a great extent disregarded. Prynne, the sturdy Puritan, was confined here in Charles I.'s
time, and the first English Prince of Wales, afterwards the unfortunate Edward II., is said
to have been born in a little dark room, only twelve by eight feet, in the Eagle Tower: when
seventeen years of age the prince received the homage of the Welsh barons at Chester. The town
of Caernarvon, notwithstanding its famous history and the possession of the greatest ruin in
Wales, now derives its chief satisfaction from the lucrative but prosaic occupation of trading
in slates.

At the northern extremity of Caernarvon county, and projecting into the Irish Sea, is the promontory
known as Great Orme's Head, and near it is the mouth of the Conway River. The railway to Holyhead
crosses this river on a tubular bridge four hundred feet long, and runs almost under the ruins
of Conway Castle, another Welsh stronghold erected by Edward I. We are told that this despotic
king, when he had completed the conquest of Wales, came to Conway, the shape of the town being
something like a Welsh harp, and he ordered all the native bards to be put to death. Gray founded
upon this his ode, "The Bard," beginning--

  "On a rock whose lofty brow
    Frowns o'er old Conway's foaming flood,
  Robed in a sable garb of woe.
    With haggard eyes the poet stood."

This ode has so impressed the Conway folk that they have been at great pains to discover the
exact spot where the despairing bard plunged into the river, and several enthusiastic persons
have discovered the actual site. The castle stands upon a high rock, and its builder soon after
its completion was besieged there by the Welsh, but before being starved into submission was
relieved by the timely arrival of a fleet with provisions. It was in the hall of Conway Castle
that Richard II. signed his abdication. The castle was stormed and taken by Cromwell's troops
in the Civil Wars, and we are told that all the Irish found in the garrison were tied in couples,
back to back, and thrown into the river. The castle was not dismantled, but the townsfolk in
their industrious quarrying of slates have undermined one of the towers, which, though kept
up by the solidity of the surrounding masonry, is known as the "Broken Tower." There was none
of the "bonus building" of modern times attempted in these ponderous Welsh castles of the great
King Edward. The ruins are an oblong square, standing on the edge of a steep rock washed on
two sides by the river; the embattled walls, partly covered by ivy, are twelve to fifteen feet
thick, and are flanked by eight huge circular towers, each forty feet in diameter; the interior
is in partial ruin, but shows traces of its former magnificence; the stately hall is one hundred
and thirty feet long. The same architect designed both Caernarvon and Conway. A fine suspension-bridge
now crosses the river opposite the castle, its towers being built in harmony with the architecture
of the place, so that the structure looks much like a drawbridge for the fortress. Although
the Conway River was anciently a celebrated pearl-fishery, slate-making, as at Caernarvon,
is now the chief industry of the town.

There are many other historic places in Caernarvonshire, and also splendid bits of rural and
coast scenery, while the attractions for the angler as well as the artist are almost limitless.
One of the prettiest places for sketching, as well as a spot where the fisherman's skill is
often rewarded, is Bettws-y-Coed. This pretty village, which derives its name from a religious
establishment--"Bede-house in the Wood"--that was formerly there, but long ago disappeared,
is a favorite resort for explorations of the ravines leading down from Mount Snowdon, which
towers among the clouds to the southward. Not far away are the attractive Falls of the Conway,
and from a rock above them is a good view of the wonderful ravine of Fors Noddyn, through which
the river flows. Around it there is a noble assemblage of hills and headlands. Here, joining
with the Conway, comes through another ravine the pretty Machno in a succession of sparkling
cascades and rapids. Not far away is the wild and lovely valley of the Lledr, another tributary
of the Conway, which comes tumbling down a romantic fissure cut into the frowning sides of
the mountain. At Dolwyddelan a solitary tower is all that remains of the castle, once commanding
from its bold perch on the rocks the narrow pass in the valley. It is at present a little village
of slate-quarriers. The Llugwy is yet another attractive tributary of the Conway, which boasts
in its course the Rhavadr-y-Wenol, or the Swallow Fall. This, after a spell of rainy weather,
is considered the finest cataract in Wales for the breadth and volume of the water that descends,
though not for its height. This entire region is full of charming scenery, and of possibly
what some may love even better, good trout-fishing. Following the Conway Valley still farther
up, and crossing over the border into Denbigh, we come to the little market-town of Llanrwst.
It contains two attractive churches, the older one containing many curious monuments and some
good carvings, the latter having been brought from Maenant Abbey. But the chief curiosity of
this little Welsh settlement is the bridge crossing the Conway. It was constructed by Inigo
Jones, and is a three-arched stone bridge, which has the strange peculiarity that by pushing
a particular portion of the parapet it can be made to vibrate from one end to the other. Gwydyr
House, the seat of Lord Willoughby de Eresby, is in the neighborhood, a small part of the original
mansion built in 1555 remaining. Near Trefriw lived Taliesin, the father of Welsh poetry, and
a monument erected by that nobleman on the river-bank perpetuates his memory.

The recollection among the Welsh of the life and exploits of the great chieftain of former
times, Madoc, is held very dear in Caernarvonshire, and is preserved not only in many legends,
but also in the thriving and pleasant little seaport known as Port Madoc, which has grown up
out of the slate-trade. Its wharf is a wilderness of slates, and much of the land in the neighborhood
has been recovered from the sea. The geology as well as the scenery here is an interesting
study. In fact, the whole Caernarvon coast, which stretches away to the south-west in the long
peninsula that forms Cardigan Bay, is full of pleasant and attractive locations for student
and tourist, and entwined around all are weird legends of the heroes and doings of the mystical
days of the dim past, when Briton and Roman contended for the mastery of this historic region.

THE COAST OF MERIONETH.

Let us make a brief excursion south of Mount Snowdon, along the coast of the pastoral county
of Merioneth, where Nature has put many crags and stones and a little gold and wheat, but where
the people's best reliance is their flocks. At the place where the Mawddach joins the sea is
Barmouth, where a fishing-village has of late years bloomed into a fashionable watering-place.
The houses are built on a strip of sand and the precipitous hillside beyond, and the cottages
are perched wherever they can conveniently hold on to the crags, the devious pathways and flights
of steps leading up to them presenting a quaint aspect. The bends of the Mawddach, as it goes
inland among the hills, present miles of unique scenery, the great walls of Cader Idris closing
the background. Several hilltops in the neighborhood contain fortifications, and are marked
by the old tombs known as cromlechs and Druids' altars. On the sea-coast curious reefs project,
the chief of them being St. Patrick's Causeway. The legend tells us that a Welsh chieftain
fifteen hundred years ago constructed these reefs to protect the lowlands from the incursions
of the sea, and on the lands thus reclaimed there stood no less than twelve fortified Welsh
cities. But, unfortunately, one stormy night the guardian of the embankments got drunk, and,
slumbering at the critical moment, the waves rushed in, sweeping all before them. In the morning,
where had before been fortified cities and a vast population, there was only a waste of waters.
St. Patrick, we are told, used his causeway to bear him dryshod as far as possible when he
walked the waters to Ireland.

Let us penetrate into the interior by going up the romantic valley of the Mawddach and viewing
the frowning sides of the chief Merioneth mountain, Cader Idris, which towers on the right
hand to the height of 3100 feet. It is a long ridge rather than a peak, and steep precipices
guard the upper portion. Two little lakes near the summit, enclosed by cliffs, afford magnificent
scenery. Here is "Idris's Chair," where the grim magician, who used to make the mountain his
home, sat to perform his incantations, whilst in a hollow at the summit he had his couch. According
to Welsh tradition, whoever passed the night there would emerge in the morning either mad or
a poet. This mountain, like Snowdon, is said to have been formerly a volcano, and legends tell
of the fiery outbursts that came from its craters, now occupied by the two little lakes. But
the truth of these legends, though interwoven into Welsh poetry, is denied by prosaic geologists.
A rough and steep track, known as the "Fox's Path," leads to the summit, and there is a fine
view northward across the valleys to the distant summits of Snowdon and its attendant peaks,
while spread at our feet to the westward is the broad expanse of Cardigan Bay. Lakes abound
in the lowlands, and, pursuing the road up the Mawddach we pass the "Pool of the Three Pebbles."
Once upon a time three stones got into the shoe of the giant Idris as he was walking about
his domain, and he stopped here and threw them out. Here they still remain--three ponderous
boulders--in the lake.

We leave the Mawddach and follow its tributary, the little river Wnion, as it ripples along
over its pebbly bed guarded by strips of meadow. Soon we come to the lovely "Village of the
Hazels," Dolgelly, standing in the narrow valley, and probably the prettiest spot in Wales.
Steep hills rise on either hand, with bare craggy summits and the lower slopes richly wooded.
Deep dells running into the hills vary the scenery, and thus the town is set in an amphitheatre
of hills, up whose flanks the houses seem to climb. There is a little old church, and in a
back court the ruins of the "Parliament House," where Owen Glendower assembled the Welsh Parliament
in 1404. The Torrent Walk, where the stream from the mountain is spanned by picturesque bridges,
is a favorite resort of the artist, and also one of the most charming bits of scenery in the
neighborhood of this beautiful town. Pursuing the valley farther up and crossing the watershed,
we come to the largest inland water of Wales, the beautiful Bala Lake, heretofore referred
to in describing the river Dee, which drains it. It is at an elevation of six hundred feet,
surrounded by mountain-peaks, and the possibility of making it available as a water-supply
for London has been considered.

There is an attractive place on the Merioneth coast to the southward of Barmouth, at the mouth
of the Rheidol, and near the estuary of the river Dovey. A ruined tower on a low eminence guards
the harbor, where now is a fashionable watering-place, and is almost all that remains of the
once powerful Aberystwith Castle, another stronghold of King Edward I. Portions of the entrance-gate
and barbican can be traced, while the modern houses of the town are spread to the northward
along the semicircular bay. The University College of Wales is located here, and the town is
popularly known as the "Welsh Brighton," while among its antiquities in the suburbs is the
ruined castellated mansion of Plas Crug, said to have been Glendower's home. On the northern
part of the Merioneth coast is the entrance to the pleasant vale of Pfestiniog, another attractive
spot to tourists. Tan-y-bwlch and Maentwrog are romantic villages adjoining each other in this
pretty valley full of waterfalls, among these being the renowned Black Cataract and the Raven Fall.

About twelve miles north of Barmouth the picturesque Harlech Castle stands on a promontory
guarding the entrance to the Traeth. The cliff is precipitous, with just enough level surface
on the top to accommodate the castle. The place is a quadrangle, with massive round towers
at the corners connected by lofty curtain-walls. Circular towers, protected by a barbican,
guard the entrance on the land side. Deep ditches cut in the rock surround the castle where
that defence is necessary. From this fortress on the Rock of Harlech the view is magnificent.
This crag is said to have supported a castle as early as the third century, when Lady Bronwen
built it, and, being of most sensitive honor, died afterwards of grief because her husband
had struck her. Unhappily, she was in advance of her age in her demonstration of woman's rights.
Another castle replaced the first one in the sixth century, and some of its ruins were worked
into the present castle, which is another achievement of the great Welsh fortress-builder,
Edward I. It has stood several sieges. Owen Glendower held it five years against the English.
When Edward IV. became king, Harlech still held out for the Lancastrian party, the redoubtable
Welshman, David ap Ifon, being the governor. Summoned to surrender, the brave David replied,
"I held a town in France till all the old women in Wales heard of it, and now I will hold a
castle in Wales till all the old women in France hear of it." But David was starved into surrender,
and then Edward IV. tried to break the terms of capitulation made by Sir Richard Pembroke,
the besieger. Sir Richard, more generous, told the king, "Then, by Heaven, I will let David
and his garrison into Harlech again, and Your Highness may fetch him out by any who can, and
if you demand my life for his, take it." The song of "The March of the Men of Harlech" is a
memorial of this siege. Harlech was the last Welsh fortress during the Civil Wars that held
out for Charles I., and since then it has been gradually falling to decay.

We have now conducted the tourist to the chief objects in North Wales. The railway runs on
to Holyhead, built on the extreme point of Holy Island on the western verge of Anglesea, where
there is a fine harbor of refuge, lighthouses, and an excellent port. Here comes the "Wild
Irishman," as the fast train is called that runs between London and Ireland, and its passengers
are quickly transferred to the swift steamers that cross the Channel to Dublin harbor. Lighthouses
dot the cliffs on the coast, and at this romantic outpost we will close the survey of North Wales.

LANCASHIRE.

The great manufacturing county of England for cotton and woollen spinning and weaving is Lancashire.
Liverpool is the seaport for the vast aggregation of manufacturers who own the huge mills of
Manchester, Salford, Warrington, Wigan, Oldham, Rochdale, Bolton, Blackburn, Preston, and a
score of other towns, whose operatives work into yarns and fabrics the millions of bales of
cotton and wool that come into the Mersey. The warehouse and factory, with the spinners' cottages
and the manufacturers' villas, make up these towns, almost all of modern growth, and the busy
machinery and smoking chimneys leave little chance for romance in Southern Lancashire. It was
in this section that trade first compelled the use of modern improvements: here were used the
earliest steam-engines; here labored Arkwright to perfect the spinning machinery, and Stephenson
to build railways. To meet the necessities of communication between Liverpool and Manchester,
the first canal was dug in England, and this was followed afterwards by the first experimental
railway; the canal was constructed by Brindley, and was called the "Grand Trunk Canal," being
twenty-eight miles long from Manchester to the Mersey River, at Runcorn above Liverpool, and
was opened in 1767. The railway was opened in 1830; the odd little engine, the "Rocket," then
drew an excursion-train over it, and the opening was marred by an accident which killed Joseph
Huskisson, one of the members of Parliament for Liverpool. Let us follow this railway, which
now carries an enormous traffic out of Liverpool, eastward along the valley of the Mersey past
Warrington, with its quaint old timbered market-house, and then up its tributary, the Irwell,
thirty-one miles to Manchester.

MANCHESTER.

The chief manufacturing city of England has not a striking effect upon the visitor as he approaches
it. It is scattered over a broad surface upon a gently undulating plain, and its suburbs straggle
out into the country villages, which it is steadily absorbing in its rapid growth; the Irwell
passes in a winding course through the city, receiving a couple of tributaries; this river
divides Manchester from Salford, but a dozen bridges unite them. No city in England has had
such rapid growth as Manchester in this century; it has increased from about seventy thousand
people at the beginning of the century to over half a million now; and this is all the effect
of the development of manufacturing industry. Yet Manchester is one of the oldest towns in
England, for there was a Roman camp at Mancunium, as the Cæsars called it, in the first century
of the Christian era; and we are also told that in the days when giants lived in England it
was the scene of a terrific combat between Sir Launcelot of the Lake and the giant Tarquin.
A ballad tells the story, but it is easier read in prose: Sir Launcelot was travelling near
Manchester when he heard that this giant held in durance vile a number of knights--"threescore
and four" in all; a damsel conducts him to the giant's castle-gate, "near Manchester, fair
town," where a copper basin hung to do duty as a bell; he strikes it so hard as to break it,
when out comes the giant ready for the fray; a terrific combat ensues, and the giant, finding
that he has met his match, offers to release the captives, provided his adversary is not a
certain knight that slew his brother. Unfortunately, it happens that Sir Launcelot is the very
same, and the combat is renewed with such vigor that the giant is slain, "to the great contentment
of many persons."

The ancient Mancunium was a little camp and city of about twelve acres, partly bounded by a
tributary of the Irwell known as the Medlock. A ditch on the land-side was still visible in
the last century, and considerable portions of the old Roman walls also remained within two
hundred years. Many Roman relics have been discovered in the city, and at Knott Mill, the site
of the giant Tarquin's castle, a fragment of the Roman wall is said to be still visible. The
town in the early Tudor days had a college, and then a cathedral, and it was besieged in the
Civil Wars, though it steadily grew, and in Charles II.'s time it was described as a busy and
opulent place; but it had barely six thousand people. Cotton-spinning had then begun, the cotton
coming from Cyprus and Smyrna. In 1700 life in Manchester, as described in a local guide-book,
was noted by close application to business; the manufacturers were in their warehouses by six
in the morning, breakfasted at seven on bowls of porridge and milk, into which masters and
apprentices dipped their spoons indiscriminately, and dined at twelve; the ladies went out
visiting at two in the afternoon, and attended church at four. Manchester was conservative
in the Jacobite rebellion, and raised a regiment for the Pretender, but the royalist forces
defeated it, captured the officers, and beheaded them.

It was the rapid growth of manufacturing industry in Manchester that changed its politics,
and it was here that was first conspicuously advocated the free-trade agitation in England
which triumphed in the repeal of the Corn Laws, so as to admit food free of duty for the operatives,
and in the Reform bill that changed the representation in Parliament. That fine building, the
"Free-Trade Hall," is a monument of this agitation in which Manchester took such prominent
part. As the city has grown in wealth, so has its architectural appearance improved; its school-and
college-buildings are very fine, particularly Owens College, munificently endowed by a leading
merchant. The Manchester Cathedral is an ancient building overlooking the Irwell which has
had to be renewed in so many parts that it has a comparatively modern aspect. Other English
cathedrals are more imposing, but this, "the ould paroch church" spoken of by the ancient chroniclers,
is highly prized by the townsfolk; the architecture is Perpendicular and of many dates. Until
recently this was the only parish church in Manchester, and consequently all the marriages
for the city had to be celebrated there; the number was at times very large, especially at
Easter, and not a few tales are told of how, in the confusion, the wrong pairs were joined
together, and when the mistake was discovered respliced with little ceremony. It was in this
Manchester Cathedral that one rector is said to have generally begun the marriage service by
instructing the awaiting crowd to "sort yourselves in the vestry."

Some of the public buildings in Manchester are most sumptuous. The Assize Courts are constructed
in rich style, with lofty Pointed roofs and a tall tower, and make one of the finest modern
buildings in England. The great hall is a grand apartment, and behind the courts is the prison,
near which the Fenians in 1867 made the celebrated rescue of the prisoners from the van for
which some of the assailants were hanged and others transported. The Royal Exchange is a massive
structure in the Italian style, with a fine portico, dome, and towers; the hall within is said
to be probably the largest room in England, having a width of ceiling, without supports, of
one hundred and twenty feet. Here on cotton-market days assemble the buyers and sellers from
all the towns in Lancashire, and they do an enormous traffic. The new Town-Hall is also a fine
building, where the departments of the city government are accommodated, and where they have
an apartment dear to every Englishman's heart--"a kitchen capable of preparing a banquet for
eight hundred persons." The warehouses of Manchester are famous for their size and solidity,
and could Arkwright come back and see what his cotton-spinning machinery has produced, he would
be amazed. It was in Manchester that the famous Dr. Dalton, the founder of the atomic theory
in chemistry, lived; he was a devout Quaker, like so many of the townspeople, but unfortunately
was color-blind; he appeared on one occasion in a scarlet waistcoat, and when taken to task
declared it seemed to him a very quiet, unobtrusive color, just like his own coat. Several
fine parks grace the suburbs of Manchester, and King Cotton has made this thriving community
the second city in England, while for miles along the beautifully shaded roads that lead into
the suburbs the opulent merchants and manufacturers have built their ornamental villas.

FURNESS AND STONYHURST

The irregularly-shaped district of Lancashire partly cut off from the remainder of the county
by an arm of the Irish Sea is known as Furness. It is a wild and rugged region, best known
from the famous Furness Abbey and its port of Barrow-in-Furness, one of the most remarkable
examples in England of quick city growth. Forty years ago this was an insignificant fishing
village; now Barrow has magnificent docks and a fine harbor protected by the natural breakwater
of Walney Island, great iron-foundries and the largest jute-manufactory in the world; while
it has recently also became a favorite port for iron shipbuilding. About two miles distant,
and in a romantic glen called the Valley of Deadly Nightshade, not far from the sea, is one
of the finest examples of mediæval church-architecture in England, the ruins of Furness Abbey,
founded in the twelfth century by King Stephen and Maud, his queen. It was a splendid abbey,
standing high in rank and power, its income in the reign of Edward I. being $90,000 a year,
an enormous sum for that early day. The ruins are in fine preservation, and effigies of Stephen
and Maud are on each side of the great east window. For twelve reigns the charters of sovereigns
and bulls of popes confirmed the abbots of Furness in their extraordinary powers, which extended
over the district of Furness, while the situation of the abbey made them military chieftains,
and they erected a watch-tower on a high hill, from which signals alarmed the coast on the
approach of an enemy. The church is three hundred and four feet long, and from the centre rose
a tower, three of the massive supporting pillars of which remain, but the tower has fallen
and lies a mass of rubbish; the stained glass from the great east window having been removed
to Bowness Church, in Westmorelandshire. The abbey enclosure, covering eighty-five acres, was
surrounded by a wall, the ruins of which are now covered with thick foliage. This renowned
abbey was surrendered and dismantled in Henry VIII.'s reign; the present hotel near the ruins
was formerly the abbot's residence.

The river Ribble, which flows into the Irish Sea through a wide estuary, drains the western
slopes of the Pennine Hills, which divide Lancashire from Yorkshire. Up in the north-western
portion of Lancashire, near the bases of these hills, is a moist region known as the parish
of Mitton, where, as the poet tells us,

  "The Hodder, the Calder, Ribble, and rain
  All meet together in Mitton domain."

In Mitton parish, amid the woods along the Hodder and on the north side of the valley of the
Ribble, stands the splendid domed towers of the baronial edifice of Stonyhurst, now the famous
Jesuit College of England, where the sons of the Catholic nobility and gentry are educated.
The present building is about three hundred years old, and quaint gardens adjoin it, while
quite an extensive park surrounds the college. Not far away are Clytheroe Castle and the beautiful
ruins of Whalley Abbey. The Stonyhurst gardens are said to remain substantially as their designer,
Sir Nicholas Sherburne, left them. A capacious water-basin is located in the centre, with the
leaden statue of Regulus in chains standing in the midst of the water. Summer-houses with tall
pointed roofs are at each lower extremity of the garden, while an observatory is upon a commanding
elevation. Tall screens of clipped yews, cut square ten feet high and five feet thick, divide
the beds upon one side of the gardens, so that as you walk among them you are enveloped in
a green yet pleasant solitude. Arched doorways are cut through the yews, and in one place,
descending by broad and easy steps, there is a solemn, cool, and twilight walk formed by the
overarching yews, the very place for religious meditation. Then, reascending, this sombre walk
opens into air and sunshine amid delicious flower-gardens. On the opposite side of the gardens
are walls hung with fruit, and plantations of kitchen vegetables. This charming place was fixed
upon by the Jesuits for their college in 1794, when driven from Liège by the proscriptions
of the French Revolution. The old building and the additions then erected enclose a large quadrangular
court. In the front of the college, at the southern angle, is a fine little Gothic church,
built fifty years ago. The college refectory is a splendid baronial hall. In the Mitton village-church
near by are the tombs of the Sherburne family, the most singular monument being that to Sir
Richard and his lady, which the villagers point out as "old Fiddle o' God and his wife"--Fiddle
o' God being his customary exclamation when angry, which tradition says was not seldom. The
figures are kneeling--he in ruff and jerkin, she in black gown and hood, with tan-leather gloves
extending up her arms. These figures, being highly colored, as was the fashion in the olden
time, have a ludicrous appearance. We are told that when these monuments came from London they
were the talk of the whole country round. A stonemason bragged that he could cut out as good
a figure in common stone. Taken at his word, he was put to the test, and carved the effigy
of a knight in freestone which so pleased the Sherburne family that they gave him one hundred
dollars for it, and it is now set in the wall outside the church, near the monuments.

LANCASTER CASTLE.

John of Gaunt, "time-honored Lancaster," was granted the Duchy of Lancaster by his father,
King Edward III., but the place which stands upon the river Lune is of much greater antiquity.
It was a Roman camp, and hence its name. The Picts destroyed it when the Romans left; the Saxons
afterwards restored it, and ultimately it gave the name to the county. King John gave the town
a charter, and John of Gaunt rebuilt the fortress, which became indissolubly connected with
the fortunes of the House of Lancaster. Though sometimes besieged, it was maintained more for
purposes of state than of war, and two centuries ago it still existed in all its ancient splendor,
commanding the city and the sea. Lancaster stands on the slope of an eminence rising from the
river Lune, and the castle-towers crown the summit, the fortress being spacious, with a large
courtyard and variously-shaped towers. The keep is square, enormously strong, and defended
by two semi-octagonal towers. This keep is known as "John of Gaunt's Chair," and commands a
fine view of the surrounding country and far away across the sea to the distant outlines of
the Isle of Man. This famous castle, partly modernized, is now used for the county jail and
courts, the prison-chapel being in the keep. In the town several large manufactories attest
the presiding genius of Lancashire, and the inn is the comfortable and old-fashioned King's
Arms described by Dickens.

ISLE OF MAN.

Let us go off from the Lancashire coast to that strange island which lies in the sea midway
between England, Scotland, and Ireland, and whose bold shores are visible from "John of Gaunt's
Chair." It stretches for thirty-three miles from its northern extremity at the point of Ayre
to the bold detached cliffs of the little islet at the southern end known as the Calf of Man.
Covering two hundred and twenty-seven square miles area, its coasts are irregular, its shores
in several places precipitous, and a range of mountains traverses the entire island, the highest
peak being Snaefell, rising 2024 feet, with North Barrule at one extremity and Cronk-ny-Jay
Llaa, or "The Hill of the Rising Day," at the other. Man is a miniature kingdom, with its reproduction,
sometimes in dwarf, of everything that other kingdoms have. It has four little rivers, the
Neb, Colby, Black and Gray Waters, with little gems of cascades; has its own dialect, the Manx,
and a parliament in miniature, known as the Council, or Upper House, and the House of Keys.
It is a healthful resort, for all the winds that blow come from the sea, and its sea-views
are striking, the rugged masses of Bradda Head, the mellow-coloring of the Calf, and the broad
expanse of waters, dotted by scores of fishing-boats, making many scenes of artistic merit.
While the want of trees makes the land-views harsh and cold, yet the glens and coves opening
into the sea are the charms of Manx scenery, the high fuchsia-hedges surrounding many of the
cottages giving bright coloring to the landscape when the flowers are in bloom. It is a beautiful
place when once the tourist is able to land there, but the wharf arrangements are not so good
as they might be. Once landed, the visitor usually first proceeds to solve the great zoological
problem the island has long presented to the outer world, and finds that the Isle of Man does
really possess a breed of tailless cats, whose caudal extremity is either altogether wanting
or at most is reduced to a merely rudimental substitute.

CASTLE RUSHEN.

Landing at the capital, Castletown, it is found that it gets its name from the ancient castle
of Rushen, around which the town is built. Guttred the Dane is said to have built this castle
nine hundred years ago, and to be buried beneath it, although Cardinal Wolsey constructed the
surrounding stone glacis. The keep--into which the prisoners had to be lowered by ropes--and
several parts of the interior buildings remain almost entire, but repeated sieges so wrecked
the other portions that they have had to be restored. At the castle-entrance were stone chairs
for the governor and judges. It was here that the eminent men who have ruled the Isle of Man
presided, among them being Regulus, who was King of Man, and the famous Percy, who was attainted
of high treason in 1403. Afterwards it was ruled by the Earls of Derby, who relinquished the
title of king and took that of Lord of Man, holding their sovereignty until they sold it and
the castles and patronage of the island to the Crown in 1764 for $350,000. With such a history
it is natural that Castle Rushen should have a weird interest attached to it, and the ancient
chroniclers tell of a mysterious apartment within "which has never been opened in the memory
of man." Tradition says that this famous castle was first inhabited by fairies, and afterwards
by the giants, until Merlin, by his magic power, dislodged most of the giants and bound the
others in spells. In proof of this it is said there are fine apartments underneath the ground,
to explore which several venturesome persons have gone down, only one of whom ever returned.
To save the lives of the reckless would be explorers, therefore, this mysterious apartment,
which gives entrance underground, is kept shut. The one who returned is described as an "explorer
of uncommon courage," who managed to get back by the help of a clue of packthread which he
took with him, and was thus able to retrace his steps. He had a wondrous tale to tell. After
passing a number of vaults, and through a long, narrow passage which descended for more than
a mile, he saw a little gleam of light, and gladly sought it out. The light came from a magnificent
house, brilliantly illuminated. Having "well fortified himself with brandy before beginning
the exploration," he courageously knocked at the door, and at the third knock a servant appeared,
demanding what was wanted. He asked for directions how to proceed farther, as the house seemed
to block the passage. The servant, after some parley, led him through the house and out at
the back door. He walked a long distance, and then beheld another house, more magnificent than
the first, where, the windows being open, he saw innumerable lamps burning in all the rooms.
He was about to knock, but first had the curiosity to peep through a window into the parlor.
There was a large black marble table in the middle of the room, and on it lay at full length
a giant who, the explorer says, was "at least fourteen feet long and ten feet round the body."
The giant lay with his head pillowed on a book, as if asleep, and there was a prodigious sword
alongside him, proportioned to the hand that was to use it. This sight was so terrifying that
the explorer made the best of his way back to the first house, where the servant told him that
if he had knocked at the giant's door he would have had company enough, but would have never
returned. He desired to know what place it was, but was told, "These things are not to be revealed."
Then he made his way back to daylight by the aid of the clue of packthread as quickly as possible,
and we are told that no one has ventured down there since. This is but one of the many tales
of mystery surrounding the venerable Rushen Castle.

PEELE CASTLE.

The Isle of Man derives its name from the ancient British word mon, which means "isolated."
Around this singular place there are many rocky islets, also isolated, and upon one of the
most picturesque of these, where art and Nature have vied in adding strength to beauty, is
built the castle of Peele, off the western coast, overlooking the distant shores of Ireland.
This castle is perched upon a huge rock, rising for a great height out of the sea, and completely
inaccessible, except by the approach which has been constructed on the side towards the Isle
of Man, where the little town of Peele is located. After crossing the arm of the sea separating
the castle from the town, the visitor, landing at the foot of the rock, ascends about sixty
steps, cut out of it, to the first wall, which is massive and high, and built of the old red
sandstone in which the island abounds; the gates in this wall are of wood, curiously arched
and carved, and four little watch-towers on the wall overlook the sea. Having entered, he mounts
by another shorter stairway cut out of the rock to the second wall, built like the other, and
both of them full of portholes for cannon. Passing through yet a third wall, there is found
a broad plain upon the top of the rock, where stands the castle, surrounded by four churches,
three almost entirely ruined; the other church (St. Germain's) is kept in some repair because
it has within the bishop's chapel, while beneath is a horrible dungeon where the sea runs in
and out through hollows of the rock with a continual roar; a steep and narrow stairway descends
to the dungeon and burial-vaults, and within are thirteen pillars supporting the chapel above.
Beware, if going down, of failing to count the pillars, for we are told that he who neglects
this is sure to do something that will occasion his confinement in this dreadful dungeon. This
famous castle of Peele even in its partly-ruined state has several noble apartments, and here
were located some of the most interesting scenes of Scott's novel of Peveril of the Peak. It
was in former days a state-prison, and in it were at one time confined Warwick the King-maker,
and also Gloucester's haughty wife, Eleanor; her discontented spectre was said to haunt the
battlements in former years, and stand motionless beside one of the watch-towers, only disappearing
when the cock crew or church-bell tolled: another apparition, a shaggy spaniel known as the
Manthe Doog, also haunted the castle, particularly the guard-chamber, where the dog came and
lay down at candlelight; the soldiers lost much of their terror by the frequency of the sight,
but none of them liked to be left alone with him, though he did not molest them. The dog came
out by a passage through the church where the soldiers had to go to deliver the keys to their
captain, and for moral support they never went that way alone. One of the soldiers, we are
told, on a certain night, "being much disguised in liquor" (for spirits of various kinds appear
in the Isle of Man, as most other places), insisted upon going with the keys alone, and could
not be dissuaded; he said he was determined to discover whether the apparition was dog or devil,
and, snatching the keys, departed: soon there was a great noise, but none ventured to ascertain
the cause. When the soldier returned he was speechless and horror-stricken, nor would he ever
by word or sign tell what had happened to him, but soon died in agony; then the passage was
walled up, and the Manthe Doog was never more seen at Castle Peele.

THE LAKE COUNTRY.

North of Lancashire, in the counties of Westmoreland and Cumberland, is the famous "Lake Country"
of England. It does not cover a large area--in fact, a good pedestrian can walk from one extremity
of the region to the other in a day--but its compact beauties have a charm of rugged outline
and luxuriant detail that in a condensed form reproduce the Alpine lakes of Northern Italy.
Derwentwater is conceded to be the finest of these English lakes, but there is also great beauty
in Windermere and Ulleswater, Buttermere and Wastwater. The Derwent runs like a thread through
the glassy bead of Derwentwater, a magnificent oval lake set among the hills, about three miles
long and half that breadth, alongside which rises the frowning Mount Skiddaw with its pair
of rounded heads. In entering the Lake Region from the Lancashire side we first come to the
pretty Windermere Lake, the largest of these inland sheets of water, about ten miles long and
one mile broad in the widest part. From Orrest Head, near the village of Windermere, there
is a magnificent view of the lake from end to end, though tourists prefer usually to go to
the village of Bowness on the bank, where steamers start at frequent intervals and make the
circuit of the pretty lake. From Bowness the route is by Rydal Mount, where the poet Wordsworth
lived, to Koswick, about twenty-three miles distant, on Derwentwater.

The attractive Derwent flows down through the Borrowdale Valley past Seathwaite, where for
many a year there has been worked a famous mine of plumbago: we use it for lead-pencils, but
our English ancestors, while making it valuable for marking their sheep, prized it still more
highly as a remedy for colic and other human ills. There are several pencil-mills in the village,
which, in addition to other claims for fame, is noted as one of the rainiest spots in England,
the annual rainfall at Seathwaite sometimes reaching one hundred and eighty-two inches. The
Derwent flows on through a gorge past the isolated pyramidal rock known as Castle Crag, and
the famous Bowder Stone, which has fallen into the gorge from the crags above, to the hamlet
of Grange, where a picturesque bridge spans the little river. We are told that the inhabitants
once built a wall across the narrowest part of this valley: having long noticed the coincident
appearance of spring and the cuckoo, they rashly concluded that the latter was the cause of
the former, and that if they could only retain the bird their pleasant valley would enjoy perpetual
spring; they built the wall as spring lengthened into summer, and with the autumn came the
crisis. The wall had risen to a considerable height when the cuckoo with the approach of colder
weather was sounding its somewhat asthmatic notes as it moved from tree to tree down the valley;
it neared the wall, and as the population held their breath it suddenly flew over, and carried
the spring away with it down the Derwent. Judge of the popular disgust when the sages of that
region complainingly remarked that, having crossed but a few inches above the topmost stones
of the wall, if the builders had only carried it a course or two higher the cuckoo might have
been kept at home, and their valley thus have enjoyed a perennial spring.

The Derwent flows on along its gorge, which has been slowly ground out by a glacier in past
ages, and enters the lake through the marshy, flat, reedy delta that rather detracts from the
appearance of its upper end. Not far away a small waterfall comes tumbling over the crags among
the foliage; this miniature Niagara has a fame almost as great as the mighty cataract of the
New World, for it is the "Fall of Lodore," about which, in answer to his little boy's question,
"How does the water come down at Lodore?" Southey wrote his well-known poem that is such a
triumph of versification, and from which this is a quotation:

  "Flying and flinging, writhing and wringing,
  Eddying and whisking, spouting and frisking,
      Turning and twisting
  Around and around, with endless rebound,
  Smiting and fighting, a sight to delight in,
      Confounding, astounding.
  Dizzying and deafening the ear with its sound;
  All at once, and all o'er, with mighty uproar--
  And this way the water conies down at Lodore."

Thus we reach the border of Derwentwater, nestling beneath the fells and crags, as its miniature
surrounding mountains are called. Little wooded islets dimple the surface of the lake, in the
centre being the largest, St. Herbert's Island, where once that saint lived in a solitary cell:
he was the bosom friend of St. Cuthbert, the missionary of Northumberland, and made an annual
pilgrimage over the Pennine Hills to visit him; loving each other in life, in death they were
not divided, for Wordsworth tells us that

  "These holy men both died in the same hour."

Another islet is known as Lord's Island, where now the rooks are in full possession, but where
once was the home of the ill-fated Earl of Derwentwater, who was beheaded in 1716 for espousing
the Pretender's cause. It is related that before his execution on Tower Hill he closely viewed
the block, and finding a rough place which might offend his neck, he bade the headsman chip
it off; this done, he cheerfully placed his head upon it, gave the sign, and died: his estates
were forfeited and settled by the king on Greenwich Hospital. Castle Hill rises boldly on the
shore above Derwent Isle, where there is a pretty residence, and every few years there is added
to the other islets on the bosom of the lake the "Floating Island," a mass of vegetable matter
that becomes detached from the marsh at the upper end. At Friar's Crag, beneath Castle Hill,
the lake begins to narrow, and at Portinscale the Derwent flows out, receives the waters of
the Greta coming from Keswick, and, after flowing a short distance through the meadow-land,
expands again into Bassenthwaite Lake, a region of somewhat tamer yet still beautiful scenery.

The town of Keswick stands some distance back from the border of Derwentwater, and is noted
as having been the residence of Southey. In Greta Hall, an unpretentious house in the town,
Southey lived for forty years, dying there in 1843. He was laid to rest in the parish church
of Crosthwaite, just outside the town. At the pretty little church there is a marble altar-tomb,
the inscription on which to Southey's memory was written by Wordsworth. Greta Hall was also
for three years the home of Coleridge, the two families dwelling under the same roof. Behind
the modest house rises Skiddaw, the bare crags of the rounded summits being elevated over three
thousand feet, and beyond it the hills and moors of the Skiddaw Forest stretch northward to
the Solway, with the Scruffel Hill beyond. Upon a slope of the mountain, not far from Keswick,
is a Druids' circle, whose builders scores of centuries ago watched the mists on Skiddaw's
summit, as the people there do now, to foretell a change of weather as the clouds might rise
or fall, for they tell us that

  "If Skiddaw hath a cap,
  Scruffel wots full well of that."

THE BORDER CASTLES.

At Kendal, in Westmorelandshire, are the ruins of Kendal Castle, a relic of the Norman days,
but long since gone to decay. Here lived the ancestors of King Henry VIII.'s last wife, Queen
Catharine Parr. Opposite it are the ruins of Castle How, and not far away the quaint appendage
known as Castle Dairy, replete with heraldic carvings. It was in the town of Kendal that was
made the foresters' woollen cloth known as "Kendal green," which was the uniform of Robin Hood's
band.

In the northern part of the county, on the military road to Carlisle, are the ruins of Brougham
Castle, built six hundred years ago. It was here that the Earl of Cumberland magnificently
entertained King James I. for three days on one of his journeys out of Scotland. It is famous
as the home of the late Henry, Lord Brougham, whose ancestors held it for many generations.
The manor-house, known as Brougham Hall, has such richness, variety, and extent of prospect
from its terraces that it is called the "Windsor of the North." Lord Brougham was much attached
to his magnificent home, and it was here in 1860 that he finished his comprehensive work on
the British Constitution, and wrote its famous dedication to the queen, beginning with the
memorable words, "Madame, I presume to lay at Your Majesty's feet a work the 'result of many
years' diligent study, much calm reflection, and a long life's experience." In close proximity
to the castle is the Roman station Brocavum, founded by Agricola in A.D. 79. Its outline is
clearly defined, the camp within the inner ditch measuring almost one thousand feet square.
Various Roman roads lead from it, and much of the materials of the outworks were built into
the original Brougham Castle.

The Solway and its firth divide England from Scotland, and this borderland has been the scene
of many deadly feuds, though happily only in the days long agone. The castle of Carlisle was
a noted border stronghold, built of red sandstone by King William Rufus, who rebuilt Carlisle,
which had then lain in ruins two hundred years because of the forays of the Danes. Richard
III. enlarged the castle, and Henry VIII. built the citadel. Here Mary Queen of Scots was once
lodged, but in Elizabeth's time the castle fell into decay. In the town is a fine cathedral,
which has been thoroughly restored. In a flat situation north of Carlisle are the ruins of
Scaleby Castle, once a fortress of great strength, but almost battered to pieces when it resisted
Cromwell's forces. There are several acres enclosed within the moat, intended for the cattle
when driven in to escape the forays that came over the border. This venerable castle is now
a picturesque ruin. Twelve miles north-east of Carlisle is Naworth Castle, near where the Roman
Wall crossed England. This is one of the finest feudal remains in Cumberland, having been the
stronghold of the Wardens of the Marches, who guarded the border from Scottish incursions.
It stands amid fine scenery, and just to the southward is the Roman Wall, of which many remains
are still traced, while upon the high moorland in the neighborhood is the paved Roman Road,
twelve feet wide and laid with stone. At Naworth there was always a strong garrison, for the
border was rarely at peace, and

  "Stern on the angry confines Naworth rose,
  In dark woods islanded; its towers looked forth
  And frowned defiance on the angry North."

Here lived, with a host of retainers, the famous "belted Will"--Lord William Howard, son of
the fourth Duke of Norfolk--who in the early part of the seventeenth century finally brought
peace to the border by his judicious exercise for many years of the Warden's powers. It is
of this famous soldier and chivalrous knight, whose praises are even yet sung in the borderland,
that Scott has written--

            "Howard, than whom knight
  Was never dubbed more bold in fight,
  Nor, when from war and armor free.
  More famed for stately courtesy."

THE PEAK OF DERBYSHIRE.

The river Mersey takes its sources--for it is formed by the union of several smaller streams--in
the ranges of high limestone hills east of Liverpool, in North Derbyshire. These hills are
an extension of the Pennine range that makes the backbone of England, and in Derbyshire they
rise to a height of nearly two thousand feet, giving most picturesque scenery. The broad top
of the range at its highest part is called the Kinderscout, or, more familiarly, "The Peak."
The mountain-top is a vast moor, abounding in deep holes and water-pools, uninhabited excepting
by the stray sportsman or tourist, and dangerous and difficult to cross. Yet, once mounted
to the top, there are good views of the wild scenery of the Derbyshire hills, with the villages
nestling in the glens, and of the "Kinder Fall," where much of the water from the summit pours
down a cataract of some five hundred feet height, while not far away is the "Mermaid's Pool,"
where, if you go at the midnight hour that ushers in Easter Sunday, and look steadily into
the water, you will see a mermaid. The man who ventures upon that treacherous bogland by night
certainly deserves to see the best mermaid the Peak can produce. This limestone region is a
famous place. In the sheltered valley to the westward of the Kinderscout is the village of
Castleton, almost covered in by high hills on all sides. It was here upon a bold cliff to the
southward of the village that "Peveril of the Peak" built his renowned castle at the time of
the Norman Conquest, of which only the ruins of the keep and part of the outer walls remain.
Almost inaccessible, it possessed the extraordinary powers of defence that were necessary in
those troublous times, and here its founder gave a grand tournament, to which young knights
came from far and near, the successful knight of Lorraine being rewarded by his daughter's
hand. In the time of Edward III. this "Castle of the Peak" reverted to the Crown, but now it
is held by the Duke of Devonshire. Under the hill on which the ruins stand is the "Cavern of
the Peak," with a fine entrance in a gloomy recess formed by a chasm in the rocks. This entrance
makes a Gothic arch over one thousand feet wide, above which the rock towers nearly three hundred
feet, and it is chequered with colored stones. Within is a vast flat-roofed cavern, at the
farther side being a lake over which the visitors are ferried in a boat. Other caverns are
within, the entire cave extending nearly a half mile, a little river traversing its full length.
There are more and similar caverns in the neighborhood.

BESS OF HARDWICKE.

One of the great characters of the sixteenth century was Elizabeth, Countess of Shrewsbury,
familiarly known as "Bess of Hardwicke," where she was born, and who managed to outlive four
husbands, thus showing what success is in store for a woman of tact and business talent. She
was a penniless bride at fourteen, when she married an opulent gentleman of Derbyshire named
Barley, who left her at fifteen a wealthy widow. At the age of thirty she married another rich
husband, Sir William Cavendish, the ancestor of the Dukes of Devonshire, who died in 1557,
leaving her again a widow, but with large estates, for she had taken good care to look after
the proper marriage settlements; and in fact, even in those early days, a pretty good fortune
was necessary to provide for the family of eight children Sir William left her. She next married
Sir William Loe, who also had large estates and was the captain of the king's guard, the lady's
business tact procuring in advance of the wedding the settlement of these estates upon herself
and her children--a hard condition, with which, the historian tells us, "the gallant captain,
who had a family by a former marriage, felt himself constrained to comply or forego his bride."
But in time the captain died, and his estates all went to the thrifty lady, to the exclusion
of his own family; and to the blooming widow, thus made for the third time, there came a-courting
the Earl of Shrewsbury; the earl had numerous offspring, and therefore could hardly give Bess
all his possessions, like her other husbands, but she was clever enough to obtain her object
in another way. As a condition precedent to accepting the earl, she made him marry two of his
children to two of hers, and after seeing these two weddings solemnized, the earl led her to
the altar for the fourth time at the age of fifty; and we are told that all four of these weddings
were actual "love-matches." But she did not get on well with the earl, whose correspondence
shows she was a little shrewish, though in most quarrels she managed to come off ahead, having
by that time acquired experience. When the earl died in 1590, and Bess concluded not again
to attempt matrimony, she was immensely rich and was seized with a mania for building, which
has left to the present day three memorable houses: Hardwicke Hall, where she lived, Bolsover
Castle, and the palace of Chatsworth, which she began, and on which she lavished the enormous
sum, for that day, of $400,000. The legend runs that she was told that so long as she kept
building her life would be spared--an architect's ruse possibly; and when finally she died
it was during a period of hard frost, when the masons could not work.

Hardwicke Hall, near Mansfield, which the renowned Bess has left as one of her monuments, is
about three hundred years old, and approached by a noble avenue through a spacious park; it
is still among the possessions of the Cavendish family and in the Duke of Devonshire's estates.
The old hall where Bess was born almost touches the new one that she built, and which bears
the initials of the proud and determined woman in many places outside and in. It was here that
Mary Queen of Scots was held in captivity part of the time that she was placed by Queen Elizabeth
in the custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury, and her statue stands in the hall. There is an extensive
picture-gallery containing many historical portraits, and also fine state-apartments. The mansion
is a lofty oblong stone structure, with tall square towers at each corner, the architecture
being one of the best specimens of the Elizabethan Period; on the side, as viewed from the
park, the hall seems all windows, which accounts for the saying of that neighborhood:

  "Hardwicke Hall, more glass than wall."

The ruins of the old hall, almost overgrown with ivy, are picturesque, but from everywhere
on the ancient or on the modern hall there peer out the initials "E. S.," with which the prudent
Bess was so careful to mark all her possessions.

BOLSOVER CASTLE.

The noted Bolsover Castle, which Bess also built, though her son finished it after her death,
stands in a magnificent position on a high plateau not far from Chesterfield, overlooking a
wide expanse of Derbyshire. The present castle replaced an ancient structure that had fallen
into ruin, and was supposed to have been built by "Peveril of the Peak;" it was fortified during
King John's time, and traces of the fortifications still remain; it was repeatedly besieged
and taken by assault. The present building is a square and lofty mansion of castellated appearance,
with towers at the corners built of brown stone; in it the Earl of Newcastle, who subsequently
inherited it, spent on one occasion $75,000 in entertaining King Charles I., the entire country
round being invited to come and attend the king: Ben Jonson performed a play for his amusement.
Lord Clarendon speaks of the occasion as "such an excess of feasting as had scarce ever been
known in England before." It now belongs to the Duke of Portland, and has fallen into partial
decay, with trees growing in some of the deserted apartments and ivy creeping along the walls.
Visitors describe it as a ghostly house, with long vaulted passages, subterranean chambers,
dungeon-like holes in the towers, and mysterious spaces beneath the vaults whence come weird
noises. When Mr. Jennings visited Bolsover recently he described it as like a haunted house,
and after examining the apartments, in which most things seemed going to decay, he went down
stairs, guided by an old woman, to the cellars and passages that are said to be the remains
of the original Norman castle. A chamber with a high vaulted roof was used as a kitchen, and
an ancient stone passage connected it with a crypt; beneath this, she told him, there was a
church, never opened since the days of Peveril. Their voices had a hollow sound, and their
footsteps awakened echoes as if from a large empty space beneath: the servants, she said, were
afraid to come down where they were, excepting by twos and threes, and she added: "Many people
have seen things here besides me: something bad has been done here, sir, and when they open
that church below they'll find it out. Just where you stand by that door I have several times
seen a lady and gentleman--only for a moment or two, for they come like a flash; when I have
been sitting in the kitchen, not thinking of any such thing, they stood there--the gentleman
with ruffles on, the lady with a scarf round her waist; I never believed in ghosts, but I have
seen them. I am used to it now, and don't mind it, but we do not like the noises, because they
disturb us. Not long ago my husband, who comes here at night, and I could not sleep at all,
and we thought at last that somebody had got shut up in the castle, for some children had been
here that day; so we lit a candle and went all over it, but there was nothing, only the noises
following us, and keeping on worse than ever after we left the rooms, though they stopped while
we were in them." The old woman's tale shows the atmosphere there is about this sombre and
ghostly castle of Bolsover.

THE WYE AND THE DERWENT.

These two noted rivers take their rise in the Derbyshire hills, and, coming together at Rowsley
near the pretty Peacock Inn, flow down to the sea through the valleys of the Wye, the Trent,
and the Humber. Rising in the limestone hills to the north of Buxton, the Wye flows past that
celebrated bath, where the Romans first set the example of seeking its healing waters, both
hot and cold springs gushing from the rocks in close proximity. It stands nine hundred feet
above the sea, its nucleus, "The Crescent," having been built by the Duke of Devonshire; and
the miraculous cures wrought by St. Mary's Well are noted by Charles Cotton among the Wonders
of the Peak. From Buxton the Wye follows a romantic glen to Bakewell, the winding valley being
availed of, by frequent tunnels, viaducts, and embankments, as a route for the Midland Railway.
In this romantic glen is the remarkable limestone crag known as Chee Tor, where the curving
valley contracts into a narrow gorge. The gray limestone cliffs are in many places overgrown
with ivy, while trees find rooting-places in their fissures. Tributary brooks fall into the
Wye, all flowing through miniature dales that disclose successive beauties, and then at a point
where the limestone hills recede from the river, expanding the valley, Bakewell is reached.
Here are also mineral springs, but the most important place in the town is the parish church,
parts of which are seven hundred years old. It is a picturesque building, cruciform, with a
spire, and is rich in sepulchral remains, containing the ancestors of the Duke of Rutland--who
owns the town--in the tombs of a long line of Vernons and Manners. In the churchyard are several
curious epitaphs, among them that of John Dale and his two wives, the inscription concluding,

  "A period's come to all their toylsome lives;
  The good man's quiet--still are both his wives."

In this churchyard is also the well-known epitaph often quoted:

  "Beneath a sleeping infant lies, to earth whose body lent,
  More glorious shall hereafter rise, tho' not more innocent.
  When the archangels trump shall blow, and souls to bodies join,
  Millions will wish their lives below had been as short as thine."

HADDON HALL.

Three miles below Bakewell, near the Wye, is one of the most famous old mansions of England--Haddon
Hall. This ancient baronial home, with its series of houses, its courtyards, towers, embattled
walls, and gardens, stands on the side of a hill sloping down to the Wye, while the railway
has pierced a tunnel through the hill almost underneath the structure. The buildings surround
two courtyards paved with large stones, and cover a space of nearly three hundred feet square.
Outside the arched entrance-gate to the first courtyard is a low thatched cottage used as a
porter's lodge. Haddon is maintained, not as a residence, but to give as perfect an idea as
possible of a baronial hall of the Middle Ages. To get to the entrance the visitor toils up
a rather steep hill, and on the way passes two remarkable yew trees, cut to represent the crests
of the two families whose union by a romantic marriage is one of the traditions of this famous
place. One yew represents the peacock of Manners, the present ducal house of Rutland, and the
other the boar's head of Vernon. Parts of this house, like so many structures in the neighborhood,
were built in the time of "Peveril of the Peak," and its great hall was the "Martindale Hall"
of Scott's novel, thus coming down to us through eight centuries, and nearly all the buildings
are at least four hundred years old.

Entering the gateway, the porter's guard-room is seen on the right hand, with the ancient "peephole"
through which he scanned visitors before admitting them. Mounting the steps to the first courtyard,
which is on a lower level than the other, the chapel and the hall are seen on either hand,
while in front are the steps leading to the state-apartments. The buildings are not lofty,
but there are second-floor rooms in almost all parts, which were occupied by the household.
There is an extensive ball-room, while the Eagle Tower rises at one corner of the court. Many
relics of the olden time are preserved in these apartments. The ancient chapel is entered by
an arched doorway from the court, and consists of a nave, chancel, and side aisle, with an
antique Norman font and a large high-back pew used by the family. After passing the court,
the banquet-hall is entered, thirty-five by twenty-five feet, and rising to the full height
of the building. In one of the doorways is a bracket to which an iron ring is attached, which
was used, as we are told, "to enforce the laws of conviviality." When a guest failed to drink
his allowance of wine he was suspended by the wrist to this ring, and the liquor he failed
to pour down his throat was poured into his sleeve. A tall screen at the end of the room formed
the front of a gallery, where on great occasions minstrels discoursed sweet music, while at
the opposite end the lord and his honored guests sat on a raised dais. Here still stands the
old table, while behind the dais a flight of stairs leads up to the state-apartments. Stags'
heads and antlers of great age are on the walls. Another door opens out of the banquet-hall
into the dining-room, the end of which is entirely taken up with a fine Gothic window displaying
the Vernon arms and quarterings. This room is elaborately wainscoted. The royal arms are inscribed
over the fireplace, and below them is the Vernon motto carved in Gothic letters:

  "Drede God and Honour the Kyng."

An exquisite oriel window looks out from this room over the woods and grounds of Haddon, the
recess bearing on one of its panels the head of Will Somers, who was Henry VIII.'s jester.
The drawing-room, which is over the dining-room, is hung with old tapestry, above which is
a frieze of ornamental mouldings. A pretty recessed window also gives from this room a delightful
view over the grounds.

The gem of Haddon is the long gallery or ball-room, which extends over one hundred feet along
one side of the inner court: the semicircular wooden steps leading to this apartment are said
to have been cut from a single tree that grew in the park. The gallery is wainscoted in oak
in semicircular arched panels, alternately large and small, surmounted by a frieze and a turreted
and battlemented cornice. The ceiling is elaborately carved in geometric patterns, and the
tracery contains the alternating arms and crests of Vernon and Manners: the remains are still
visible of the rich gilding and painting of this ceiling. In the anteroom paintings are hung,
and from it a strongly-barred door opens upon a flight of stone steps leading down to the terrace
and garden: this is "Dorothy Vernon's Door;" and across the garden another flight of steps
leading to the terrace is known as "Dorothy Vernon's Steps." It was the gentle maiden's flight
through this door and up these steps to elope with John Manners that carried the old house
and all its broad lands into the possession of the family now owning it. The state bedroom
is hung with Gobelin tapestry, illustrating Æsop's fables: the state bed is fourteen feet high,
and furnished in green silk velvet and white satin, embroidered by needlework, and its last
occupant was George IV. The kitchen and range of domestic offices are extensive, and show the
marvellous amount of cooking that was carried on in the hospitable days of Haddon; the kitchen
has a ceiling supported by massive beams and a solid oak column in the centre; there are two
huge fireplaces, scores of stoves, spits, pothooks, and hangers, large chopping-blocks, dressers,
and tables, with attendant bakehouses, ovens, pantries, and larders; among the relics is an
enormous salting-trough hollowed out of one immense block of wood. Beyond the garden or lawn,
one hundred and twenty feet square, extends the terrace, planted with ancient yews, whose gnarled
roots intertwine with and displace the stones. This terrace extends the full width of the outer
or upper garden, and gives a charming view of the southern front of the hall.

More romance hangs about Haddon than probably any other old baronial hall in England, and it
has therefore been for years an endless source of inspiration for poets, artists, and novelists.
Mrs. Radcliffe here laid some of the scenes of the Mysteries of Udolpho. Bennett's "King of
the Peak" was Sir George Vernon, the hospitable owner of Haddon. Scott has written of it, a
host of artists have painted its most attractive features, and many a poet has sung of the

  "Hall of wassail which has rung
    To the unquestioned baron's jest:
  Dim old chapel, where were hung
    Offerings of the o'erfraught breast;
  Moss-clad terrace, strangely still,
    Broken shaft and crumbling frieze----
  Still as lips that used to fill
    With bugle-blasts the morning breeze."

But, unlike most baronial strongholds, the history of Haddon tells only the romance of peace,
love, and hospitality. It came by marriage into the possession of the Vernons soon after the
Conquest; one of them, Sir Henry Vernon of Haddon, was appointed governor of Prince Arthur
by Henry VII. His grandson, Sir George Vernon, lived in such princely magnificence at Haddon
that he was known as the "King of the Peak;" his initials, "G. V.," are carved in the banquet-hall.
Around his youngest daughter, Dorothy, gathers the chief halo of romance. The story in brief
is, that her elder sister, being the affianced bride of the son of the Earl of Derby, was petted
and made much of, while Dorothy, at sweet sixteen, was kept in the background. She formed an
attachment for John Manners, son of the Earl of Rutland, but this her family violently opposed,
keeping her almost a prisoner: her lover, disguised as a forester, lurked for weeks in the
woods around Haddon, obtaining occasionally a stolen interview. At length on a festal night,
when the ball-room was filled with guests summoned to celebrate the approaching nuptials of
the elder sister, and every one was so wrapped up in enjoyment that there was no time to watch
Dorothy, the maiden, unobserved, stole out of the ball-room into the anteroom, and through
the door, across the garden, and up the steps to the terrace, where her lover had made a signal
that he was waiting. In a moment she was in his arms, and rode away with him in the moonlight
all night, across the hills of Derbyshire, and into Leicestershire, where they were married
next morning. It was the old story--an elopement, a grand row, and then all was forgiven. Sir
George Vernon had no sons, and his daughters divided his estate, Haddon going to Dorothy, who
thus by her elopement carried the famous hall over to the family of Manners. Dorothy died in
1584, leaving four children, the oldest, Sir George Manners, living at Haddon and maintaining
its hospitable reputation. Dying in 1679, his son John Manners, who was the ninth Earl of Rutland,
became the master of Haddon, and "kept up the good old mansion at a bountiful rate," as the
chronicler tells us. He kept one hundred and forty servants, and had so many retainers and
guests that every day the tables in the old banquet-hall were spread as at a Christmas feast.
The earl was raised to the rank of duke, and his son John, Duke of Rutland, known as the "Old
Man of the Hill," died in 1779, since which time the family have not used the hall as a place
of residence, having gone to Belvoir in Leicestershire. Its present owner is the sixth Duke
of Rutland, Charles Cecil Manners, and the descendant of the famous Dorothy. There are few
places, even in England, that have the fame of Haddon, and it is one of the chief spots sought
out by the tourist. The duke maintains it just as it existed centuries ago, with the old furniture
and utensils, so as to reproduce as faithfully as possible the English baronial hall of his
ancestors.

CHATSWORTH.

Below Haddon Hall the valley of the Wye broadens, with yet richer scenery, as it approaches
the confluence of the Wye and Derwent at Rowsley, where the quaint old Peacock Inn, which was
the manor-house of Haddon, bears over the door the date 1653, and the crest of the ducal House
of Rutland, a peacock with tail displayed. Ascending for a short distance the valley of the
Derwent, which washes the bases of the steep limestone hills, we come to Chatsworth. In sharp
contrast with the ancient glories of Haddon is this modern ducal palace, for whose magnificence
Bess of Hardwicke laid the foundation. This "Palace of the Peak" stands in a park covering
over two thousand acres; the Derwent flows in front, over which the road to the palace is carried
by a fine bridge. From the river a lawn gently slopes upward to the buildings, and the wooded
hill which rises sharply behind them is surmounted by a hunting-tower, embosomed in trees.
A herd of at least a thousand deer roam at will over the park, and have become very tame. Chatsworth
is a brownish-yellow building, square and flat-topped, with a modern and more ornamental wing.
Its front extends fully six hundred feet, and in parts it is of that depth. The estate was
bought in the sixteenth century by Sir William Cavendish, who built the original house, a quadrangular
building with turrets, which was greatly extended by his wife. It was used as a fortress in
the Civil Wars, and was considerably battered. The first Duke of Devonshire about the year
1700 rebuilt the mansion, employing the chief architects, artists, designers, and wood-carvers
of his time, among them Sir Christopher Wren. In the grounds, not far from the bridge over
the Derwent, is the "Bower of Mary Queen of Scots." There is a small, clear lake almost concealed
by foliage, in the centre of which is a tower, and on the top a grass-grown garden, where are
also several fine trees. Here, under guard, the captive was permitted to take the air. In those
days she looked out upon a broad expanse of woods and moorland: now all around has been converted
into gardens and a park. Entering the house through a magnificent gateway, the visitor is taken
into the entrance-hall, where the frescoes represent the life and death of Julius Cæsar; then
up the grand staircase of amethyst and variegated alabaster guarded by richly-gilded balustrades.
The gorgeously-embellished chapel is wainscoted with cedar, and has a sculptured altar made
of Derbyshire marbles. The beautiful drawing-room opens into a series of state-apartments lined
with choice woods and hung with Gobelin tapestries representing the cartoons of Raphael. Magnificent
carvings and rare paintings adorn the walls, while the richest decorations are everywhere displayed.
Over the door of the antechamber is a quill pen so finely carved that it almost reproduces
the real feather. In the Scarlet Room are the bed on which George II. died and the chairs and
footstools used at the coronation of George III. On the north side of the house is another
stairway of oak, also richly gilded. In the apartments replacing those where Mary Queen of
Scots lived are her bed-hangings and tapestries. There is an extensive library with many rare
books and manuscripts, and a sculpture-gallery, lined with Devonshire marble, containing many
statues and busts, and also two recumbent lions, each nine feet long and four feet high and
weighing four tons, and carved out of a solid block of marble. The final enlargement of Chatsworth
was completed about forty years ago, when Queen Victoria made a state visit and was given a
magnificent reception by the Duke of Devonshire.

The gardens at Chatsworth are as noted as the house, and are to many minds the gem of the estate.
They cover about one hundred and twenty-two acres, and are so arranged as to make a beautiful
view out of every window of the palace. All things are provided that can add to rural beauty--fountains,
cascades, running streams, lakes, rockeries, orange-groves, hothouses, woods, sylvan dells--and
no labor or expense is spared to enhance the attractions of trees, flowers, and shrubbery.
From a stone temple, which it completely covers, the great cascade flows down among dolphins,
sea-lions, and nymphs, until it disappears among the rocks and seeks an underground outlet
into the Derwent. Enormous stones weighing several tons are nicely balanced, so as to rock
at the touch or swing open for gates. Others overhang the paths as if a gust of wind might
blow them down. In honor of the visit of the Czar Nicholas in 1844 the great "Emperor Fountain"
was constructed, which throws a column of water to an immense height. The grounds are filled
with trees planted by kings, queens, and great people on their visits to the palace. The finest
of all the trees is a noble Spanish chestnut of sixteen feet girth. Weeping willows do not
grow at Chatsworth, but they have provided one in the form of a metal tree, contrived so as
to discharge a deluge of raindrops from its metallic leaves and boughs when a secret spring
is touched. The glory of the Chatsworth gardens, however, is the conservatory, a beautiful
structure of glass and iron covering nearly an acre, the arched roof in the centre rising to
a height of sixty-seven feet. In this famous hot-house are the rarest palms and tropical plants.
It was designed by Joseph Paxton, the duke's head-gardener, and, enlarging the design, Paxton
constructed in the same way the London Crystal Palace for the Exhibition of 1851, for which
service he was knighted. Besides this rare collection of hot-house plants, the famous Victoria
Regia is in a special house at Chatsworth, growing in a tank thirty-four feet in diameter,
the water being maintained at the proper temperature and kept constantly in motion as a running
stream. The seed for this celebrated plant was brought from Guiana, and it first bloomed here
in 1849. Some fifty persons are employed in the gardens and grounds, besides the servants in
the buildings, showing the retinue necessary to maintain this great show-palace, for that is
its chief present use, the Duke of Devonshire seldom using it as a residence, as he prefers
the less pretentious but more comfortable seat he possesses at Bolton in Yorkshire. North of
Chatsworth Park, near Baslow, on top of a hill, is the strange mass of limestone which can
be seen from afar, and is known as the Eagle Rock.

MATLOCK AND DOVEDALE.

Retracing the Derwent to the Wye again, the valley of the latter is open below for several
miles, and then as Matlock is approached a mass of limestone stretching across the valley seems
to bar all egress, and the river plunges through a narrow glen. The bold gray crags of the
High Tor rise steeply on the left hand, and the gorge not being wide enough for both river
and railway, the latter pierces a tunnel through the High Tor. The river bends sharply to the
right, and the village makes a long street along the bank and rises in terraces up the steep
hill behind. These are the "Heights of Abraham," while the pretty slope below the High Tor
is the "Lovers' Walk." Matlock is beautifully situated, and its springs are in repute, while
the caves in the neighborhood give plenty of opportunity for that kind of exploration. The
Derbyshire marbles are quarried all about, and mosaic manufacture is carried on. It was near
Matlock that Arkwright first set up his cotton-spinning machine, and when fortune and fame
had made him Sir Richard Arkwright he built Willersley Castle for his home, on the banks of
the Derwent. The valley of the little river Dove also presents some fine scenery, especially
in the fantastic shapes of its rocks. The river runs between steep hills fringed with ash and
oak and hawthorn, and Dovedale can be pursued for miles with interest. One of its famous resorts
is the old and comfortable Izaak Walton Inn, sacred to anglers. In Dovedale are the rocks called
the Twelve Apostles, the Tissington Spires, the Pickering Tor, the caverns known as the Dove
Holes, and Reynard's Hall, while the entire stream is full of memories of those celebrated
fishermen of two centuries ago, Walton and his friend Cotton.

BEAUCHIEF ABBEY.

Before leaving Derbyshire the ruin of Beauchief Abbey, which gave the name of Abbey Dale to
one of the pleasant vales on the eastern border of the county, must not be forgotten. It was
built seven hundred years ago, and there remains but a single fragment of this famous religious
house, the arch of the great east window. Singularly enough, under the same roof with the abbey
was built an inn, and at a short distance there is a hermitage: the hermit's cave is scooped
out of a rock elevated above the valley and overhung with foliage. We are told that a pious
baker lived in the town of Derby who was noted for his exemplary life: the Virgin Mary, as
a proof of his faith, required him to relinquish all his worldly goods and go to Deepdale and
lead a solitary life in Christ's service. He did as he was told, departed from Derby, but had
no idea where he was to go; directing his footsteps towards the east, he passed through a village,
and heard a woman instruct a girl to drive some calves to Deepdale. Regarding this as an interposition
of Providence, the baker, encouraged, asked where was Deepdale; the woman told the girl to
show him. Arrived there, he found it marshy land, distant from any human habitation; but, seeking
a rising ground, he cut a small dwelling in a rock under the side of a hill, built an altar,
and there spent day and night in the Divine service, with hunger and cold, thirst and want.
Now, it happened that a person of great consequence owned this land--Ralph, the son of Geremund--and
coming to the woods to hunt, he saw smoke rising from the hermit's cave, and was filled with
astonishment that any one should have dared to establish a dwelling there without his permission.
Going to the place, he found the hermit clothed in old rags and skins, and, inquiring about
his case, Ralph's anger changed to pity. To show his compassion, he granted the hermit the
ground where the hermitage stood, and also for his support the tithe of a mill not far away.
The tradition further relates "that the old Enemy of the human race" then endeavored to make
the hermit dissatisfied with his condition, but "he resolutely endured all its calamities,"
and ultimately he built a cottage and oratory, and ended his days in the service of God. After
his death, Ralph's daughter prevailed upon her husband to dedicate Deepdale to religious uses,
and he inviting the canons, they built the abbey. We are told in Howitt's Forest Minstrel of
the wonder caused by the construction of the abbey, and also how in later years the monks became
corrupted by prosperity. A place is shown to visitors where the wall between the chapel and
the inn gave way to the thirsty zeal of the monks, and through an opening their favorite liquor
was handed. The Forest Minstrel tells us they

                "Forsook missal and mass
  To chant o'er a bottle or shrive a lass;
  No matin's bell called them up in the morn,
  But the yell of the hounds and sound of the horn;
  No penance the monk in his cell could stay
  But a broken leg or a rainy day:
  The pilgrim that came to the abbey-door,
  With the feet of the fallow-deer found it nailed o'er;
  The pilgrim that into the kitchen was led.
  On Sir Gilbert's venison there was fed.
  And saw skins and antlers hang o'er his head."

STAFFORD AND TRENTHAM.

The rivers which drain the limestone hills of Derbyshire unite to form the Trent, and this
stream, after a winding and picturesque course through Midland England towards the eastward,
flows into the Humber, and ultimately into the North Sea. Its first course after leaving Derby
is through Staffordshire, one of the great manufacturing counties of England, celebrated for
its potteries, whose product Josiah Wedgewood so greatly improved. The county-seat is Stafford,
on the Sow River, not far from the Trent Valley, and on a high hill south-west of the town
are the remains of the castle of the Barons, of Stafford, originally built a thousand years
ago by the Saxons to keep the Danes in check. This castle was destroyed and rebuilt by William
the Conqueror; again destroyed and again rebuilt by Ralph de Stafford in Edward III.'s reign.
In the Civil Wars this castle was one of the last strongholds of King Charles I., but it was
ultimately taken by Cromwell's troops and demolished, excepting the keep; a massive castellated
building of modern construction now occupies its place. The river Trent, in its winding course,
forms near Trentham a fine lake, and the beautiful neighborhood has been availed of for the
establishment of the splendid residence of the Duke of Sutherland, about a mile west of the
village, and known as Trentham Hall. The park is extensive, the gardens are laid out around
the lake, and the noble Italian building, which is of recent construction, has a fine campanile
tower one hundred feet high, and occupies a superb situation. The old church makes part of
Trentham Hall, and contains monuments of the duke's family and ancestors, the Leveson-Gowers,
whose extensive estates cover a wide domain in Staffordshire. Trentham, which is in the pottery
district and not far from Newcastle-under-Lyme, was originally a monastery, founded by St.
Werburgh, niece of Æthelred. She was one of the most famous of the Anglo-Saxon saints, and
some venerable yews still mark the spot where her original house stood, it being known as Tricengham.
These yews, said to have been planted about that time, form three sides of a square. The religious
house, rebuilt in William Rufus's reign, was given, at the dissolution of the monasteries by
Henry VIII., to his brother-in-law, Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, and it afterwards came
into possession of the Levesons. From the marriage of a daughter of Sir John Leveson with Sir
Thomas Gower sprang the family of the present ducal house of Sutherland, the head of it being
created Marquis of Stafford in 1786 and Duke of Sutherland in 1833. The present duke is the
third who has held the title, his mother having been the daughter of the Earl of Carlisle--the
famous Harriet, Duchess of Sutherland. The old Trentham Hall was built in 1633, being rebuilt
and enlarged by Sir Charles Barry about fifty years ago.

TAMWORTH AND TUTBURY.

Staffordshire contains some famous places. In the eastern part of the county, bordering Warwick,
is the ancient town of Tamworth, standing upon the little river Tame; this was originally a
fortification built for defence against the Danes, and its castle was founded by Marmion, of
whom Scott writes,

  "They hailed Lord Marmion,
    They hailed him Lord of Fontenaye,
    Of Lutterward and Scrivelbaye,
  Of Tamworth tower and town."

Tamworth is also Shakespearian ground, for here Richmond halted on his march to Bosworth Field,
and made a stirring address to inspire his forces for the coming combat. In later years Tamworth
sent Sir Robert Peel to Parliament, and his bronze statue adorns the market-square; the ruins
of the ancient castle are almost obliterated, and the present castle is upon higher ground,
its architecture being of various periods. Tutbury Castle, of which little is left but a straggling
mass of ruins, stands on an eminence overlooking the Dove, and crowns a ridge of red sandstone
rock: it was a great stronghold, founded by John of Gaunt, covering several acres, and was
demolished after the Civil Wars. This castle, like so many other famous places, was also one
of the prison-palaces of Mary Queen of Scots; although the castle is destroyed, yet near by
is its parish church of St. Mary, founded by Henry de Ferrars in the reign of William Rufus,
and known then as Ferrars Abbey: its west end is one of the most perfect Norman fronts remaining
in England, and it has been carefully restored. Tutbury is known for some of its ancient customs,
among them the annual bull-running. A minstrel band, after devotions and a long sermon in the
abbey, had an excellent dinner in the castle, and then repairing to the abbey-gate demanded
the bull; the prior let the bull out, with his horns and tail cut off, his ears cropped, his
body greased, and his nostrils filled with pepper to make him furious. The bull being let loose,
the steward proclaimed that none were to come nearer than forty feet, nor to hinder the minstrels,
but all were to attend to their own safety. The minstrels were to capture the bull before sunset,
and on that side of the river, but if they failed or he escaped across the stream, he remained
the lord's property. It was seldom possible to take him fairly, but if he was held long enough
to cut off some of his hair it was considered a capture, and after a bull-baiting he was given
to the minstrels. Thus originated the Tutbury bull-running, which ultimately degenerated into
a scene of wild debauchery, often resulting in a terrible riot. The Duke of Devonshire, when
he came into possession of Tutbury, was compelled to abolish the custom. About six miles from
Stafford is Chartley Castle, dating from the Conquest, and belonging to the Earls of Chester
and Derby, and subsequently to the famous Earl of Essex, who here entertained Queen Elizabeth,
and afterwards planned the plot for which she signed his death-warrant. This castle has been
many years in ruins: it had a circular keep about fifty feet in diameter, and the present remains
are chiefly the fragments of two round towers and part of a wall twelve feet thick, with loopholes
constructed for shooting arrows at an attacking force. Queen Mary was also imprisoned here,
and a bed said to have been wrought by her is shown in the village. This unfortunate queen
seems to have had more prisons and wrought more needlework than any other woman in Britain.

ALTON TOWERS.

Alton Towers, the superb home of the Earl of Shrewsbury, is also in Staffordshire, and is one
of the famous seats of England. The estate stands on the Churnet, and the house and grounds
are on one side of its deep valley. The present mansion, a modern Gothic structure, was built
about fifty years ago on a rocky plateau overlooking the valley. An extensive park surrounds
the mansion, and there are several entrances. Of these Quicksall Lodge ushers the visitor to
a magnificent approach known as the "Earl's Drive," extending three miles along the valley
of the Churnet, and having its natural advantages increased by the profuse distribution along
the route of statues, busts, and ornamental vases. Another entrance is from the railway-station,
where is a lodge of great beauty, from which the road, about a mile in length, gradually ascends
to the eminence where the mansion stands. The approach by both roads is fine, and through the
intervening foliage the Towers open upon the view--rich in spire, dome, and gable, and with
their fair proportions enhanced by the arcades that adorn the house and the antique stone setting
that brings out the majesty of the Gothic architecture. The gardens of this fine place are
beautiful, their extent being made apparently greater than in reality by the artificially-formed
terraces and other resources of the landscape artist. The grounds are most lavishly ornamented
with statuary, vases, temples, and fountains, while gardening is carried to perfection. There
is a grand conservatory, containing a palm-house and orangery. From the top of an elaborate
Gothic temple four stories high there is a fine view, while the Flag Tower, a massive building
with four turrets, and six stories high, is used as an observatory. There is a delightful retreat
for the weary sightseer called the Refuge, a fine imitation of Stonehenge, and Ina's Rock,
where Ina, king of Wessex, held a parliament after his battle with the king of Mercia. The
picturesque ruins of Alton Castle and convent are in the grounds, also the ruins of Croxden
Abbey and the charming Alton Church, which was of Norman foundation. The castle existed at
the time of the Conquest, and the domain in 1408, through the marriage of Maude Neville to
John Talbot, was brought into the possession of the present family. Talbot having been afterwards
made the first Earl of Shrewsbury. This was the famous English warrior who was so feared in
France, where he conducted brilliant campaigns, that "with his name the mothers stilled their
babes." He was killed at the siege of Chatillon in his eightieth year. It was the sixth Earl
of Shrewsbury who married Bess of Hardwicke and made her fourth husband. It was the fifteenth
Earl of Shrewsbury who erected the present magnificent structure, with its varied turrets and
battlements, for his summer residence, where before stood a plain house known as Alton Lodge.
Upon his tomb, in memory of the wonderful change he wrought in the place, is the significant
motto: "He made the desert smile." The nineteenth earl is now in possession.

SHREWSBURY.

Westward of Stafford is the land of the "proud Salopians," Shropshire, through which flows
the Severn, on whose banks stands the ancient town from which the Earls of Shrewsbury take
their title. We are told that the Britons founded this town, and that in Edward the Confessor's
time it had five churches and two hundred and thirty houses, fifty-one of which were cleared
away to make room for the castle erected by Roger de Montgomery, a kinsman of William the Conqueror.
The Norman king created him Earl of Shrewsbury long before the present line of earls began
with John Talbot. Wars raged around the castle: it was besieged and battered, for it stood
an outpost in the borderland of Wales. It was here that Henry IV. assembled an army to march
against Glendower, and in the following year fought the battle of Shrewsbury against Hotspur,
then marching to join Glendower. Hotspur's death decided the battle. The Wars of the Roses
were fought around the town, and here Henry VII., then the Earl of Richmond, slept when going
to Bosworth Field; and in the Civil Wars King Charles had Shrewsbury's support, but Cromwell's
forces captured it. The town is on a fine peninsula almost encircled by the Severn, and the
castle stands at the entrance to the peninsula. Only the square keep and part of the inner
walls remain of the original castle, but a fine turret has been added by modern hands. In the
neighborhood of Shrewsbury are the remains of the Roman city of Uriconium, said to have been
destroyed by the Saxons in the sixth century. Shrewsbury has always been famous for pageants,
its annual show being a grand display by the trade societies. It is also famous for its cakes,
of which Shenstone says:

  "And here each season do those cakes abide,
  Whose honored names the inventive city own,
  Rendering through Britain's isle Salopia's praises known."

The great Shrewsbury cake is the "simnel," made like a pie, the crust colored with saffron
and very thick. It is a confection said to be unsafe when eaten to excess, for an old gentleman,
writing from melancholy experience in 1595, records that "sodden bread which bee called simnels
bee verie unwholesome." The Shropshire legend about its origin is that a happy couple got into
a dispute whether they should have for dinner a boiled pudding or a baked pie. While they disputed
they got hungry, and came to a compromise by first boiling and then baking the dish that was
prepared. To the grand result of the double process--his name being Simon and her's Nell--the
combined name of simnel was given. And thus from their happily-settled contention has come
Shrewsbury's great cake, of which all England acknowledges the merit.

BRIDGENORTH AND WENLOCK ABBEY.

Following down the Severn River from Shrewsbury, we come to Bridgenorth, an ancient town planted
on a steep hill, full of quaint houses, and having an old covered market where the country-people
gather on Saturdays. The lower part is of brick, and the upper part is black-and-white-timbered,
but the human love for what is old and familiar is shown by the way in which the people still
fill up the old market-house, though a fine new one has recently been built. The most prized
of the old houses of this venerable town is a foundry and blacksmith shop standing by the river;
it was in this house that Bishop Percy, author of the Reliques, was born. On the promontory
of sandstone, which steeply rises about one hundred and eighty feet above the river, the upper
part of the town is built, and here are the ruins of Bridgenorth Castle, which stood in an
exceptionally strong situation. The red sandstone predominates here, but not much of it remains
in the castle, there being little left excepting a huge fragment of the massive wall of the
keep, which now inclines so much on one side from the settlement of the foundation as to be
almost unsafe. This castle was built eight hundred years ago by the third and last of the Norman
Earls of Shrewsbury: it was held for King Charles in the Civil Wars, and underwent a month's
siege before it surrendered, when the conquerors destroyed it. Bridgenorth is the most picturesque
of all the towns on the Severn, owing to the steep promontory up which the houses extend from
the lower to the upper town and the magnificent views from the castle. The communication with
the hill is by a series of steeply-winding alleys, each being almost a continuous stairway:
they are known as the "Steps." A bridge with projecting bastions crosses the river and connects
the higher with the lower parts of the town, thus giving the place its name.

About twelve miles south-east of Shrewsbury is the village of Much Wenlock, where there are
remains of a magnificent abbey founded by the Black monks, and exhibiting several of the Early
English and Gothic styles of architecture, but, like most else in these parts, it has fallen
in ruin, and many of the materials have been carried off to build other houses. Portions of
the nave, transepts, chapter-house, and abbot's house remain, the latter being restored and
making a fine specimen of ecclesiastical domestic architecture built around a court. An open
cloister extends the entire length of the house. There are beautiful intersecting Norman arches
in the chapter-house. There are some quaint old houses in the town--timbered structures with
bold bow-windows--and not a few of them of great age. Roger de Montgomery is credited with
founding Wenlock Abbey at the time of the Norman Conquest. The site was previously occupied
by a nunnery, said to have been the burial-place of St. Milburgh, who was the granddaughter
of King Penda of Mercia. This was a famous religious house in its day, and it makes a picturesque
ruin, while the beauty of the neighboring scenery shows how careful the recluses and religious
men of old were to cast their lots and build their abbeys in pleasant places.

LUDLOW CASTLE.

The most important of all the castles in the middle marches of Wales was Ludlow, whose grand
ruins, mouldered into beauty, stand upon the river Tame, near the western border of Shropshire.
It was here that the lord president of the Council of Wales held his court. Its ruins, though
abandoned, have not fallen into complete decay, so that it gives a fine representation of the
ancient feudal border stronghold: it is of great size, with long stretches of walls and towers,
interspersed with thick masses of foliage and stately trees, while beneath is the dark rock
on which it is founded. It was built shortly after the Conquest by Roger de Montgomery, and
after being held by the Norman Earls of Shrewsbury it was fortified by Henry I.: then Joyce
de Dinan held it, and confined Hugh de Mortimer as prisoner in one of the towers, still known
as Mortimer's Tower. Edward IV. established it as the place of residence for the lord president
of the Council that governed Wales: here the youthful King Edward V. was proclaimed, soon to
mysteriously disappear. From Ludlow Castle, Wales was governed for more than three centuries,
and in Queen Elizabeth's time many important additions were made to it. The young Philip Sidney
lived here, his father being the lord president; the stone bridge, replacing the drawbridge,
and the great portal were built at that time. In 1634, Milton's "Masque of Comus" was represented
here while Earl Bridgewater was lord president, one of the scenes being the castle and town
of Ludlow: this representation was part of the festivities attending the earl's installation
on Michaelmas Night. It was in Ludlow Castle that Butler wrote part of Hudibras. The castle
was held for King Charles, but was delivered up to the Parliamentary forces in 1646. The present
exterior of the castle denotes its former magnificence. The foundations are built into a dark
gray rock, and the castle rises from the point of a headland, the northern front consisting
of square towers with high, connecting embattled walls. In the last century trees were planted
on the rock and in the deep and wide ditch that guarded the castle. The chief entrance is by
a gateway under a low, pointed arch which bears the arms of Queen Elizabeth and of Earl Pembroke.
There are several acres enclosed, and the keep is an immense square tower of the Early Norman,
one hundred and ten feet high and ivy-mantled to the top. On its ground floor is the dungeon,
half underground, with square openings in the floor connecting with the apartment above. The
great hall is now without roof or floor, and a tower at the west end is called Prince Arthur's
Tower, while there are also remains of the old chapel. The ruins have an imposing aspect, the
towers being richly clustered around the keep. This famous castle is now the property of Earl
Powis.

The town of Ludlow adjoins the castle, and on approaching it the visitor is struck by the fine
appearance of the tower of the church of St. Lawrence. The church is said to be the finest
in Shropshire, and this tower was built in the time of Edward IV. Its chantry is six hundred
years old, and belonged to the Palmers' guild. Their ordinances are still preserved, one of
which is to the effect that "if any man wishes, as is the custom, to keep night-watches with
the dead, this may be allowed, provided that he does not call up ghosts." The town is filled
with timber-ribbed, pargetted houses, one of the most striking of these being the old Feathers
Inn. The exterior is rich in various devices, including the feathers of the Prince of Wales,
adopted as the sign perhaps in the days of Prince Arthur, when the inn was built. Many of the
rooms are panelled with carved oak and have quaintly moulded ceilings. It is not often that
the modern tourist has a chance to rest under such a venerable roof, for it is still a comfortable
hostelrie. The ancient priory of Austin Friars was at Ludlow, but is obliterated.

In the neighborhood of Ludlow are many attractive spots. From the summit of the Vignals, about
four miles away, there is a superb view over the hills of Wales to the south and west, and
the land of Shropshire to the northward. Looking towards Ludlow, immediately at the foot of
the hill is seen the wooded valley of Hay Park: it was here that the children of the Earl of
Bridgewater were lost, an event that gave Milton occasion to write the "Masque of Comus," and
locate its scenes at and in the neighborhood of Ludlow. Richard's Castle is at the southern
end of this wood, but there is not much of the old ruin left in the deep dingle. At Downton
Castle the romantic walks in the gardens abound in an almost endless variety of ferns. Staunton
Lacey Church, containing Romanesque work, and supposed to be older than the Conquest, is also
near Ludlow. But the grand old castle and its quaint and venerated Feathers Inn are the great
attractions before which all others pale. What an amazing tale of revelry, pageant, and intrigue
they could tell were only the old walls endowed with voice!

LICHFIELD CATHEDRAL.

We are told that in Central Staffordshire churches with spires are rare. The region of the
Trent abounds in low and simple rather than lofty church-towers, but to this rule the cathedral
city of Lichfield is an exception, having five steeples, of which three beautiful spires--often
called the "Ladies of the Vale"--adorn the cathedral itself. The town stands in a fertile and
gently undulating district without ambitious scenery, and the cathedral, which is three hundred
and seventy-five feet long and its spires two hundred and fifty-eight feet high, is its great
and almost only glory. It is an ancient place, dating from the days of the Romans and the Saxons,
when the former slaughtered without mercy a band of the early Christian martyrs near the present
site of the town, whence it derives its name, meaning the "Field of the Dead." This massacre
took place in the fourth century, and in memory of it the city bears as its arms "an escutcheon
of landscape, with many martyrs in it in several ways massacred." In the seventh century a
church was built there, and the hermit St. Chad became its bishop. His cell was near the present
site of Stowe, where there was a spring of clear water rising in the heart of a forest, and
out of the woods there daily came a snow-white doe to supply him with milk. The legend tells
that the nightingales singing in the trees distracted the hermit's prayers, so he besought
that he might be relieved from this trial; and since that time the nightingales in the woods
of Stowe have remained mute. After death the hermit-bishop was canonized and Lichfield flourished,
at least one of his successors being an archbishop. St. Chad's Well is still pointed out at
Stowe, but his Lichfield church long ago disappeared. A Norman church succeeded it in the eleventh
century, and has also been removed, though some of its foundations remain under the present
cathedral choir. About the year 1200 the first parts of the present cathedral were built, and
it was over a hundred years in building. Its architecture is Early English and Decorated, the
distinguishing features being the three spires, the beautiful western front, and the Lady Chapel.
The latter terminates in a polygonal apse of unique arrangement, and the red sandstone of which
the cathedral is built gives a warm and effective coloring. Some of the ancient bishops of
Lichfield were fighting men, and at times their cathedral was made into a castle surrounded
by walls and a moat, and occasionally besieged. The Puritans grievously battered it, and knocked
down the central spire. The cathedral was afterwards rebuilt by Christopher Wren, and the work
of restoration is at present going on. As all the old stained glass was knocked out of the
windows during the Civil Wars, several of them have been refilled with fine glass from the
abbey at Liège. Most of the ancient monuments were also destroyed during the sieges, but many
fine tombs of more modern construction replace them, among them being the famous tomb by Chantrey
of the "Sleeping Children." The ancient chroniclers tell bad stories of the treatment this
famous church received during the Civil Wars. When the spire was knocked down, crushing the
roof, a marksman in the church shot Lord Brooke, the leader of the Parliamentary besiegers,
through his helmet, of which the visor was up, and he fell dead. The marksman was a deaf and
dumb man, and the event happened on St. Chad's Day, March 2d. The loss of their leader redoubled
the ardor of the besiegers; they set a battery at work and forced a surrender in three days.
Then we are told that they demolished monuments, pulled down carvings, smashed the windows,
destroyed the records, set up guard-houses in the cross-aisles, broke up the pavement, every
day hunted a cat through the church, so as to enjoy the echo from the vaulted roof, and baptized
a calf at the font. The Royalists, however, soon retook Lichfield, and gave King Charles a
reception after the battle of Naseby, but it finally surrendered to Cromwell in 1646. Until
the Restoration of Charles II. the cathedral lay in ruins, even the lead having been removed
from the roof. In 1661, Bishop Hacket was consecrated, and for eight years he steadily worked
at rebuilding, having so far advanced in 1669 that the cathedral was reconsecrated with great
ceremony. His last work was to order the bells, three of which were hung in time to toll at
his funeral; his tomb is in the south aisle of the choir.

Lichfield has five steeples grouped together in most views of the town from the Vale of Trent,
the other two steeples belonging to St. Mary's and St. Michael's churches; the churchyard of
the latter is probably the largest in England, covering seven acres, through which an avenue
of stately elms leads up to the church. The town has not much else in the way of buildings
that is remarkable. In a plain house at a corner of the market-place, where lived one Michael
Johnson, a bookseller, Dr. Samuel Johnson, his son, was born in 1709. and in the adjacent market-place
is Dr. Johnson's statue upon a pedestal adorned with bas-reliefs: one of these represents the
"infant Samuel" sitting on his father's shoulder to imbibe Tory principles from Dr. Sacheverel's
sermons: another, the boy carried by his schoolfellows: and a third displays him undergoing
a penance for youthful disobedience by standing up for an hour bareheaded in the rain. David
Garrick went to school to Dr. Johnson in the suburbs of Lichfield, at Edial; Addison lived
once at Lichfield; and Selwyn was its bishop a few years ago, and is buried in the Cathedral
close; but the chief memories of the ancient town cluster around St. Chad, Johnson, and Garrick.

LADY GODIVA OF COVENTRY.

The "three spires" which have so much to do with the fame of Lichfield are reproduced in the
less pretentious but equally famous town of Coventry, not far away in Warwickshire, but they
do not all belong to the same church. The Coventry Cathedral was long ago swept away, but the
town still has three churches of much interest, and is rich in the old brick-and-timbered architecture
of two and three centuries ago. But the boast of Coventry is Lady Godiva, wife of the Earl
of Mercia, who died in 1057. The townsfolk suffered under heavy taxes and services, and she
besought her lord to relieve them. After steady refusals he finally consented, but under a
condition which he was sure Lady Godiva would not accept, which was none other than that she
should ride naked from one end of the town to the other. To his astonishment she consented,
and, as Dugdale informs us, "The noble lady upon an appointed day got on horseback naked, with
her hair loose, so that it covered all her body but the legs, and then performing her journey,
she returned with joy to her husband, who thereupon granted the inhabitants a charter of freedom."
The inhabitants deserted the streets and barred all the windows, so that no one could see her,
but, as there are exceptions to all rules, Tennyson writes that

  "One low churl, composed of thankless earth,
  The fatal byword of all years to come,
  Boring a little auger-hole, in fear
  Peeped; but his eyes, before they had their will,
  Were shrivelled into darkness in his head,
  And drop: before him. So the Powers who wait
  On noble deeds cancelled a sense misused;
  And she, that knew not, passed."

Thus has "Peeping Tom of Coventry" passed into a byword, and his statue stands in a niche on
the front of a house on the High Street, as if leaning out of a window--an ancient and battered
effigy for all the world to see. Like all other things that come down to us by tradition, this
legend is doubted, but in Coventry there are sincere believers, and "Lady Godiva's Procession"
used to be an annual display, closing with a fair: this ceremony was opened by religious services,
after which the procession started, the troops and city authorities, with music and banners,
escorting Lady Godiva, a woman made up for the occasion in gauzy tights and riding a cream-colored
horse; representatives of the trades and civic societies followed her. This pageant has fallen
into disuse.

In this ancient city of Coventry there are some interesting memorials of the past--the venerable
gateway, the old St. Mary's Hall, with its protruding gable fronting on the street, coming
down to us from the fourteenth century, and many other quaint brick and half-timbered and strongly-constructed
houses that link the dim past with the active present. Its three spires surmount St. Michael's,
Trinity, and Christ churches, and while all are fine, the first is the best, being regarded
as one of the most beautiful spires in England. The ancient stone pulpit of Trinity Church,
constructed in the form of a balcony of open stone-work, is also much admired. St. Michael's
Church, which dates from the fourteenth century, is large enough to be a cathedral, and its
steeple is said to have been the first constructed. This beautiful and remarkably slender spire
rises three hundred and three feet, its lowest stage being an octagonal lantern supported by
flying buttresses. The supporting tower has been elaborately decorated, but much of the sculpture
has fallen into decay, being made of the rich but friable red sandstone of this part of the
country; the interior of the church has recently been restored. The Coventry workhouse is located
in an old monastery, where a part of the cloisters remain, with the dormitory above; in it
is an oriel window where Queen Elizabeth on visiting the town is reputed to have stood and
answered a reception address in rhyme from the "Men of Coventrie" with some doggerel of equal
merit, and concluding with the words, "Good Lord, what fools ye be!" The good Queen Bess, we
are told, liked to visit Coventry to see bull-baiting. As we have said, Coventry formerly had
a cathedral and a castle, but both have been swept away; it was an important stronghold after
the Norman Conquest, when the Earls of Chester were lords of the place. In the fourteenth century
it was fortified with walls of great height and thickness, three miles in circuit and strengthened
by thirty-two towers, each of the twelve gates being defended by a portcullis. A parliament
was held at Coventry by Henry VI., and Henry VII. was heartily welcomed there after Bosworth
Field; while the town was also a favorite residence of Edward the Black Prince. Among the many
places of captivity for Mary Queen of Scots Coventry also figures; the walls were mostly knocked
down during the Civil Wars, and now only some fragments, with one of the old gates, remain.
In later years it has been chiefly celebrated in the peaceful arts in the manufacture of silks
and ribbons and the dyeing of broad-cloth in "Coventry true blue;" at present it is the "Coventry
bicycle" that makes Lady Godiva's ancient city famous, and provides amusement for youth who
are able to balance their bodies possibly at the expense of their minds.

BELVOIR CASTLE.

In describing the ancient baronial mansion, Haddon Hall, it was mentioned that the Dukes of
Rutland had abandoned it as their residence about a hundred years ago and gone to Belvoir in
Leicestershire. Belvoir (pronounced Beever) Castle stands on the eastern border of Leicestershire,
in a magnificent situation on a high wooded hill, and gets its name from the beautiful view
its occupants enjoy over a wide expanse of country. In ancient times it was a priory, and it
has been a castle since the Norman Conquest. Many of the large estates attached to Belvoir
have come down by uninterrupted succession from that time to the present Duke of Rutland. The
castle itself, however, after the Conquest belonged to the Earl of Chester, and afterwards
to the family of Lord Ros. In the sixteenth century, by a fortunate marriage, the castle passed
into the Manners family. Thomas Manners was created by Henry VIII. the first Earl of Rutland,
and he restored the castle, which had for some time been in ruins. His son enlarged it, making
a noble residence. The sixth Earl of Rutland had two sons, we are told, who were murdered by
witchcraft at Belvoir through the sorcery of three female servants in revenge for their dismissal.
The three "witches" were tried and committed to Lincoln jail. They were a mother and two daughters,
and the mother before going to the jail wished the bread and butter she ate might choke her
if guilty. Sure enough, the chronicler tells us, she died on the way to jail, and the two daughters,
afterwards confessing their guilt, were executed March 11, 1618. The seventh Earl of Rutland
received Charles I. at Belvoir, and in the wars that followed the castle was besieged and ruined.
After the Restoration it was rebuilt, and in finer style. The Dukes of Rutland began to adapt
it more and more as a family residence, and, after abandoning Haddon Hall, Belvoir was greatly
altered and made a princely mansion. It consists of a quadrangular court, around which are
castellated buildings, with towers surmounting them, and occupying almost the entire summit
of the hill. Here the duke can look out over no less than twenty-two of his manors in the neighboring
valleys. The interior is sumptuously furnished, and has a collection of valuable paintings.
A large part of the ancient castle was burnt in 1816. The Staunton Tower, however, still exists.
It is the stronghold of the castle, and was successfully defended by Lord Staunton against
William of Normandy. Upon every royal visit the key of this tower is presented to the sovereign,
the last occasion being a visit of Queen Victoria. Belvoir, in the generous hands of the Dukes
of Rutland, still maintains the princely hospitality of the "King of the Peak." A record kept
of a recent period of thirteen weeks, from Christmas to Easter, shows that two thousand persons
dined at the duke's table, two thousand four hundred and twenty-one in the steward's room,
and eleven thousand three hundred and twelve in the servants' hall. They were blessed with
good appetites too, for they devoured about $7000 worth of provisions, including eight thousand
three hundred and thirty-three loaves of bread and twenty-two thousand nine hundred and sixty-three
pounds of meat, exclusive of game, besides drinking two thousand four hundred bottles of wine
and seventy hogsheads of ale. Thus does Belvoir maintain the inheritance of hospitable obligation
descended from Haddon Hall.

CHARNWOOD FOREST.

We have now come into Leicestershire, and in that county, north of Leicester City, is the outcropping
of the earth's rocky backbone, which has been thrust up into high wooded hills along the edge
of the valley of the Soar for several miles, and is known as Charnwood Forest. It hardly deserves
the name of a forest, however, for most of this strange rocky region is bare of trees, and
many of the patches of wood that are there are of recent growth. Yet in ancient years there
was plenty of wood, and a tradition comes down to us that in Charnwood once upon a time a squirrel
could travel six miles on the trees without touching the ground, and a traveller journey entirely
across the forest without seeing the sun. The district consists of two lines of irregular ridgy
hills, rising three hundred to four hundred feet above the neighboring country. These ridges
are separated by a sort of valley like a Norwegian fjord, tilled with red marl. The rocks are
generally volcanic products, with much slate, which is extensively quarried. Granite and sienite
are also quarried, and at the chief granite-quarry--Mount Sorrel, an eminence which projects
into the valley of the Soar--was in former times the castle of Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester.
In King John's reign the garrison of this castle so harassed the neighborhood that it was described
as the "nest of the devil and a den of thieves." In Henry III.'s reign it was captured and
demolished; the latter fate is gradually befalling the hill on which it stood, under the operations
of the quarrymen. Near these quarries is the ancient village of Groby, which was quite a flourishing
place eight hundred years ago, and has not grown much since. This village belonged to the Ferrars
family, and an heiress of that family was the unfortunate Queen Elizabeth Widvile. About two
miles away is Bradgate, a spot of rare beauty and interest, the history of which is closely
connected with Groby. On the end of one of the ridges of Charnwood, just where it is sinking
down to the level of the surrounding country, stands Bradgate House. The surrounding park is
quite wild and bare, but there are fine old oaks in the lower portions. From the ancient house
a beautiful dell, called the Happy Valley, leads to the neighboring village of Newtown Linford.
Bradgate House was destroyed in the early part of the last century by its mistress. The Earl
of Suffolk, who then owned it, brought his wife, who had no taste for a rural life, from the
metropolis to live there. Her sister in London wrote to inquire how she was getting on. She
answered, "The house is tolerable, the country a forest, and the inhabitants all brutes." In
reply the sister advised, "Set the house on fire, and run away by the light of it." The countess
took the advice, and Bradgate never was rebuilt.

ULVERSCROFT AND GRACE DIEU ABBEY.

Charnwood Forest, like almost every other place in England, contains the remains of religious
houses. There was a priory at Ulverscroft, not far from Bradgate, and some picturesque moss-grown
remains still exist, said to be the finest ruin in Leicestershire. Grace Dieu Abbey was also
in the forest, and on the dissolution of the monasteries was granted to the Beaumonts; the
ruins of this abbey were much frequented by Wordsworth, who dedicated his poems to their owner.
The Cistercians have in the present century established the monastery of Mont St. Bernard in
the forest, and brought large tracts under cultivation as garden-land. Bardon, the highest
hill of Charnwood, which is near by, rises nine hundred feet, an obtuse-angled triangular summit
that can be seen for miles away: not far from the forest are several famous places. The abandoned
castle of Ashby de la Zouche has been made the site of an interesting town, deriving much prosperity
from its neighboring coal-mines: this castle was built by Lord Hastings, and here dwelt Ivanhoe.
The ruins of the tower, chapel, and great hall are objects of much interest, and in the chapel
is the "finger pillory" for the punishment of those who were disorderly in church. Staunton
Harold, the seat of Earl Ferrars, is north of the town, while about nine miles to the north-east
of Ashby is Donington Hall, the palace of the Marquis of Hastings: this estate is connected
with Langley Priory, three miles southward; the latter domain belonged to the Cheslyns fifty
years ago, and had an income of $40,000 a year. Between lavish hospitality and ruinous lawsuits
the entire property was eaten up, and Richard Cheslyn became practically a pauper; but he bore
ill-fortune with good grace, and maintained his genial character to the last, being always
well received at all the noble houses where he formerly visited. Sir Bernard Burke writes that
Cheslyn "at dinner-parties, at which every portion of his dress was the cast-off clothes of
his grander friends, always looked and was the gentleman; he made no secret of his poverty
or of the generous hands that had 'rigged him out.' 'This coat,' he has been heard to say,
'was Radcliffe's; these pants, Granby's; this waistcoat, Scarborough's.' His cheerfulness never
forsook him; he was the victim of others' mismanagement and profusion, not of his own." John
Shakespear, the famous linguist, whose talents were discovered by Lord Moira, who had him educated,
was a cowherd on the Langley estate. The poor cowherd afterwards bought the estates for $700,000,
and they were his home through life.

ELIZABETH WIDVILE AND LADY JANE GREY.

Charnwood Forest is also associated in history with two unfortunate women. Elizabeth Widvile
was the wife of Sir John Grey of Groby, who lost his life and estate in serving the House of
Lancaster, leaving Elizabeth with two sons; for their sake she sought an interview with King
Edward IV. to ask him to show them favor. Smitten by her charms, Edward made her his queen,
but he was soon driven into exile in France, and afterwards died, while her father and brother
perished in a popular tumult. Her daughter married King Henry VII., a jealous son-in-law, who
confined Elizabeth in the monastery of Bermondsey, where she died. Bradgate passed into the
hands of her elder son by Sir John Grey of Groby, and his grandson was the father of the second
queen to which it gave birth, whose name is better known than that of Elizabeth Widvile--the
unfortunate "ten-days' queen," Lady Jane Grey. She lived the greater part of her short life
at Bradgate, in the house whose ruins still stand to preserve her memory. We are told by the
quaint historian Fuller that "she had the innocency of childhood, the beauty of youth, the
solidity of middle, the gravity of old age, and all at eighteen--the birth of a princess, the
learning of a clerk, the life of a saint, and the death of a malefactor for her parents' offences."
These parents worried her into accepting the crown--they played for high stakes and lost--and
her father and father-in-law, her husband and herself, all perished on the scaffold. We are
told that this unfortunate lady still haunts Bradgate House, and on the last night of the dying
year a phantom carriage, drawn by four gray horses, glides around the ruins with her headless
body. The old oaks have a gnarled and stunted appearance, tradition ascribing it to the woodsmen
having lopped off all the leading shoots when their mistress perished. The remains of the house
at present are principally the broken shells of two towers, with portions of the enclosing
walls, partly covered with ivy.

LEICESTER ABBEY AND CASTLE.

The city of Leicester, which is now chiefly noted for the manufacture of hosiery, was founded
by the Britons, and was subsequently the Roman city of Ratæ. Many Roman remains still exist
here, notably the ancient Jewry wall, which is seventy-five feet long and five feet high, and
which formed part of the town-wall. Many old houses are found in Leicester, and just north
of the city are the ruins of Leicester Abbey, This noted religious house was founded in the
twelfth century, and stood on a meadow watered by the river Soar. It was richly endowed, and
was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, but its chief fame comes from its being the last residence
of Cardinal Wolsey. This great man, once the primate of England, has had his downfall pathetically
described by Shakespeare. The king summoned him to London to stand trial for treason, and on
his way Wolsey became so ill that he was obliged to rest at Leicester, where he was met at
the abbey-gate by the abbot and entire convent. Aware of his approaching dissolution, the fallen
cardinal said, "Father abbot, I have come hither to lay my bones among you." The next day he
died, and to the surrounding monks, as the last sacrament was administered, he said, "If I
had served God as diligently as I have done the king, He would not have given me over in my
gray hairs." The remains were interred by torchlight before daybreak on St. Andrew's Day, 1530,
and to show the vanity of all things earthly tradition says that after the destruction of the
abbey the stone coffin in which they were buried was used as a horse-trough for a neighboring
inn. Nothing remains of the abbey as Wolsey saw it excepting the gate in the east wall through
which he entered. The present ruins are fragments of a house built afterwards. The foundations
that can still be traced show that it was a grand old building. The gardens and park now raise
vegetables for the Leicester market.

Leicester Castle still exists only in a portion of the great hall, but it has been enlarged
and modernized, and is now used for the county offices. The castle was built after the Norman
Conquest to keep the townspeople in check. It was afterwards a stronghold of Simon de Montfort,
Earl of Leicester, and it then became part of the Duchy of Lancaster. The Dukes of Lancaster
restored it, and lived there frequently in great pomp, and they also built the adjoining Hospital
of the Newarke and a singular earthwork alongside, called the Mount. Several parliaments were
held here, but after the time of Edward IV. the castle fell into decay. There are now few remains
of the original castle, excepting part of the great hall and the Mount or earthwork of the
keep, which is about thirty feet high and one hundred feet in diameter upon its flat, circular
top. Not far from Leicester was fought the last great battle of the "Wars of the Roses," Bosworth
Field, upon Redmoor Plain, about two miles from the village now known as Market Bosworth. It
was a moor at the time of the battle in 1485, overgrown with thistles and scutch-grass. Shakespeare
has been the most popular historian of this battle, and the well where Richard slaked his thirst
is still pointed out, with other localities of the scenes of the famous contest that decided
the kingship of England, Richard III. giving place to Richmond, who became Henry VII.

THE EDGEHILL BATTLEFIELD.

While we are considering this locality two other famous battlefields not far away, that together
were decisive of the fate of England, must not be overlooked. These were Edgehill and Naseby,
the opening and closing contests of the Civil War that overthrew Charles I., the scene of one
being visible from the other, though the intervening contest spread almost all over the island.
The high ground that borders Warwickshire and Northamptonshire has various roads crossing it,
and the opposing forces meeting on these highlands made them the scenes of the battles--practical
repetitions of many hot contests there in earlier years. The command of the Parliamentary army
had been given to the Earl of Essex, and he and all his officers were proclaimed traitors by
the king. Charles I. assembled an army at Nottingham in 1642 to chastise them, and it was considered
an evil omen that when the royal standard was set up on the evening of the day of assemblage,
a gale arose and it was blown down. Charles moved west from Nottingham to Shrewsbury to meet
reinforcements from Wales, and then his army numbered eighteen thousand men. Essex was at Northampton,
and moved southward to Worcester. Charles desired to march to London to break up the Parliament,
but to do this must either defeat or outflank Essex. He chose the latter plan, moved to Kenilworth,
but could not enter Coventry, because Lord Brooke, who was afterwards killed at Lichfield,
held it for the Parliament. Essex left Worcester, and pressed the king by forced marches, but
Charles turned his flank and started for London with Essex in pursuit. In October he reached
Edgecot, near the field at Edgehill, and there in the open country he was astonished to find
a gentleman amusing himself with a pack of hounds. He asked who it was who could hunt so merrily
while his sovereign was about to fight for his crown. Mr. Richard Shuckburgh was accordingly
introduced, and the king persuaded him to take home his hounds and raise his tenantry. The
next day he joined Charles with a troop of horse, and was knighted on the field of Edgehill.

Charles slept in the old house at Edgecot: the house has been superseded by a newer one, in
which is preserved the bed in which the king rested on the night of October 22, 1642. At three
o'clock next morning, Sunday, he was aroused by a messenger from Prince Rupert, whose cavalry
guarded the rear, saying that Essex was at hand, and the king could fight at once if he wished.
He immediately ordered the march to Edgehill, a magnificent situation for an army to occupy,
for here the broken country of the Border sinks suddenly down upon the level plain of Central
England. Essex's camp-fires on that plain the previous night had betrayed his army to Prince
Rupert, while Rupert's horsemen, appearing upon the brow of the hill, told Essex next morning
that the king was at hand. Edgehill is a long ridge extending almost north and south, with
another ridge jutting out at right angles into the plain in front: thus the Parliamentary troops
were on low ground, bounded in front and on their left by steep hills. On the southern side
of Edgehill there had been cut out of the red iron-stained rock of a projecting cliff a huge
red horse, as a memorial of the great Earl of Warwick, who before a previous battle had killed
his horse and vowed to share the perils of the meanest of his soldiers. Both sides determined
to give battle; the Puritan ministers passed along the ranks exhorting the men to do their
duty, and they afterwards referred to the figure as the "Red Horse of the wrath of the Lord
which did ride about furiously to the ruin of the enemy." Charles disposed his army along the
brow of the hill, and could overlook his foes, stretched out on the plain, as if on a map,
with the village of Kineton behind them. Essex had twelve thousand men on a little piece of
rising ground known afterwards as the "Two Battle Farms," Battledon and Thistledon. The king
rode along in front of his troops in the stately figure that is familiar in Vandyke's paintings--full
armor, with the ribbon of the Garter across his breastplate and its star on his black velvet
mantle--and made a brief speech of exhortation. The young princes Charles and James, his sons,
both of them afterwards kings of England, were present at Edgehill, while the philosopher Hervey,
who discovered the circulation of the blood, was also in attendance, and we are told was found
in the heat of the battle sitting snugly under a hedge reading a copy of Virgil.

The battle did not begin till afternoon, and the mistake the king made was in not waiting for
the attack in his strong position on the brow of the hill; but his men were impatient and in
high spirits, and he permitted them to push forward, meeting the attack halfway. Rupert's cavalry
upon encountering the Parliamentary left wing were aided by the desertion of part of the latter's
forces, which threw them into confusion; the wing broke and fled before the troopers, who drove
them with great slaughter into the village of Kineton, and then fell to plundering Essex's
baggage-train. This caused a delay which enabled the Parliamentary reserves to come up, and
they drove Rupert back in confusion; and when he reached the royal lines he found them in disorder,
with Sir Edmund Verney killed and the royal standard captured. Lord Lindsey wounded and captured,
and the king in personal danger: but darkness came, and enabled the king to hold his ground,
and each side claimed a victory. The royal standard was brought back by a courageous Cavalier,
who put on a Parliamentary orange-colored scarf, rode into the enemy's lines, and persuaded
the man who had it to let him carry it. For this bold act he was knighted by the king on the
spot and given a gold medal. There were about fourteen hundred killed in the battle, and buried
between the two farm-houses of Battledon and Thistledon, at a place now called the Graveyards.
Lord Lindsey died on his way to Warwick with his captors. Cromwell was not personally engaged
at Edgehill, although there as a captain of cavalry. Carlyle says that after watching the fight
he told Hampden they never would get on with a "set of poor tapsters and town-apprentice people
fighting against men of honor; to cope with men of honor they must have men of religion." Hampden
answered, "It was a good notion if it could be executed;" and Cromwell "set about executing
a bit of it, his share of it, by and by."

THE BATTLE OF NASEBY.

The last great contest of the Civil War, at which the fate of King Charles was really decided,
was fought nearly three years afterwards, June 14, 1645, and but a few miles north-east of
Edgehill, at Naseby, standing on a high plateau elevated nearly seven hundred feet. The Parliamentary
forces had during the interval become by far the stronger, and were engaged in besieging Chester.
The king and Prince Rupert in May left Oxford with their forces, and marched northward, hoping
to raise this siege. The king had gone as far north as Leicester, when, hearing that Lord Fairfax
had come from the borders of Wales and besieged Oxford, he turned about to relieve it. His
army was about ten thousand strong, and, having reached Daventry in June, halted, while Fairfax,
leaving Oxford, marched northward to meet the king, being five miles east of him on June 12.
Being weaker than Fairfax, the king determined on retreat, and the movement was started towards
Market Harborough, just north of Naseby. The king, a local tradition says, while sleeping at
Daventry was warned, by the apparition of Lord Strafford in a dream, not to measure his strength
with the Parliamentary army. A second night the apparition came, assuring him that "if he kept
his resolution of fighting he was undone;" and it is added that the king was often afterwards
heard to say he wished he had taken the warning and not fought at Naseby. Fairfax, however,
was resolved to force a battle, and pursued the king's retreating army. On June 13th he sent
Harrison and Ireton with cavalry to attack its rear. That night the king's van and main body
were at Market Harborough, and his rear-guard of horse at Naseby, three miles southward. Ireton
about midnight surprised and captured most of the rear-guard, but a few, escaping, reached
the king, and roused him at two in the morning. Fairfax was coming up, and reached Naseby at
five in the morning. The king held a council of war in the "King's Head Inn" at Market Harborough,
and determined to face about and give battle. The forces met on Broad Moor, just north of Naseby
village. Prince Rupert had command of the royal troops, and Sir Jacob Astley was in command
of the infantry. The king rode along the lines, inspiriting the men with a speech, to which
they gave a response of ringing cheers. Cromwell commanded the right wing of Fairfax's line,
while Ireton led the left, which was opposed by Rupert's cavalry. The advance was made by Fairfax,
and the sequel proved that the Parliamentary forces had improved their tactics. Rupert's troopers,
as usual, broke down the wing opposing them, and then went to plundering the baggage-wagons
in the rear. But fortune inclined the other way elsewhere. Cromwell on the right routed the
royal left wing, and after an hour's hot struggle the royal centre was completely broken up.
Fairfax captured the royal standard, and the king with his reserve of horse made a gallant
attempt to recover the day. But it was of no use. Fairfax formed a second line of battle, and
the king's wiser friends, seizing his horse's bridle, turned him about, telling him his charge
would lead to certain destruction. Then a panic came, and the whole body of Royalists fled,
with Fairfax's cavalry in pursuit. Cromwell and his "Ironsides" chased the fugitives almost
to Leicester, and many were slaughtered. The king never halted till he got to Ashby de la Zouche,
twenty-eight miles from the battlefield, and he then went on to Lichfield. There were one thousand
Royalists killed and four thousand five hundred captured, with almost all the baggage, among
it being the king's correspondence, which by disclosing his plans did almost equal harm with
the defeat. The prisoners were sent to London. A monument has since been erected on the battlefield,
with an inscription describing the contest as "a useful lesson to British kings never to exceed
the bounds of their just prerogative; and to British subjects, never to swerve from the allegiance
due to their legitimate monarch." This is certainly an oracular utterance, and of its injunctions
the reader can take his choice.

THE LAND OF SHAKESPEARE.

Close to the village of Naseby rises the Avon, some of its springs being actually within the
village, where their waters are caught in little ponds for watering cattle. The slender stream
of Shakespeare's river flows downward from the plateau through green meadows, and thence to
the classic ground of Stratford and of Warwick. It was at Stratford-on-Avon that Shakespeare
was born and died;

  "Here his first infant lays sweet Shakespeare sung,
  Here the last accents faltered on his tongue."

The old house where he was born is on the main street of the town, and has been taken possession
of by a Trust which has restored it to its original condition. Its walls are covered with the
initials of visitors; there is nothing to be seen in the house that has any proved connection
with Shakespeare excepting his portrait, painted when he was about forty-five years old. The
sign of the butcher who had the building before the Trust bought it is also exhibited, and
states that "The immortal Shakespeare was born in this house." His birth took place in this
ancient but carefully preserved building on April 23, 1564, and exactly fifty-two years later,
on April 23, 1616, he died in another house near by, known as the "New Place," on Chapel Street.
Excepting the garden and a portion of the ancient foundations nothing now remains of the house
where Shakespeare died; a green arbor in the yard, with the initials of his name set in the
front fence, being all that marks the spot. Adjoining the remnants of this "New Place" is the
"Nash House," where the curator representing the Shakespeare Trust has his home. This building
is also indirectly connected with Shakespeare, having belonged to and been occupied by Thomas
Nash, who married Elizabeth Hall, the poet's granddaughter, who subsequently became Lady Barnard.
The church of the Holy Trinity at Stratford contains Shakespeare's grave; five flat stones
lying in a row across the narrow chancel cover his family, the grave of Anne Hathaway, his
wife, being next to that of the poet; his monument is on the wall, and near it is the American
memorial window, representing the Seven Ages of Man. In the chancel upon the western side,
within a Grecian niche, is the well-known half-figure monument of Shakespeare that has been
so widely copied, representing him in the act of composition. The most imposing building in
Stratford is the "Shakespeare Memorial," a large and highly ornamental structure, thoroughly
emblematic, and containing a theatre. Stratford is full of relics of Shakespeare and statues
and portraits in his memory. There is a life-size statue of the poet outside the Town-Hall
which was presented to the city by Garrick in the last century, while within the building is
his full-length portrait, also a present from Garrick, together with Gainsborough's portrait
of Garrick himself. At the modest hamlet of Shottery, about a mile out of town, is the little
cottage where Anne Hathaway lived, and where the poet is said to have "won her to his love;"
a curious bedstead and other relics are shown at the cottage. Charlecote House, the scene of
Shakespeare's youthful deer-stealing adventure that compelled him to go to London, is about
four miles east of Stratford, near the Avon: it is an ancient mansion of the Elizabethan period.
In the neighborhood are also a mineral spring known as the Royal Victoria Spa and some ancient
British intrenchments called the Dingles.

WARWICK

The renowned castle of Warwick is upon the Avon, a short distance above Stratford. Warwick
was founded by the Britons at a very early period, and is believed to be as old in some parts
as the Christian era; it was afterwards held as a Christian stronghold against the Danes. Lady
Ethelfleda, daughter of King Alfred, built the donjon-keep upon an artificial mound of earth
that can still be traced in the castle grounds. The most ancient part of the present castle
was erected in the reign of Edward the Confessor, and in William the Conqueror's time it received
considerable additions, and he created the first Earl of Warwick. It was a great stronghold
in the subsequent wars, and an heiress brought the castle to Richard Neville, who assumed the
title in right of his wife, and was the famous Warwick, "the King-maker." After many changes
it came to the Grevilles, who are now the Earls of Warwick. This castle is one of the best
specimens of the feudal stronghold remaining in England, and occupies a lovely position on
the river-bank, being built on a rock about forty feet high; its modern apartments contain
a rich museum filled with almost priceless relics of the olden time. Here are also valuable
paintings and other works of art, among them Vandyck's portrait of Charles I. and many masterpieces
of Rembrandt, Paul Veronese, Leonardo da Vinci, Rubens, Holbein, and Salvator Rosa. In December,
1871, the great hall and suite of private apartments at Warwick were burnt, but the valuable
contents were almost all saved with little injury. The castle was restored by a public subscription.
It is built around a large oval-shaped court; the gatehouse tower is flanked by embattled walls
covered with ivy, and having at either extremity Cæsar's Tower and Guy's Tower; the inner court
is bounded by ramparts and turrets, and has on one side an artificial mound surmounted by an
ancient tower. From the modernized rooms of the castle, where the family live and the museum
is located, and which extend in a suite for three hundred and fifty feet, all the windows look
out upon beautiful views; many of these rooms are hung with tapestry. Cæsar's Tower, believed
to be the most ancient part of the castle and as old as the Norman Conquest, is one hundred
and seventy-four feet high; Guy's Tower, which was built in 1394, has solid walls ten feet
thick and is one hundred and twenty-eight feet high, disclosing fine views from the turrets.
The grounds are extensive, and the magnificent marble "Warwick Vase," brought from the Emperor
Adrian's villa at Tivoli in Italy, is kept in a special greenhouse, being one of the most completely
perfect and beautiful specimens of ancient sculpture known. St. Mary's Church at Warwick is
a fine building, which in the early part of the last century replaced the original collegiate
church of St. Mary, an edifice that had unfortunately been burnt. Thomas Beauchamp, one of
the earlier Earls of Warwick, was the founder of this church, and his monument with recumbent
effigy is in the middle of the choir. The Beauchamp Chapel, over four hundred years old, is
a beautiful relic of the original church still remaining, and stands on the southern side of
the new building. The whole of this portion of Warwickshire is underlaid by medicinal waters,
and the baths of Leamington are in the valley of the little river Leam, a short distance north-east
of the castle, its Jephson Gardens, a lovely park, commemorating one of the most benevolent
patrons.

Warwick Castle, like all the others, has its romance, and this centres in the famous giant,
Guy of Warwick, who lived nearly a thousand years ago, and was nine feet high. His staff and
club and sword and armor are exhibited in a room adjoining Cæsar's Tower; and here also is
Guy's famous porridge-pot, a huge bronze caldron holding over a hundred gallons, which is used
as a punch-bowl whenever there are rejoicings in the castle. There is nothing fabulous about
the arms or the porridge-pot, but there is a good deal that is doubtful about the giant Guy
himself and the huge dun cow that once upon a time he slew, one of whose ribs, measuring over
six feet long, is shown at Guy's Cliff. This cliff is where the redoubtable Guy retired as
a hermit after championing the cause of England in single combat against a giant champion of
the Danes, and is about a mile from Warwick. It is a picturesque spot, and a chantry has been
founded there, while for many years a rude statue of the giant Guy stood on the cliff, where
the chisel had cut it out of the solid rock. The town of Warwick is full of old gabled houses
and of curious relics of the time of the "King-maker" and of the famous Earl of Leicester,
who in Elizabeth's time founded there the Leicester Hospital, where especial preference is
given to pensioners who have been wounded in the wars. It is a fine old house, with its chapel,
which has been restored nearly in the old form, stretching over the pathway, and a flight of
steps leading up to the promenade around it. The hospital buildings are constructed around
an open quadrangle, and upon the quaint black and white building are some fine antique carvings.
The old "Malt-Shovel Inn" is a rather decayed structure in Warwick, with its ancient porch
protruding over the street, while some of the buildings, deranged in the lower stories by the
acute angles at which the streets cross, have oblique gables above stairs that enabled the
builders to construct the upper rooms square. This is a style of construction peculiar to Warwick,
and adds to the oddity of this somnolent old town, that seems to have been practically asleep
for centuries.

KENILWORTH.

About five miles from Warwick are the ruins of Kenilworth Castle, the magnificent home of the
Earl of Leicester, which Scott has immortalized. Geoffrey de Clinton in the reign of Henry
I. built a strong castle and founded a monastery here. It was afterwards the castle of Simon
de Montfort, and his son was besieged in it for several months, ultimately surrendering, when
the king bestowed it on his youngest son, Edward, Earl of Lancaster and Leicester. Edward II.,
when taken prisoner in Wales, was brought to Kenilworth, and signed his abdication in the castle,
being afterwards murdered in Berkeley Castle. Then it came to John of Gaunt, and in the Wars
of the Roses was alternately held by the partisans of each side. Finally, Queen Elizabeth bestowed
it upon her ambitious favorite, Dudley, Earl of Leicester, who made splendid additions to the
buildings. It was here that Leicester gave the magnificent entertainment to Queen Elizabeth
which was a series of pageants lasting seventeen days, and cost $5000 a day--a very large sum
for those times. The queen was attended by thirty-one barons and a host of retainers, and four
hundred servants, who were all lodged in the fortress. The attendants were clothed in velvet,
and the party drank sixteen hogsheads of wine and forty hogsheads of beer every day, while
to feed them ten oxen were killed every morning. There was a succession of plays and amusements
provided, including the Coventry play of "Hock Tuesday" and the "Country Bridal," with bull-and
bear-baiting, of which the queen was very fond. Scott has given a gorgeous description of these
fêtes and of the great castle, and upon these and the tragic fate of Amy Robsart has founded
his romance of Kenilworth. The display and hospitality of the Earl of Leicester were intended
to pave the way to marriage, but the wily queen was not to be thus entrapped. The castle is
now part of the Earl of Clarendon's estate, and he has taken great pains to preserve the famous
ruins. The great hall, ninety feet long, still retains several of its Gothic windows, and some
of the towers rise seventy feet high. These ivy-mantled ruins stand upon an elevated rocky
site commanding a fine prospect, and their chief present use is as a picnic-ground for tourists.
Not far away are the ruins of the priory, which was founded at the same time as the castle.
A dismantled gate-house with some rather extensive foundations are all that remain. In a little
church near by the matins and the curfew are still tolled, one of the bells used having belonged
to the priory. Few English ruins have more romance attached to them than those of Kenilworth,
for the graphic pen of the best story-teller of Britain has interwoven them into one of his
best romances, and has thus given an idea of the splendors as well as the dark deeds of the
Elizabethan era that will exist as long as the language endures.

BIRMINGHAM.

Thus far we have mainly written of the rural and historical attractions of Warwickshire, but
its great city must not be passed by without notice. The "Homestead of the Sons of Beorm" the
Saxon, while rising from small beginnings, has had a prodigiously rapid growth since the coal,
iron, and railways have so greatly swollen the wealth and population of manufacturing England.
It was at the time of the Conquest the manor of Bermingeham, or, as the Midland English prefer
to pronounce it, "Brummagem." It was held for many years by a family of the same name, and
had an uneventful history till the townsfolk ranged themselves on the side of Parliament in
the Civil War, in revenge for which Prince Rupert captured and pillaged Birmingham: it was
then a market-town, built mostly along one street, and noted for its smiths and cutlers, who
were kept busy in forging pikes and swords for the king's opponents. The great growth of the
city has been in the present century, when the population has trebled, and now approaches four
hundred thousand. The main features of its history relate to trade and manufactures, otherwise
its annals are comparatively commonplace. There is little remaining of the old town, almost
all the structures being modern. St. Martin's Church, replacing the original parish church,
or "Mother Church," as it is called, is a fine modern structure, and contains some interesting
monuments of the Bermingeham family. There are several other attractive churches, including
the Unitarian church of the Messiah, which is supported on massive arches, for it is built
over a canal on which are several locks: this has given cause for a favorite Birmingham witticism:

  "St. Peters world-wide diocese
  Rests on the power of the keys;
  Our church, a trifle heterodox,
  We'll rest on a 'power of locks.'"

Birmingham has many fine public and private buildings and some attractive streets, though much
of the town is made up of narrow lanes and dingy houses, with huge factories in every direction.
There are several small parks, the gifts of opulent residents, notably Aston Hall. This was
formerly the residence of the Holte family, and the fine old mansion which still stands in
the grounds was built by Sir Thomas Holte in the reign of James I. Charles I. is said to have
slept here for two nights before the battle of Edgehill, for which offence the house was cannonaded
by the Puritans and its owners fined. The grounds, covering about forty-two acres, are now
a park, and a picturesque little church has been built near the mansion. Some of the factories
of this metropolis of hardware are fine structures, but when their product is spoken of, "Brummagem"
is sometimes quoted as synonymous for showy sham. Here they are said to make gods for the heathen
and antiquities of the Pharaoh age for Egypt, with all sorts of relics for all kinds of battlefields.
But Birmingham nevertheless has a reputation for more solid wares. Its people are the true
descendants of Tubal Cain, for one of its historians attractively says that the Arab eats with
a Birmingham spoon; the Egyptian takes his bowl of sherbet from a Birmingham tray; the American
Indian shoots a Birmingham rifle; the Hindoo dines on Birmingham plate and sees by the light
of a Birmingham lamp; the South American horsemen wear Birmingham spurs and gaudily deck their
jackets with Birmingham buttons; the West Indian cuts down the sugar-cane with Birmingham hatchets
and presses the juice into Birmingham vats and coolers; the German lights his pipe on a Birmingham
tinder-box; the emigrant cooks his dinner in a Birmingham saucepan over a Birmingham stove;
and so on ad infinitum. A century ago this famous town was known as the "toy-shop of Europe."
Its glass-workers stand at the head of their profession, and here are made the great lighthouse
lenses and the finest stained glass to be found in English windows. The Messrs. Elkington,
whose reputation is worldwide, here invented the process of electro-plating. It is a great
place for jewelry and the champion emporium for buttons. It is also the great English workshop
for swords, guns, and other small-arms, and here are turned out by the million Gillott's steel
pens. Over all these industries presides the magnificent Town Hall, a Grecian temple standing
upon an arcade basement, and built of hard limestone brought from the island of Anglesea. The
interior is chiefly a vast assembly-room, where concerts are given and political meetings held,
the latter usually being the more exciting, for we are told that when party feeling runs high
some of the Birmingham folk "are a little too fond of preferring force to argument." But, although
famed for its Radical politics and the introduction of the "caucus" into England, Birmingham
will always be chiefly known by its manufactures, and these will recall its illustrious inventors,
Boulton and Watt. Their factory was at Soho, just north of the town. Here Watt brought the
steam-engine to perfection, here gas was first used, plating was perfected, and myriads of
inventions were developed. "The labors of Boulton and Watt at Soho," says the historian Langford,
"changed the commercial aspects of the world." Their history is, however, but an epitome of
the wonderful story of this great city of the glass and metal-workers, whose products supply
the entire globe.

FOTHERINGHAY.

In our journey through Midland England we have paused at many of the prison-houses of Mary
Queen of Scots. In Northamptonshire, near Elton, are the remains of the foundations of the
castle of Fotheringhay, out in a field, with the mound of the keep rising in front of them;
this was the unfortunate queen's last prison. It was a noted castle, dating from the twelfth
century, and had been a principal residence of the Plantagenets. Here Mary was tried and beheaded,
February 8, 1587. She is said to have borne up under her great afflictions with marvellous
courage. Conducted to the scaffold after taking leave of all, she made a short address, declaring
that she had never sought the life of her cousin Elizabeth--that she was queen-born, not subject
to the laws, and forgiving all. Her attendants in tears then assisted her to remove her clothing,
but she firmly said, "Instead of weeping, rejoice; I am very happy to leave this world and
in so good a cause." Then she knelt, and after praying stretched out her neck to the executioner,
imagining that he would strike off her head while in an upright posture and with the sword,
as in France; they told her of her mistake, and without ceasing to pray she laid her head on
the block. There was a universal feeling of compassion, even the headsman himself being so
moved that he did his work with unsteady hand, the axe falling on the back of her head and
wounding her; but she did not move nor utter a complaint, and, repeating the blow, he struck
off her head, which he held up, saying, "God save Queen Elizabeth!" Her lips moved for some
time after death, and few recognized her features, they were so much changed.

HOLMBY HOUSE.

Also in Northamptonshire is Holmby House, where King Charles I. was captured by the army previous
to his trial. It was built by Sir Christopher Hatton in Queen Elizabeth's time, but only the
gates and some outbuildings remain. After the battle of Naseby the king surrendered himself
to the Scots, and they, through an arrangement with the English Parliament, conducted him to
Holmby House, where he maintained something of sovereign state, though under the surveillance
of the Parliamentary commissioners. He devoted his time to receiving visitors, the bowling-green,
and the chess-table. This continued for some months, when a struggle began between the army
and the Parliament to decide whose captive he was. The army subsequently, by a plot, got possession
of Holmby, and, practically making prisoners of the garrison and the commissioners of Parliament,
they abducted the king and took him to a house near Huntingdon. Fairfax sent two regiments
of troops thither to escort him back to Holmby, but he had been treated with great courtesy
and declined to go back. Thus by his own practical consent the king was taken possession of
by Cromwell, Fairfax, and Ireton, who were in command, although they denied it, and put the
whole blame on one Cornet Joyce who was in command of the detachment of troops that took possession
of Holmby. The king was ultimately taken to London, tried, and executed in Whitehall. At Ashby
St. Leger, near Daventry, in Northamptonshire, is the gate-house of the ancient manor of the
Catesbys, of whom Robert Catesby was the contriver of the Gunpowder Plot. The thirteen conspirators
who framed the plot met in a room over the gateway which the villagers call the "Plot-room,"
and here Guy Fawkes was equipped for his task, which so alarmed the kingdom that to this day
the cellars of the Parliament Houses are searched before the session begins for fear a new
plot may have been hatched, while the anniversary is kept as a solemn holiday in London. The
lantern used by Guy Fawkes is still preserved in the Oxford Museum having been given to the
University in 1641.

BEDFORD CASTLE.

One of the most ancient of the strongholds of Midland England was the Bedicanford of the Saxons,
where contests took place between them and the Britons as early as the sixth century. It stood
in a fertile valley on the Ouse, and is also mentioned in the subsequent contests with the
Danes, having been destroyed by them in the eleventh century. Finally, William Rufus built
a castle there, and its name gradually changed to Bedford. It was for years subject to every
storm of civil war--was taken and retaken, the most famous siege lasting sixty days, when Henry
III. personally conducted the operations, being attended by the Archbishop of Canterbury and
the chief peers of the realm: this was in 1224, and the most ingenious engines of war were
used to batter down the castle-walls, which till then had been regarded as impregnable. The
stronghold was ultimately captured, chiefly through the agency of a lofty wooden castle higher
than the walls, which gave an opportunity of seeing all that passed within. The governor of
the castle, twenty-four knights, and eighty soldiers, making most of the garrison, were hanged.
King Henry then dismantled it and filled up the ditches, so as to "uproot this nursery of sedition."
The ruins lasted some time afterward, but now only the site is known, located alongside the
river Ouse, which runs through the city of Bedford. This town is of great interest, though,
as Camden wrote two centuries ago, it is more eminent for its "pleasant situation and antiquity
than for anything of beauty and stateliness." Its neighborhood has been a noted mine for antiquities,
disclosing remains of ancient races of men and of almost pre-historic animals of the Bronze
and Iron Ages. The town lies rather low on the river, with a handsome bridge connecting the
two parts, and pretty gardens fringing each shore. This bridge is a modern structure, having
succeeded the "old bridge," which stood there several centuries with a gate-house at either
end, in the larger of which was the old jail, that had for its most distinguished occupant
that sturdy townsman of Bedford, John Bunyan. The castle-mound, which is all that is left,
and on which once stood the keep, is on the river-shore just below the bridge, and is now used
for a bowling-green in the garden of the chief hotel. The memorials of the author of the Pilgrim's
Progress, first a prisoner and then a minister of the gospel in Bedford, are probably the most
prized remains of ancient days that Bedford has, though they are now becoming scarce.

JOHN BUNYAN.

Elstow, a village about one mile south of Bedford, was Bunyan's birthplace. The house is still
pointed out, though a new front has been put into it, and it is a very small building, suitable
to the tinker's humble estate. The village-green where he played is near by, alongside the
churchyard wall; the church, which has been little changed, stands on the farther side of the
yard, with a massive tower at the north-western angle, looking more like a fortress than a
religious edifice. The bells are still there which Bunyan used to ring, and they also point
out "Bunyan's Pew" inside, though the regularity of his attendance is not vouched for, as he
says "absenting himself from church" was one of his offences during the greater part of his
life. He married early and in poor circumstances, the young couple "not having so much household
stuff as a dish or spoon betwixt them both," though he considered it among his mercies that
he was led "to light upon a wife of godly parentage." He says that a marked change in his mental
condition suddenly began while playing a game of "tip-cat" on Sunday afternoon on the village-green,
having listened in the morning to a sermon upon Sabbath-breaking. His conscience smote him;
he abandoned the game, leaving his cat upon the ground, and then began his great spiritual
struggle. He joined the Baptists, and began preaching, for at length, after many tribulations,
he says, "the burden fell from off his back." He was persecuted, and committed to Bedford jail,
where he remained (with short intervals of parole) for about twelve years. Here he wrote what
Macaulay declares to be incomparably the finest allegory in the English language--the Pilgrim's
Progress. He was a voluminous author, having written some sixty tracts and books. Finally pardoned
in 1672, he became pastor of the Bedford meeting-house, and afterwards escaped molestation;
he preached in all parts of the kingdom, especially in London, where he died at the age of
sixty, having caught cold in a heavy storm while going upon an errand of mercy in 1688. His
great work will live as long as the Anglo-Saxon race endures.

WOBURN ABBEY.

The county of Bedford gives the title to the dukedom held by the head of the great family of
Russell, and Francis Charles Hastings Russell, the ninth Duke of Bedford, has his residence
at the magnificent estate of Woburn Abbey. It is about forty miles from London, and on the
Buckinghamshire border. Here the Cistercians founded an abbey in the twelfth century, which
continued until the dissolution of the religious houses by Henry VIII., and the last abbot,
Robert Hobs, was executed for denying the king's religious supremacy, the tree on which he
was hanged being still carefully preserved in Woburn Park. The abbey and its domain were granted
by the youthful king Edward VI. to John Russell, first Earl of Bedford, under circumstances
which show how fortune sometimes smiles upon mortals. Russell, who had been abroad and was
an accomplished linguist, had in 1506 returned, and was living with his father in Dorsetshire
at Berwick, near the sea-coast. Soon afterwards in a tempest three foreign vessels sought refuge
in the neighboring port of Weymouth. On one of them was the Austrian archduke Philip, son-in-law
of Ferdinand and Isabella, who was on his way to Spain. The governor took the archduke to his
castle, and invited young Mr. Russell to act as interpreter. The archduke was so delighted
with him that he subsequently invited Russell to accompany him on a visit to King Henry VII.
at Windsor. The king was also impressed with Russell, and appointed him to an office in the
court, and three years afterwards, Henry VIII. becoming king, Russell was entrusted with many
important duties, and was raised to the peerage as Baron Russell. He enjoyed the king's favor
throughout his long reign, and was made one of the councillors of his son, Edward VI., besides
holding other high offices, and when the youthful prince ascended the throne he made Russell
an earl and gave him the magnificent domain of Woburn Abbey. He also enjoyed the favor of Queen
Mary, and escorted her husband Philip from Spain, this being his last public act. Dying in
1555, he was buried in the little parish church of Chenies, near Woburn, where all the Russells
rest from his time until now. He thus founded one of the greatest houses of England, which
has furnished political leaders from that day to this, for the Dukes of Bedford and Devonshire
are the heads of the Whig party, and Lord John Russell (afterwards an earl) was the uncle of
the present duke.

Woburn Abbey remained until the last century much in its original condition, but in 1747 changes
began which have since been continued, and have resulted in the construction of the ducal palace
now adorning the spot. The mansion is a quadrangle enclosing a spacious court, the chief front
being towards the west and extending two hundred and thirty feet. It is an Ionic building with
a rustic basement, and within are spacious state-apartments and ample accommodations for the
family. The rooms are filled with the best collection of portraits of great historical characters
in the kingdom, and most of them are by famous artists. They include all the Earls and Dukes
of Bedford, with their wives and famous relatives, and also the Leicesters, Essexes, and Sydneys
of Queen Elizabeth's reign, with many others. The unfortunate Lord William Russell and his
wife Rachel are here, and over his portrait is the walking-stick which supported him to the
scaffold, while hanging on the wall is a copy of his last address, printed within an hour after
his execution. Of another of these old portraits Horace Walpole writes: "A pale Roman nose,
a head of hair loaded with crowns and powdered with diamonds, a vast ruff and still vaster
fardingale, and a bushel of pearls, are the features by which everybody knows at once the pictures
of Queen Elizabeth." There is a fine library, and passing out of it into the flower-garden
is seen on the lawn the stump of the yew tree which Mr. Gladstone felled in October, 1878,
as a memorial of his visit, he being as proud of his ability as a forester as he is of his
eminence as a statesman. From the house a covered way leads to the statue-gallery, which contains
an admirable collection, and the green-house, one hundred and fifty feet long, filled with
valuable foreign plants, the family being great horticulturists. Busts of the great Whig statesmen
are in the gallery, and it also contains the celebrated Lanti vase, brought from Rome. The
"Woburn Abbey Marbles" have long been a Mecca for sculpture-loving pilgrims from both sides
of the ocean. There are extensive stables, and to them are attached a fine tennis-court and
riding-house, both constantly used by the younger Russells. Beyond is a Chinese dairy kept
for show, and in a distant part of the grounds a curious puzzle-garden and rustic grotto. Woburn
Park is one of the largest private enclosures in England, covering thirty-five hundred acres,
and enclosed by a brick wall twelve miles long and eight feet high. It is undulating in surface,
containing several pretty lakes and a large herd of deer. Its "Evergreen Drive" is noted, for
in the spring-time it attracts visitors from all quarters to see the magnificence of the rhododendrons,
which cover two hundred acres. The state entrance to the park is through a large stone archway
with ornamental gates, called the "Golden Gates," on the road from London, and having two drives
of about a mile each leading up to the abbey. The dukes are liberal patrons of agriculture,
and their annual "sheep-shearing" used to be one of the great festivals of this part of England.
They have also aided in the work of draining the Fen country, which extends into Bedfordshire,
and which has reclaimed a vast domain of the best farm-land, stretching northward for fifty miles.

STOWE.

We are now approaching London, and, crossing over the border into Buckinghamshire, come to
another ducal palace. This is the fine estate, near the town of Buckingham, of Stowe, also
originally an abbey, which came into possession of the Temple family in the sixteenth century,
and in 1749 merged into the estate of the Grenvilles, the ancestors of the Duke of Buckingham,
its present owner. Stowe gets its chief fame from its pleasure-gardens, which Pope has commemorated.
They appear at a distance like a vast grove, from whose luxuriant foliage emerge obelisks,
columns, and towers. They are adorned with arches, pavilions, temples, a rotunda, hermitage,
grotto, lake, and bridge. The temples are filled with statuary. The mansion, which has been
greatly enlarged, has a frontage of nine hundred and sixteen feet, and its windows look out
over the richest possible landscape, profuse with every adornment. In the interior the rooms,
opening one into another, form a superb suite. There is a Rembrandt Room, hung with pictures
by that painter, and there were many curiosities from Italy: old tapestry and draperies; rich
Oriental stuffs, the spoils of Tippoo Saib; furniture from the Doge's Palace in Venice; marble
pavements from Rome; fine paintings and magnificent plate. Formerly, Stowe contained the grandest
collection in England, and in this superb palace, thus gorgeously furnished, Richard Grenville,
the first Duke of Buckingham, entertained Louis XVIII. and Charles X. of France and their suites
during their residence in England. His hospitality was too much for him, and, burdened with
debt, he was compelled to shut up Stowe and go abroad. In 1845 his successor received Queen
Victoria at Stowe at enormous cost, and in 1848 there was a financial crisis in the family.
The sumptuous contents of the palace were sold to pay the debts, and realized $375,000. A splendid
avenue of elms leads up from the town of Buckingham to Stowe, a distance of two miles.

Not far away from Buckingham is Whaddon Hall, formerly a seat of the Dukes of Buckingham, but
best known as the residence of Browne Willis, an eccentric antiquary, whose person and dress
were so singular that he was often mistaken for a beggar, and who is said "to have written
the very worst hand of any man in England." He wore one pair of boots for forty years, having
them patched when they were worn out, and keeping them till they had got all in wrinkles, so
that he was known as "Old Wrinkle-boots." He was great for building churches and quarrelling
with the clergy, and left behind him valuable collections of coins and manuscripts, which he
bequeathed to Oxford University. Great Hampden, the home of the patriot, John Hampden, is also
in Buckinghamshire. The original house remains, much disfigured by stucco and whitewash, and
standing in a secluded spot in the Chiltern Hills; it is still the property of his descendants
in the seventh generation.

CRESLOW HOUSE.

The manor of Creslow in Buckinghamshire, owned by Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, is a pasture-farm
of eight hundred and fifty acres, and is said to raise some of the finest cattle in England;
it was the home of the regicide Holland. The mansion is an ancient one, spacious and handsome,
much of it, including the crypt and tower, coming down from the time of Edward III., with enlargements
in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. It is a picturesque yet venerable building, with
many gables and curious chimneys, and surmounted by a square tower and loopholed turret. But
its chief interest attaches to the two ancient cellars known as the crypt and the dungeon:
the crypt is about twelve feet square, excavated in the limestone rock, and having a Gothic
vaulted ceiling, with a single small window; the dungeon is eighteen feet long, half as wide,
and six feet high, without any windows, and with a roof formed of massive stones. This is the
"haunted chamber of Creslow"--haunted by a lady, Rosamond Clifford, the "Fair Rosamond" of
Woodstock, often heard, but seldom seen, by those who stay at night in the room, which she
enters by a Gothic doorway leading from the crypt. Few have ever ventured to sleep there, but
not long ago a guest was prevailed upon to do it, and next morning at breakfast he told his
story: "Having entered the room, I locked and bolted both doors, carefully examined the whole
room, and satisfied myself that there was no living creature in it but myself, nor any entrances
but those I had secured. I got into bed, and, with the conviction that I should sleep as usual
till six in the morning, I was soon lost in a comfortable slumber. Suddenly I was aroused,
and on raising my head to listen I heard a sound certainly resembling the light, soft tread
of a lady's footstep, accompanied with the rustling as of a silk gown. I sprang out of bed
and lighted a candle; there was nothing to be seen and nothing now to be heard; I carefully
examined the whole room, looked under the bed, into the fireplace, up the chimney, and at both
the doors, which were fastened as I had left them; I looked at my watch, and it was a few minutes
past twelve. As all was now perfectly quiet, I extinguished the candle and soon fell asleep.
I was again aroused; the noise was now louder than before; it appeared like the violent rustling
of a stiff silk dress. I sprang out of bed, darted to the spot where the noise was, and tried
to grasp the intruder in my arms: my arms met together, but enclosed nothing. The noise passed
to another part of the room, and I followed it, groping near the floor to prevent anything
passing under my arms. It was in vain; I could feel nothing; the noise had passed away through
the Gothic door, and all was still as death. I lighted a candle and examined the Gothic door,
but it was shut and fastened just as I had left it; I again examined the whole room, but could
find nothing to account for the noise. I now left the candle burning, though I never sleep
comfortably with a light in my room; I got into bed, but felt, it must be acknowledged, not
a little perplexed at not being able to detect the cause of the noise, nor to account for its
cessation when the candle was lighted. While ruminating on these things I fell asleep, and
began to dream about murders and secret burials and all sorts of horrible things; and just
as I fancied myself knocked down by a knight templar, I awoke and found the sun shining brightly."

This ancient house was originally the home of a lodge of Knights Templar, and the dungeon,
which is now said to be appropriately decorated with skulls and other human bones, was formerly
their stronghold. At this weird mansion, within a few minutes' ride of the metropolis, we will
close our descriptive journey through Midland England, and its mystic tale will recall that
passage from the Book of Days which counsels--

  "Doubtless there are no ghosts;
  Yet somehow it is better not to move,
  Lest cold hands seize upon us from behind."

THE THAMES HEAD.

The river Thames is the largest and most important river in England, and carries the greatest
commerce in the world. From the Cotswold Hills in Gloucestershire it flows to the eastward
past London, and after a course of two hundred and twenty miles empties into the North Sea.
The confluence of many small streams draining the Cotswolds makes the Thames, but its traditional
source, or "The Thames Head," is in Trewsbury Mead, about three miles from Cirencester, and
at an elevation of three hundred and seventy-six feet above the sea-level. The waters of the
infant stream are at once pressed into service for pumping into the higher levels of a canal,
which pierces the Cotswolds by a long tunnel, and connects the Thames with the Severn River,
flowing along their western base. It receives many tiny rivulets that swell its current, until
at Cricklade the most ambitious of these affluents joins it, and even lays claim to be the
original stream. This is the Churn, rising at the "Seven Springs," about three miles from Cheltenham,
and also on the slope of the Cotswolds. The Churn claims the honor because it is twenty miles
long, while the Thames down to Cricklade measures only ten miles. But they come together affectionately,
and journey on through rich meadows much like other streams, until the clear waters have acquired
sufficient dignity to turn a mill. Cirencester (pronounced Cisseter), which thus has the honor
of being a near neighbor of the Thames Head, is an ancient town, occupying the site of the
Roman city of Corinium, and is known as the "metropolis of the Cotswolds." Here four great
Roman roads met, and among the many Roman remains it has is part of the ruins of an amphitheatre.
It was a famous stronghold before the Saxons came to England, and Polydorus tells how one Gormund,
an African prince, in the dim ages of the past, besieged it for seven long years. Then he bethought
him that if he could only set fire to the thatched roofs of the houses he could in the commotion
that would follow force an entrance. So he set his troops at work catching sparrows, and when
many were caught fastened combustibles under their tails and let them loose. The poor birds
flew straight to their nests under the thatches, set them in a blaze, and while the people
were busy putting out the fires Gormund got into the town. In memory of this it was afterwards
called the "City of Sparrows." The Normans built a strong castle here, and Stephen destroyed
it. The castle was rebuilt, and suffered the usual fate in the successive civil wars, and in
the Revolution of 1688 the first bloodshed was at Cirencester. It had a magnificent abbey,
built for the Black Canons in the twelfth century, and ruled by a mitred abbot who had a seat
in Parliament. A fine gateway of this abbey remains, and also the beautiful church with its
pretty tower. It is known now as the parish church of St. John, and has been thoroughly restored.
Within are the monuments of the Bathurst family, whose seat at Oakley Park, near the town,
has some charming scenery. Pope's Seat, a favorite resort of the poet, is also in the park.
Cheltenham, near which is the "Seven Springs," the source of the Churn, is a popular watering-place,
with the Earl of Eldon's seat at Stowell Park not far away. Here in 1864 a Roman villa was
discovered, which has been entirely excavated. It has twenty chambers communicating with a
long corridor, and there are several elegant tessellated pavements, while the walls are still
standing to a height of four feet. Two temples have also been found in the immediate neighborhood.
Substantial buildings have been erected to protect these precious remains from the weather.

SUDELEY CASTLE AND CHAVENAGE.

In the Cotswolds is the castle of Sudeley, its ruins being in rather good preservation. It
was an extensive work, built in the reign of Henry VI., and was destroyed in the Civil Wars;
it was a famous place in the olden time, and was regarded as one of the most magnificent castles
in England when Queen Elizabeth made her celebrated progress thither in 1592. After the death
of Henry VIII., his queen, Catharine Parr, married Lord Seymour of Sudeley, and she died and
was buried in this castle: it is related that her leaden coffin was exhumed in 1782, two hundred
and eighty years after her death, and the remains were found in excellent preservation. Among
the records of the castle is a manuscript stating that Catharine Parr was told by an astrologer
who calculated her nativity that she was born to sit in the "highest state of imperial majesty,"
and that she had all the eminent stars and planets in her house: this worked such lofty conceit
in the lady that "her mother could never make her sew or do any small work, saying her hands
were ordained to touch crowns and sceptres, not needles and thimbles." Near Tatbury, and also
in the Cotswolds, is the source of the classic river Avon, and north-west of the town is the
fine Elizabethan mansion of Chavenage, with its attractive hall and chapel. The original furniture,
armor, and weapons are still preserved. This was the old manor-house of the family of Stephens,
and Nathaniel represented Gloucestershire in Parliament at the time of the conviction of Charles
I.: it is related that he was only persuaded to agree to the condemnation by the impetuous
Ireton, who came there and sat up all night in urgent argument "to whet his almost blunted
purpose." Stephens died in May, 1649, expressing regret for having participated in the execution
of his sovereign. We are further told in the traditions of the house that when all the relatives
were assembled for the funeral, and the courtyard was crowded with equipages, another coach,
gorgeously ornamented and drawn by black horses, solemnly approached the porch: when it halted,
the door opened, and, clad in his shroud, the shade of Stephens glided into the carriage; the
door was closed by an unseen hand, and the coach moved off, the driver being a beheaded man,
arrayed in royal vestments and wearing the insignia of the Star and Garter. Passing the gateway
of the courtyard, the equipage vanished in flames. Tradition maintains also that every lord
of Chavenage dying in the manor-house since has departed in the same awful manner.

The Thames flows on after its junction with the Churn, and receives other pretty streams, all
coming out of the Cotswolds. The Coln and the Leche, coming in near Lechlade, swell its waters
sufficiently to make it navigable for barges, and the river sets up a towing-path, for here
the canal from the Severn joins it. The river passes in solitude out of Gloucestershire, and
then for miles becomes the boundary between Oxfordshire on the north and Berkshire on the south.
The canal has been almost superseded by the railway, so that passing barges are rare, but the
towing-path and the locks remain, with an occasional rustic dam thrown across the gradually
widening river. In this almost deserted region is the isolated hamlet of Shifford, where King
Alfred held a parliament a thousand years ago. Near it is the New Bridge, a solid structure,
but the oldest bridge that crosses the Thames, for it was "new" just six hundred years ago.
The Thames then receives the Windrush and the Evenlode, and it passes over frequent weirs that
have become miniature rapids, yet not too dangerous for an expert oarsman to guide his boat
through safely. Thus the famous river comes to Bablock Hythe Ferry, and at once enters an historic
region.

STANTON HARCOURT AND CUMNOR HALL.

A short distance from the ferry in Oxfordshire is Stanton Harcourt, with its three upright
sandstones, "the Devil's Coits," supposed to have been put there to commemorate a battle between
the Saxons and the Britons more than twelve centuries ago. The village gets its name from the
large and ancient mansion of the Harcourts, of which, however, but little remains. Pope passed
the greater part of two summers in the deserted house in a tower that bears his name, and where
he wrote the fifth volume of his translation of Homer in the topmost room: he recorded the
fact on a pane of glass in the window in 1718, and this pane has been carefully preserved.
The kitchen of the strange old house still remains, and is a remarkable one, being described
as "either a kitchen within a chimney or a kitchen without one." In the lower part this kitchen
is a large square room; above it is octangular and ascends like a tower, the fires being made
against the walls, and the smoke climbing up them until it reaches the conical apex, where
it goes out of loopholes on any side according to the wind. The distance from the floor to
the apex is about sixty feet, and the interior is thickly coated with soot. The fireplaces
are large enough to roast an ox whole.

Not far from the ferry, in Berkshire, is the ancient manor-house of Cumnor Hall, sacred to
the melancholy memory of poor Amy Robsart. She was the wife of Dudley, Earl of Leicester, and
when his ambition led him to seek Queen Elizabeth's hand it was necessary to get her out of
the way. So he sent Amy to Cumnor, where his servant Anthony Forster lived. At first poison
was tried, but she suspected it, and would not take the potion. Then, sending all the people
away, Sir Richard Varney and Forster, with another man, strangled her, and afterwards threw
her down stairs, breaking her neck. It was at first given out that poor Amy had fallen by accident
and killed herself, but people began to suspect differently, and the third party to the murder,
being arrested for a felony and threatening to tell, was privately made away with in prison
by Leicester's orders. Both Varney and Forster became melancholy before their deaths, and finally
a kinswoman of the earl, on her dying bed, told the whole story. Sir Walter Scott has woven
her sad yet romantic story into his tale of Kenilworth; and to prove how ambition overleaps
itself, we find Lord Burghley, among other reasons which he urged upon the queen why she should
not marry Leicester, saying that "he is infamed by the murder of his wife." The queen remained
a virgin sovereign, and Leicester's crime availed only to blacken his character.

FAIR ROSAMOND.

The Thames flows on past the wooded glades of Wytham Abbey, and then revives the memory of
Fair Rosamond as it skirts the scanty ruins of Godstow Nunnery. This religious house upon the
river-bank was founded in the reign of Henry I., and the ruins are some remains of the walls
and of a small chapter-house in which Rosamond's corpse was deposited. It was at Woodstock,
in Oxfordshire, then a royal palace, that in the twelfth century Henry II. built "Fair Rosamond's
Bower" for his charmer, who was the daughter of Lord Clifford. This bower was surrounded by
a labyrinth. Queen Eleanor, whom the king had married only from ambitious motives, was much
older than he, and he had two sons by Rosamond, whom he is said to have first met at Godstow
Nunnery. The bower consisted of arched vaults underground. There are various legends of the
discovery of Rosamond by Eleanor, the most popular being that the queen discovered the ball
of silk the king used to thread the maze of the labyrinth, and following it found the door
and entered the bower. She is said to have ill-treated and even poisoned Rosamond, but the
belief now is that Rosamond retired to the nunnery from sorrow at the ultimate defection of
her royal lover, and did not die for several years. The story has been the favorite theme of
the poets, and we are told that her body was buried in the nunnery, and wax lights placed around
the tomb and kept continually burning.

OXFORD.

As we float along the quiet Thames the stately towers and domes of the university city of Oxford
come in sight, and appear to suddenly rise from behind a green railway embankment. Here the
Cherwell flows along the Christ Church meadows to join the great river, and we pause at the
ancient Ousenford--or the ford over the Ouse or Water--a name which time has changed to Oxford.
The origin of the famous university is involved in obscurity. The city is mentioned as the
scene of important political and military events from the time of King Alfred, but the first
undisputed evidence that it was a seat of learning dates from the twelfth century. Religious
houses existed there in earlier years, and to these schools were attached for the education
of the clergy. From these schools sprang the secular institutions that finally developed into
colleges, and common interest led to the association from which ultimately came the university.
The first known application of the word to this association occurs in a statute of King John.
In the thirteenth century there were three thousand students at Oxford, and Henry III. granted
the university its first charter. In those early times the university grew in wealth and numbers,
and intense hostility was developed between the students and townspeople, leading to the quarrels
between "Town and Gown" that existed for centuries, and caused frequent riots and bloodshed.
A penance for one of these disturbances, which occurred in 1355 and sacrificed several lives,
continued to be kept until 1825. The religious troubles in Henry VIII.'s time reduced the students
to barely one thousand, but a small part of whom attended the colleges, so that in 1546 only
thirteen degrees were conferred. In 1603 the university was given representation in Parliament;
it was loyal to Charles I., and melted its plate to assist him, so that after his downfall
it was plundered, and almost ceased to have an existence as an institution of learning; it
has since had a quiet and generally prosperous history. The university comprises twenty-one
colleges, the oldest being University College, founded in 1249, and the youngest the Keble
Memorial College, founded in 1870. University College, according to tradition, represents a
school founded by King Alfred in 872, and it celebrated its millennial anniversary in 1872.
Balliol College, founded between 1263 and 1268, admits no one who claims any privilege on account
of rank or wealth, and is regarded as having perhaps the highest standard of scholarship at
Oxford. Christ Church College is the most extensive in buildings, numbers, and endowments,
and is a cathedral establishment as well as college. There are now about eighty-five hundred
members of the university and twenty-five hundred undergraduates. The wealth of some of the
colleges is enormous, and they are said to own altogether nearly two hundred thousand acres
of land in different parts of the kingdom, and to have about $2,100,000 annual revenues, of
which they expend not over $1,500,000, the remainder accumulating. They also have in their
gift four hundred and forty-four benefices, with an annual income of $950,000. It costs a student
about $1200 to $1500 a year to live at Oxford, and about $325 in university and college fees
from matriculation to graduation, when he gets his degree of B.A., or, if inattentive, fails
to pass the examination, and, in Oxford parlance, is said to be "plucked."

THE OXFORD COLLEGES.

The enumeration of the colleges which make up the university will naturally begin with the
greatest, Christ Church, founded by Cardinal Wolsey, of which the principal façade extends
four hundred feet along St. Aldate's Street, and has a noble gateway in the centre surmounted
by a six-sided tower with a dome-like roof. Here hangs the great bell of Oxford, "Old Tom,"
weighing seventeen thousand pounds, which every night, just after nine o'clock, strikes one
hundred and one strokes, said to be in remembrance of the number of members the college had
at its foundation. Wolsey's statue stands in the gateway which leads into the great quadrangle,
called by the students, for short, "Tom Quad." Here are the lodgings of the dean and canons,
and also the Great Hall, the finest in Oxford, and the room where the sovereign is received
whenever visiting the city. The ancient kitchen adjoins the hall, and near by is the entrance
to the cathedral, which has been restored, and the ancient cloisters. From the buildings a
meadow extends down to the rivers, the Cherwell on the left and the Thames (here called the
Isis) on the right, which join at the lower part of the meadow. Beautiful walks are laid out
upon it, including the famous Oxford promenade, the Broad Walk, a stately avenue of elms bordering
one side of the meadow. Here, on the afternoon of Show Sunday, which comes immediately before
Commemoration Day, nearly all the members of the university and the students, in academic costume,
make a promenade, presenting an animated scene.

Corpus Christi College was founded by Bishop Fox of Winchester in 1516, and its quadrangle,
which remains much as at the foundation, contains the founder's statue, and also a remarkable
dial, in the centre of which is a perpetual calendar. This college is not very marked in architecture.
It stands at the back of Christ Church, and adjoining it is Merton College, founded in 1264
by Walter de Merton. His idea was to forbid the students following in after life any other
pursuit than that of parish priest. The chapel of Merton is one of the finest in Oxford, and
its massive tower is a city landmark. The entrance-gateway, surmounted by a sculptured representation
of St. John the Baptist, is attractive, and the two college quadrangles are picturesque, the
"Mob Quad," or library quadrangle, being five hundred years old, with the Treasury and its
high-pitched ashlar roof and dormer windows above one of the entrance-passages. St. Alban Hall,
built about 1230, adjoins Merton, and is a Gothic structure with a curious old bell-tower.
Oriel College stands opposite Corpus Christi, but the ancient buildings of the foundation in
1324-26 have all been superseded by comparatively modern structures of the seventeenth century:
though without any striking architectural merits, the hall and chapel of this college are extremely
picturesque. Its fame is not so much from its buildings as from some of its fellows, Whately,
Keble, Wilberforce, Newman, Pusey, and Arnold having been among them. St. Mary's Hall, an offshoot
founded in the fourteenth century, stands near this college. All Souls College is on the High
Street, and was founded in 1437, its buildings being, however, modern, excepting one quadrangle.
In the chapel is a magnificent reredos, presented by Lord Bathurst, who was a fellow of All
Souls, and containing figures representing most of the fellows of his time: in the library
are Wren's original designs for building St. Paul's. This college was founded by Archbishop
Chichele for "the hele of his soul" and of the souls of all those who perished in the French
wars of King Henry V.; hence its name. We are told that the good archbishop was much troubled
where to locate his college, and there appeared to him in a dream a "right godly personage,"
who advised him to build it on the High Street, and at a certain spot where he would be sure
in digging to find a "mallard, imprisoned but well fattened, in the sewer." He hesitated, but
all whom he consulted advised him to make the trial, and accordingly, on a fixed day after
mass, with due solemnity the digging began. They had not dug long, the story relates, before
they heard "amid the earth horrid strugglings and flutterings and violent quackings of the
distressed mallard." When he was brought out he was as big as an ostrich, and "much wonder
was thereat, for the lycke had not been seen in this londe nor in onie odir." The Festival
of the Mallard was long held in commemoration of this event, at which was sung the "Merry Song
of the All Souls Mallard," beginning--

  "Griffin, bustard, turkey, capon,
  Let other hungry mortals gape on,
  And on the bones their stomach fill hard;
  But let All Souls men have their mallard.
    Oh, by the blood of King Edward,
    It was a wopping, wopping mallard!"

While the festival has passed away, the song is still sung at Oxford, and the tale has given
rise to much literature, there having been vigorous contests waged over the authenticity of
the mallard.

University College, also on the High Street, though the earliest founded, now has no building
older than the seventeenth century. It has an imposing Gothic front with two tower-gateways,
while the recently constructed New Building is an elegant structure erected in 1850. Queen's
College, founded in 1341 by Queen Philippa's confessor, and hence its name, is a modern building
by Wren and his pupils. St. Edmund Hall, opposite Queen's College, is a plain building, but
with magnificent ivy on its walls.

MAGDALEN AND BRASENOSE.

Bishop Patten of Winchester, who was surnamed Waynflete, founded Magdalen College in 1458.
It stands by the side of the Cherwell, and its graceful tower, nearly four hundred years old,
rises one hundred and forty-five feet--one of the most beautiful constructions in Oxford. Its
quadrangles are fine, especially the one known as the Cloisters, which remains much as it was
in the time of the founder, and is ornamented with rude sandstone statues erected in honor
of a visit from King James I. In accordance with ancient custom, on the morning of the first
of May, just as five o'clock strikes, a solemn Te Deum is sung on the top of Magdalen Tower,
where the choristers assemble in surplices and with uncovered heads. When it closes the crowd
on the ground below give out discordant blasts from myriads of tin horns, but the Magdalen
chime of bells, said to be "the most tunable and melodious ring of bells in all these parts
and beyond," soon drowns the discord, and gives a glad welcome to the opening of spring. This
custom survives from the time of Henry VII., and the produce of two acres of land given to
the college by that king is used to pay for a feast for the choristers, spread later in the
day in the college hall. The college has a meadow and small deer-park attached, known as the
Magdalen Walks, and encircled by the arms of the Cherwell, while avenues of trees along raised
dykes intersect it. The avenue on the north side of this meadow is known as "Addison's Walk,"
and was much frequented by him when at this college. The little deer-park, a secluded spot,
abounds with magnificent elms. It was at Magdalen that Wolsey was educated, being known as
the "Boy Bachelor," as he got his B.A. degree at the early age of fifteen. The Botanic Garden
is opposite Magdalen College, having a fine gateway with statues of Charles I. and II. Magdalen
College School, a modern building, but an organization coeval with the college, is a short
distance to the westward.

The King's Hall, commonly known as Brasenose College, and over the entrance of which is a prominent
brazen nose, still retains its chief buildings as originally founded by the Bishop of Lincoln
and Sir Richard Sutton in 1512. The entrance-tower was recently restored, and the rooms occupied
by Bishop Heber, who was a member of this college, are still pointed out, with their windows
looking upon a large horse-chestnut tree in the adjoining Exeter Gardens. This famous college
is said to occupy the spot where King Alfred's palace stood, and hence its name of the King's
Hall, which the king in his laws styled his palace. The part of the palace which was used for
the brew-house, or the brasinium, afterwards became the college, and as early as Edward I.
this found ocular demonstration by the fixing of a brazen nose upon the gate. This is also
a relic of Friar Bacon's brazen head. We are told that this famous friar, who lived at Oxford
in the thirteenth century, became convinced, "after great study," that if he should succeed
in making a head of brass which could speak, "he might be able to surround all England with
a wall of brass." So, with the assistance of another friar and the devil, he went to work and
accomplished it, but with the drawback that the brazen head when finished was "warranted to
speak in the course of one month," but it was uncertain just when it would speak, and "if they
heard it not before it had done speaking, all their labor would be lost." They watched it three
weeks, but fatigue overmastered them, and Bacon set his servant on watch, with orders to awaken
them if the head should speak. At the end of one half hour the fellow heard the head say, "Time
is;" at the end of another, "Time was;" and at the end of a third half hour, "Time's past,"
when down fell the head with a tremendous crash. The blockhead thought his master would be
angry if disturbed by such trifles, and this ended the experiment with the brazen head. Yet
Friar Bacon was a much wiser man than would be supposed by those who only know him from this
tale. He was esteemed the most learned man ever at the great university, and it is considered
doubtful if any there in later years surpassed him.

NEW COLLEGE AND RADCLIFFE LIBRARY.

William of Wykeham founded the New College, or the College of St. Mary Winton, in 1380. It
has a noble entrance, and in a niche above the gateway is the Virgin, to whom an angel and
the founder are addressing themselves in prayer. The chapel has a massive detached bell-tower,
and in its windows are some fine stained glass, while the silver staff of William of Wykeham
is still preserved there. The cloisters are extensive and picturesque, the ribbed roof resembling
the bottom of a boat, while the restored hall has a fine oaken roof. The New College gardens
are enclosed on three sides by the ancient walls of the city, which are well preserved, and
the enclosure is one of the most beautiful in Oxford. Through a door in a corner of the gardens
there is a passageway opening out of one of the bastions of the old walls into a strip of ground
called the "Slype," where a fine view is had of the bastions, with the college bell-tower and
chapel behind them. In making a recent addition to the buildings of this college on the edge
of the "Slype," the workmen in digging for the foundations discovered the remains of a mammoth.

New College Lane leads to Radcliffe Square, in the centre of which is located the handsome
Radcliffe Library, with colleges, churches, and schools all around the square. Dr. Radcliffe,
who was the court-physician of King William III. and Queen Anne, founded this library, which
is in a handsome rotunda surmounted by a dome on an octagonal base. The structure, which is
one hundred feet in diameter, rises to a height of one hundred and forty feet, and from the
top there is a fine view of the city. To the northward, at a short distance, are the Schools,
a quadrangular building, now chiefly occupied by the famous Bodleian Library. From Radcliffe
Square the entrance is through a vaulted passage, the central gate-tower being a remarkable
example of the combination of the five orders of architecture piled one above the other. In
this building, on the lower floor, the public examinations of the candidates for degrees are
held, while above is the library which Sir Thomas Bodley founded in the sixteenth century,
and which contains three hundred thousand volumes, including many ancient and highly-prized
works in print and manuscript.

Lincoln College was founded by Richard Flemyng, Bishop of Lincoln, in 1427. Here John Wesley
was a member, and the pulpit from which he preached is still kept as a precious relic. Opposite
to Lincoln is Jesus College, founded by Queen Elizabeth in 1571, though others assisted; it
was intended to be exclusively for Welshmen, but this has since been changed. The chapel has
a double chancel. Alongside of Lincoln is Exeter College, founded by Walter Stapleton of Exeter
in 1314: this is one of the largest colleges, the greater part of the buildings being modern;
they are among the finest in Oxford. The hall, restored in the present century, has a high-pitched
timber roof, while the chapel, which is one of the most remarkable edifices in Oxford, has
a thin, small spire that is conspicuous from a great distance. The Ashmolean Museum adjoins
Exeter College, and next to this is the Sheldonian Theatre, built in 1669 by Archbishop Sheldon
of Canterbury, where the annual commemoration is held and the honorary degrees are conferred.
Not far away is Wadham College, founded in 1613 by Nicholas Wadham and Dorothy his wife. It
has excellent buildings and a most beautiful garden. There is a new Museum of Natural History
in the park near by, and also Keble College, founded in 1868 as a memorial of Rev. John Keble,
the author of the Christian Year. Its buildings are of variegated brick, the chapel being the
loftiest, most costly, and finest of its style in Oxford. The building is a perfect glare of
coloring.

Trinity College was founded in 1554 by Sir Thomas Pope. Its tower and chapel are Grecian, and
the chapel has a most beautiful carved screen and altarpiece. The library contains a chalice
that once belonged to St. Alban's Abbey. Kettel Hall, now a private dwelling, is a picturesque
building in front of Trinity. On Broad Street, where Trinity stands, is also Balliol College,
founded in the thirteenth century by John Balliol. None of the existing buildings are earlier
than the fifteenth century, while the south front, with its massive tower, has just been rebuilt.
It was here that the martyrs Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley were burned. A little farther along
the same street is St. John's College, which Sir Thomas White founded in 1557. It is fronted
by a terrace planted with fine elms. Its quadrangles and cloisters are much admired, especially
the venerable oriel windows and quaint stone gables of the library. St. John's gardens are
regarded as among the most attractive in Oxford. Opposite St. John's are the university galleries,
with their display of the Pomfret Marbles and Raphael and Michel Angelo's paintings and drawings,
and behind this building is Worcester College, founded in 1714 by Sir Thomas Cookes. Its gardens
contain a lake. Pembroke College is opposite Christ Church, and was founded in 1624 in honor
of the Earl of Pembroke, then the chancellor of the university. While its entrance-gateway
and hall, recently built, are fine, the other buildings are not attractive. The chief remembrance
of Pembroke is of Dr. Samuel Johnson, who occupied apartments over the original gateway, but
was compelled by poverty to leave the college before taking his degree. This completes the
description of the colleges, halls, and schools of the great university, which presents an
array of institutions of learning unrivalled in any part of the world, and of which Englishmen
are justly proud.

OXFORD CHURCHES AND CASTLE.

There are some fine churches in Oxford, notably the university church of St. Mary the Virgin,
conspicuous from its Decorated spire rising one hundred and eighty-eight feet, which is a memorial
of Queen Eleanor of Castile. A short distance to the westward is All Saints Church. Fronting
Christ Church is St. Aldate's Church, also with a lofty spire and Decorated tower. Like most
English towns, Oxford had a castle, but its remains are now reduced to a solitary tower, a
few fragments of wall, and a high mound. This castle has long been the property of Christ Church,
and was used for a prison, whence Cranmer and his fellow-martyrs went to the stake. The old
tower was built in the days of William Rufus. Beneath the ruins is a crypt known as Maud's
Chapel. In the centre of the mound is an octagonal vaulted chamber, approached by a long flight
of steps, and containing a well. It was in this castle that the empress Maud was besieged by
King Stephen in 1141, but escaped in the night, the castle surrendering next morning. The ground
was covered with snow at the time, and the empress, with three attendants, clad in white, passed
unnoticed through the lines of the besiegers and crossed the Thames on the ice. Just before
this Maud escaped from the castle of Devizes as a dead body drawn on a hearse. The castle of
Oxford has been in a dilapidated condition since Edward III.'s time. As an evidence of the
change of opinion, the Martyrs' Memorial stands on St. Giles Street in honor of the martyrs
who found the old tower of the castle their prison-house until the bigots of that day were
ready to burn them at the stake in front of Balliol College.

The intersection of the four principal streets of old Oxford makes what is called the Carfax
(a word derived from quatre voies), and here in the olden time stood a picturesque conduit.
Conduits in former years were ornaments in many English towns, and some of them still remain
in their original locations. This conduit, which stood in the way of traffic, was presented
as a nuisance as long ago as the time of Laud, and Lord Harcourt in 1787 removed it to his
park at Nuneham. One of the curious changes that have come over some Oxford landmarks is related
of a group of statues in the entrance to the Schools, where the Bodleian Library is located.
This group represents Mater Academia giving a book to King James I., sitting in his chair of
state, while winged Fame trumpets the gift throughout the world. When the king saw this, embellished
with appropriate mottoes, all of which were gloriously gilt, the ancient historian says he
exclaimed, "By my soul! this is too glorious for Jeamy," and caused the gilded mottoes to be
"whited out." Originally, the statue of the king held a sceptre in his right hand, and a book,
commonly taken for the Bible, in his left. Both have disappeared. The sceptre is said to have
fallen upon the passing of the Reform Bill, and the book came down about the time of the abolition
of the University Tests. The eastern part of Oxford is meadow-and garden-land, extending down
to the two famous rivers which unite just below the town, and along whose shores the racing-boats
in which the students take so much interest are moored. Pretty bridges span both streams, and
we follow down the Thames again, skirting along its picturesque shores past Iffley, with its
romantic old mill and the ancient church with its square tower rising behind, well-known landmarks
that are so familiar to boating-men, till we come to Nuneham Park, with the old Carfax Conduit
set on an eminence, and Blenheim Woods looming up in the background, as we look towards Oxford.

The church of Iffley is beautifully situated on the Thames, but little is known of its origin
or history. It was in existence in 1189, when King Henry II. died, and its architecture indicates
that it could scarcely have been built much before that time. It is an unusually good specimen
of the Norman style, and is in wonderful preservation, considering its age. This church is
peculiarly rich in its doorways, having three of great value, and each differing from the other.
The southern doorway is enriched with sculptured flowers, a style that is almost unique in
Norman architecture; it also contains rudely carved imitations of Roman centaurs. On the south
side of the church is an ancient cross and one of the most venerable yew trees in the kingdom,
in the trunk of which time has made a hollow where a man could easily conceal himself. There
is not on all the Thames a scene more loved by artists than that at Iffley, with its old mill
and church embosomed in foliage, and having an occasional fisherman lazily angling in the smooth
waters before them, while the Oxford oarsmen, some in fancy costumes, paddle by.

BANBURY AND BROUGHTON.

If we go up the Cherwell towards the northern part of Oxfordshire, a brief visit can be paid
to the famous town of Banbury, noted for its "castle, cross, and cakes." This was an ancient
Roman station, and the amphitheatre still exists just out of town. The castle was built in
the twelfth century, and many conflicts raged around it. Queen Elizabeth granted the castle
to Lord Saye and Sele, and one of his successors first organized the revolt against Charles
I. at his neighboring mansion of Broughton. Banbury was a great Puritan stronghold, and it
is related that when a book descriptive of Banbury was being printed in those days, it contained
a sentence describing Banbury as remarkable for its cheese, cakes, and ale. One Camden, looking
at the press while the sheet was being printed, thought this too light an expression, and changed
the word ale into zeal, so that the town became noted for Banbury zeal as well as cheese and
cakes. The old castle, after standing several desperate sieges, was demolished by the Puritans,
and nothing now remains excepting the moat and a small remnant of wall on which a cottage has
been built. The Banbury cakes are mentioned as early as 1686, and they are still in high repute,
being sent to all parts of the world. The Banbury cheese of which Shakespeare wrote is no longer
made. The Banbury cross has been immortalized in nursery-rhymes, but it was taken down by the
Puritans. The rhyme tells the little folk.

Diligent research has developed some important information about this fine lady. It appears
that in "the Second Edward's reign a knight of much renown, yclept Lord Herbert, chanced to
live near famous Banbury town." Now, this knight had one son left, and "fearless and brave
was he; and it raised the pride in the father's heart his gallant son to see." The poetic tale
goes on to relate "that near Lord Herbert's ancient hall proud Banbury Castle stood, within
the noble walls of which dwelt a maiden young and good;" with much more to the same effect.
There is the usual result: the knight loves the lady, has a mortal combat with the rival, and
nearly loses his life. The fair lady nurses him with care, but as he gradually sinks she loses
hope and pines away. A holy monk lived in the castle, and, noticing her despondency, offers
to effect a cure. He prescribes: "To-morrow, at the midnight hour, go to the cross alone: for
Edward's rash and hasty deed perhaps thou mayst atone." She goes there, walks around the cross,
and Edward is cured. Then all rejoice, and a festival is ordered, whereat,

  "Upon a milk-white steed, a lady doth appear:
  By all she's welcomed lustily in one tremendous cheer:
  With rings of brilliant lustre her fingers are bedecked,
  And bells upon her palfrey hung to give the whole effect."

A noble cavalier rode beside her, and the result has been

  "That even in the present time the custom's not forgot;
  But few there are who know the tale connected with the spot,
  Though to each baby in the land the nursery-rhymes are told
  About the lady robed in white and Banbury Cross of old."

Broughton Castle is a fine castellated mansion a short distance south-west of Banbury. It dates
from the Elizabethan era, and its owner, Viscount Saye and Sele, in Charles I.'s reign, thinking
that his services were not sufficiently rewarded, took the side of Parliament, in which his
son represented Banbury. When the king dissolved Parliament, it assembled clandestinely in
Broughton Castle. Here the Parliamentary leaders met in a room with thick walls, so that no
sounds could escape. Here also were raised the earliest troops for the Parliament, and the
"Blue-coats" of the Sayes were conspicuous at the battle of Edgehill, which was fought only
a few miles away. Immediately afterwards King Charles besieged Broughton Castle, captured and
plundered it. This famous old building witnessed in this way the earliest steps that led to
the English Revolution, and it is kept in quite good preservation. Subsequently, when Oliver
Cromwell became the leader of the Parliamentary party, he held his Parliament in Banbury at
the Roebuck Inn, a fine piece of architecture, with a great window that lights up one of the
best rooms in England of the earlier days of the Elizabethan era. A low door leads from the
courtyard to this noted council-chamber where Cromwell held his Parliament, and it remains
in much the same condition as then.

Through Oxfordshire is laid out one of those picturesque water-ways of the olden time--the
Berks and Wilts Canal--which, though almost superseded by the omnipresent railway, still exists
to furnish pretty scenery with its shady towing-paths and rustic swing-bridges. Almost the
only traffic that remains to this canal, which comes out upon the Thames near Oxford, is carrying
timber. The growth of English timber is slow, but some is still produced by the process of
thinning the woods so as to make shapely trees, for otherwise the tall trunks would force themselves
up almost without spreading branches.

WOODSTOCK AND BLENHEIM.

Not far away from Oxford is the manor of Woodstock, where "Fair Rosamond's Bower" was built
by King Henry II. This manor was an early residence of the kings of England, and Henry I. built
a palace there, adding to it a vast park. Of this palace not a sign is now to be seen, but
two sycamores have been planted to mark the spot. The poet Chaucer lived at Woodstock, and
is supposed to have taken much of the descriptive scenery of his Dream from the park. Edward
the Black Prince, son of Edward III., was born at Woodstock. Henry VII. enlarged the palace,
and put his name upon the principal gate; and this gate-house was one of the prisons of the
princess Elizabeth, where she was detained by her sister, Queen Mary. Elizabeth is said to
have written with charcoal on a window-shutter of her apartment, in 1555, a brief poem lamenting
her imprisonment. Her room had an arched roof formed of carved Irish oak and colored with blue
and gold, and it was preserved until taken down by Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough. In the Civil
War the palace was besieged, and after surrender, unlike most similar structures, escaped demolition.
Cromwell allotted it to three persons, two of whom pulled down their portions for the sake
of the stone.

In Queen Anne's reign Woodstock was granted to John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, for his
eminent military services. The condition of the grant, which is still scrupulously performed,
was that on August 2d in every year he and his heirs should present to the reigning monarch
at Windsor Castle one stand of colors, with three fleurs-de-lis painted thereon. The estate
was named Blenheim, after the little village on the Danube which was the scene of his greatest
victory on August 2, 1704. Ten years later, the duchess Sarah took down the remains of the
old palace of Woodstock, and Scott has woven its history into one of his later novels. Hardly
any trace remains of old Woodstock, and the only ruin of interest is a curious chimney-shaft
of the fourteenth century, which a probably inaccurate tradition says was part of the residence
of the Black Prince.

Woodstock Park covers twenty-seven hundred acres, and is nearly twelve miles in circuit, abounding
with fine trees and having an undulating surface, over which roam a large herd of deer and
a number of kangaroos. When the manor was granted to the Duke of Marlborough, Parliament voted
a sum of money to build him a palace "as a monument of his glorious actions." The park is entered
through a fine Corinthian gateway, built by the duchess Sarah in memory of her husband the
year after his death. A pretty stream of water, the river Glyme, with a lake, winds through
a valley in front of the palace, and is crossed by a stately stone bridge with a centre arch
of one hundred feet span. Not far from this bridge was Fair Rosamond's Bower, now marked by
a wall; beyond the bridge, standing on the lawn, is the Marlborough Column, a fluted Corinthian
pillar one hundred and thirty-four feet high, surmounted by the hero in Roman dress and triumphal
attitude. This monument to the great duke has an account of his victories inscribed on one
face of the pedestal, while on the others are the acts of Parliament passed in his behalf,
and an abstract of the entail of his estates and honors upon the descendants of his daughters.
Parliament voted $2,500,000 to build Blenheim Palace, to which the duke added $300,000 from
his own resources. The duke died seventeen years after the palace was begun, leaving it unfinished.
We are told that the trees in the park were planted according to the position of the troops
at Blenheim. The architect of the palace was John Vanbrugh, of whom the satirical epitaph was
written:

  "Lie heavy on him, Earth, for he
  Laid many a heavy load on thee."

The palace is a massive structure, with spacious portals and lofty towers, and its principal
front, which faces the north, extends three hundred and forty-eight feet from wing to wing,
with a portico and flight of steps in the centre. The interior is very fine, with magnificently-painted
ceilings, tapestries, statuary, and a rare collection of pictures. The tapestries represent
Blenheim and other battles, and there are one hundred and twenty copies of famous masters,
made by Teniers. A stately statue of Queen Anne stands in the library. There are costly collections
of enamels, plaques, and miniatures; on the walls are huge paintings by Sir James Thornhill,
one representing the great duke, in a blue cuirass, kneeling before Britannia, clad in white
and holding a lance and wreath; Hercules and Mars stand by, and there are emblem-bearing females
and the usual paraphernalia. We are told that Thornhill was paid for these at the rate of about
six dollars per square yard. The duchess Sarah also poses in the collection as Minerva, wearing
a yellow classic breastplate. Among other relics kept in the palace are Oliver Cromwell's teapot,
another teapot presented by the Duc de Richelieu to Louis XIV., two bottles that belonged to
Queen Anne, and some Roman and Grecian pottery. The great hall, which has the battle of Blenheim
depicted on its ceiling, extends the entire height of the building; the library is one hundred
and eighty-three feet long; and in the chapel, beneath a pompous marble monument, rest the
great duke and his proud duchess Sarah, and their two sons, who died in early years. The pleasure-gardens
extend over three hundred acres along the borders of the lake and river, and are very attractive.
They contain the Temple of Health erected on the recovery of George III. from his illness,
an aviary, a cascade elaborately constructed of large masses of rock, a fountain copied after
one in Rome, and a temple of Diana. This great estate was the reward of the soldier whose glories
were sung by Addison in his poem on the Campaign. Addison then lived in a garret up three pair
of stairs over a small shop in the Haymarket, London, whither went the Chancellor of the Exchequer
to get him to write the poem, and afterwards gave him a place worth $1000 a year as a reward.
The Marlboroughs since have been almost too poor to keep up this magnificent estate in its
proper style, for the family of Spencer-Churchill, which now holds the title, unlike most of
the other great English houses, has not been blessed with a princely private fortune. Not far
from Woodstock is Minster Lovel, near the village of Whitney. Some fragments of the house remain,
and it has its tale of interest, like all these old houses. Lord Lovel was one of the supporters
of the impostor Simnel against Henry VII., and his rebellion being defeated in the decisive
battle at Stoke in Nottinghamshire, Lord Lovel escaped by unfrequented roads and arrived home
at night. He was so disguised that he was only known by a single servant, on whose fidelity
he could rely. Before daybreak he retired to a subterranean recess, of which this servant retained
the key, and here he remained several months in safe concealment. The king confiscated the
estate, however, and dispersed the household, so that the voluntary prisoner perished from
hunger. During the last century, when this stately house was pulled down, the vault was discovered,
with Lord Lovel seated in a chair as he had died. So completely had rubbish excluded the air
that his dress, which was described as superb, and a prayer-book lying before him on the table,
were entire, but soon after the admission of the air the body is said to have fallen into dust.

BICESTER AND EYNSHAM.

A pleasant and old-fashioned town, not far away from Oxford, is Bicester, whereof one part
is known as the King's End and the other as the Market End. Here is the famous Bicester Priory,
founded in the twelfth century through the influence of Thomas à Becket. It was intended for
a prior and eleven canons, in imitation of Christ and his eleven disciples. The priory buildings
remained for some time after the dissolution of the religious houses, but they gradually disappeared,
and all that now exists is a small farm-house about forty feet long which formed part of the
boundary-wall of the priory, and is supposed to have been a lodge for the accommodation of
travellers. In the garden was a well of never-failing water held in high repute by pilgrims,
and which now supplies a fish-pond. The priory and its estates have passed in regular succession
through females from its founder, Gilbert Basset, to the Stanleys, and it is now one of the
possessions of the Earl of Derby. Bicester is an excellent specimen of an ancient English market-town,
and its curious block of market-buildings, occupied by at least twenty-five tenements, stands
alone and clear in the marketplace. There are antique gables, one of the most youthful of which
bears the date of 1698. On the top is a promenade used by the occupants in summer weather.
In the neighboring village of Eynsham is said to be the stone coffin that once held Fair Rosamond's
remains, but it has another occupant, one Alderman Fletcher having also been buried in it in
1826. Eynsham once had an abbey, of which still survives the shaft of a stone cross quaintly
carved with the figures of saints. It is a relic probably of the thirteenth century, but nothing
remains of the abbey beyond a few stones that may have belonged to it. It was near Eynsham,
not very long ago, that a strange dark-green water-plant first made its appearance in the Thames,
and spread so rapidly that it soon quite choked the navigation of the river, and from there
soon extended almost all over the kingdom. The meadows and the rivers became practically all
alike, a green expanse, in which from an eminence it was difficult to tell where the water-courses
lay. This plant was called the "American weed," the allegation being that it came over in a
cargo of timber from the St. Lawrence. It caused great consternation, but just when matters
looked almost hopeless it gradually withered and died, bringing the navigation welcome relief.

ABINGDON AND RADLEY.

Crossing over into Berkshire, we find, a short distance south of Oxford, on the bank of the
Thames, the ruins of the once extensive and magnificent Abingdon Abbey, founded in the seventh
century. It was here that Henry, the son of William the Conqueror, was educated and gained
his appellation of Beauclerc. The gatehouse still remains, and is at present devoted to the
use of fire-engines, but there is not much else remaining of the abbey save a remarkable chimney
and fireplace and some fragments of walls. We are told that the Saxons founded this abbey,
and that the Danes destroyed it, while King Alfred deprived the monks of their possessions,
but his grandson Ædred restored them. The abbey was then built, and became afterwards richly
endowed. For six centuries it was one of the great religious houses of this part of England;
and the Benedictines, true to their creed, toiled every day in the fields as well as prayed
in the church. They began the day by religious services; then assembled in the chapter-house,
where each was allotted his task and tools, and after a brief prayer they silently marched
out in double file to the fields. From Easter until October they were thus occupied from six
in the morning until ten o'clock, and sometimes until noon. Thus they promoted thrift, and
as their settlement extended it became the centre of a rich agricultural colony, for they often,
as their lands expanded, let them out to farmers. A short distance from Abingdon is Radley,
which was formerly the manor of the abbey, and contains a beautiful little church, wealthy
in its stores of rich woodwork and stained glass; it stands in the middle of the woods in a
charming situation, with picturesque elm trees overhanging the old Tudor building. Radley House
is now a training-school for Oxford, and it has a swimming-school attached, in which have been
prepared several of the most famous Oxford oarsmen, swimming being here regarded as a necessary
preliminary to boating. Near by is Bagley Wood, the delicious resort of the Oxonians which
Dr. Arnold loved so well. The village of Sunningwell, not far from Radley, also has a church,
and before its altar is the grave of Dean Fell, once its rector, who died of grief on hearing
of the execution of Charles I. From the tower of this church Friar Bacon, the hero of the story
of the brazen head, is said to have made astronomical observations: this renowned friar, Roger
Bacon, has come down to us as the most learned man that Oxford ever produced. Bacon's Study
was near the Folly Bridge, across the Thames on the road to Oxford, and it survived until 1779,
when it was taken down. Among the many legends told of Bacon is one that he used such skill
and magic in building the tower containing this study that it would have fallen on the head
of any one more learned than himself who might pass under it. Hence, freshmen on their arrival
at Oxford are carefully warned not to walk too near the Friar's Tower. Bacon overcame the greatest
obstacles in the pursuit of knowledge; he spent all his own money and all that he could borrow
in getting books and instruments, and then, renouncing the world, he became a mendicant monk
of the order of St. Francis. His Opus Majus--to publish which he and his friends pawned their
goods--was an epitome of all the knowledge of his time.

Other famous men came also from Abingdon. Edmund Rich, who did so much to raise the character
of Oxford in its earlier days, was born there about the year 1200; his parents were very poor,
and his father sought refuge in Eynsham Abbey. We are told that his mother was too poor to
furnish young Rich "with any other outfit than his horsehair shirt, which she made him promise
to wear every Wednesday, and which probably had been the cause of his father's retirement from
their humble abode." Rich went from Eynsham to Oxford, and soon became its most conspicuous
scholar; then he steadily advanced until he died the Archbishop of Canterbury. Chief-Justice
Holt, who reformed the legal procedure of England, was also a native of Abingdon; he admitted
prisoners to some rights, protected defendants in suits, and had the irons stricken off the
accused when brought into court, for in those days of the cruel rule of Judge Jeffreys the
defendant was always considered guilty until adjudged innocent. Holt originated the aphorism
that "slaves cannot breathe in England:" this was in the famous Somerset case, where a slave
was sold and the vendor sued for his money, laying the issues at Mary-le-Bow in London, and
describing the negro as "there sold and delivered." The chief-justice said that the action
was not maintainable, as the status of slavery did not exist in England. If, however, the claim
had been laid in Virginia, he said he would have been obliged to allow it; so that the decision
was practically on technical grounds. Lord Campbell sums up Holt's merits as a judge by saying
that he was not a statesman like Clarendon, or a philosopher like Bacon, or an orator like
Mansfield, yet his name is held in equal veneration with theirs, and some think him the most
venerated judge that ever was chief-justice. There is a really good story told of him by Lord
Campbell. In his younger days Holt was travelling in Oxfordshire, and stopped at an inn where
the landlady's daughter had an illness inducing fits. She appealed to him, and he promised
to work a cure: which he did by writing some Greek words on a piece of parchment and telling
her to let her daughter wear the charm around her neck. Partly from the fact that the malady
had spent itself, and possibly also from the effect of her imagination, the girl entirely recovered.
Years rolled on and he became the lord chief-justice, when one day a withered old woman was
brought before the assizes for being a witch, and it was proven that she pretended to cure
all manner of cattle diseases, and with a charm that she kept carefully wrapped in a bundle
of rags. The woman told how the charm many years before had cured her daughter, and when it
was unfolded and handed to the judge he remembered the circumstance, recognized his talisman,
and ordered her release.

CAVERSHAM AND READING ABBEY.

As we continue the journey down the Thames the shores on either hand seem cultivated like gardens,
with trim hedgerows dividing them, pretty villages, cottages gay with flowers and evergreens,
spires rising among the trees; and the bewitching scene reminds us of Ralph Waldo Emerson's
tribute to the English landscape, that "it seems to be finished with the pencil instead of
the plough." The surface of the river is broken by numerous little "aits" or islands. We pass
the little old house and the venerable church embosomed in the rural beauties of Clifton-Hampden.
We pass Wallingford and Goring, and come to Pangbourne and Whitchurch, where the little river
Pang flows in between green hills. Each village has the virtue that Dr. Johnson extolled when
he said that "the finest landscape in the world is improved by a good inn in the foreground."
Then we come to Mapledurham and Purley, where Warren Hastings lived, and finally halt at Caversham,
known as the port of Reading. Here the Thames widens, and here in the olden time was the little
chapel with a statue of the Virgin known as the "Lady of Caversham," which was reputed to have
wrought many miracles and was the shrine for troops of pilgrims. In Cromwell's day the chapel
was pulled down, and the statue, which was plated over with silver, was boxed up and sent to
the Lord Protector in London. They also had here many famous relics, among them the spear-head
that pierced the Saviour's side, which had been brought there by a "one-winged angel." The
officer who destroyed the chapel, in writing a report of the destruction to Cromwell, expressed
his regret at having missed among the relics "a piece of the holy halter Judas was hanged withal."
Lord Cadogan subsequently built Caversham House for his residence. Reading, which is the county-town
of Berkshire, is not far away from Caversham, and is now a thriving manufacturing city, its
most interesting relic being the hall of the ancient Reading Abbey, built seven hundred years
ago. It was one of the wealthiest in the kingdom, and several parliaments sat in the hall.
The ruins, still carefully preserved, show its extent and fine Norman architecture.

The Thames flows on past Sonning, where the Kennet joins it, a stream "for silver eels renowned,"
as Pope tells us. Then the Lodden comes in from the south, and we enter the fine expanse of
Henley Reach, famous for boat-racing. It is a beautiful sheet of water, though the university
race is now rowed farther down the river and nearer London, at Putney. Our boat now drifts
with the stream through one of the most beautiful portions of the famous river, past Medmenham
Abbey and Cliefden to Maidenhead. Here for about ten miles is a succession of beauties of scenery
over wood and cliff and water that for tranquil loveliness cannot be surpassed anywhere. Who
has not heard of the charming rocks and hanging woods of Cliefden, with the Duke of Westminster's
mansion standing on their pinnacle?

THE VICAR OF BRAY.

We come to Maidenhead and Taplow, with Brunel's masterpiece of bridge-building connecting them,
its elliptical brick arches being the broadest of their kind in the kingdom. Below this, as
beauties decrease, we are compensated by scenes of greater historical interest. Near Maidenhead
is Bisham Abbey, the most interesting house in Berkshire. It was originally a convent, and
here lived Sir Thomas Russel, who at one time was the custodian of the princess Elizabeth.
He treated her so well that she warmly welcomed him at court after becoming queen.

Bisham is a favorite scene for artists to sketch. Bray Church, where officiated the famous
"Vicar of Bray," Symond Symonds, is below Maidenhead. Having seen martyrs burnt at Windsor,
but two miles off, he found the fires too hot for his tender temper, and therefore changed
his religion whenever events changed his sovereign. When taxed with being a religious changeling,
his shrewd answer was, "Not so, for I always keep my principle, which is this--to live and
to die the Vicar of Bray." The old church, nestling among the trees, is attractive, and we
are told that an ancient copy of Fox's Book of Martyrs, which was chained to the reading-desk
in Queen Elizabeth's time, is still preserved here for the edification of the faithful.

ETON COLLEGE.

Soon the famous Eton College comes into view on the northern bank of the river--an institution
dear to the memory of many English schoolboys. The village consists of a long, narrow street
which is extended across an iron bridge to Windsor, on the southern bank of the Thames. Henry
VI. founded the "College of the Blessed Mary of Eton beside Windsor" as early as 1440. The
older parts of the buildings are of red brick, with stone dressings and quaint, highly ornamental
chimneys, and they are clustered around two quadrangles. Here are the Lower and Upper Schools
and the Long Chamber. About thirty-five years ago fine new buildings were erected in similar
style to the old buildings, which provide a beautiful chapel, schools, and library (though
books are said to be scarce there), and extensive dormitories. Adjoining them to the north-east
are the Playing Fields on the broad green meadows along the river's edge, with noble elms shading
them. In the Upper School of the ancient structure high wooden panelling covers the lower part
of the walls, deeply scarred with the names of generations of Eton boys crowded closely together.
In earlier times all used to cut their names in the wood, but now this sculpturing is only
permitted to those who attain a certain position and leave without dishonor. Thus the panelling
has become a great memorial tablet, and above it, upon brackets, are busts of some of the more
eminent Etonians, including the Duke of Wellington, Pitt, Fox, Hallam, Fielding, and Gray.
In the library are kept those instruments of chastisement which are always considered a part
of schoolboy training, though a cupboard hides them from view--all but the block whereon the
victim kneels preliminary to punishment. More than once have the uproarious boys made successful
raids and destroyed this block or carried it off as a trophy. But vigorous switching was more
a habit at Eton in former days than it is now. Of Head-master Keate, who was a famous flogger
a half century ago, and would frequently practise on a score of boys at one séance, the scholars
made a calculation to prove that he spent twice as much time in chastisement as in church,
and it is recorded that he once flogged an entire division of eighty boys without an intermission.
On another occasion he flogged, by mistake, a party who had been sent him for confirmation.
Tall stories are also told of Eton flogging and "rug-riding"--the latter being a process whereby
a heavy boy was dragged on a rug over the floors to polish them. Down to 1840 the Eton dinners
consisted entirely of mutton, with cold mutton served up for supper, but this regulation diet
is now varied with an occasional service of beef and other courses. Games are no inconsiderable
part of the English schoolboy's education, and the Duke of Wellington said that in the "Playing
Fields" of Eton the battle of Waterloo was won. These fields, "where all unconscious of their
doom the little victims play," contain one of the finest cricket-grounds in England. The boys
divide themselves into "dry bobs" and "wet bobs," the former devoted to cricket and the latter
to boating. The procession of the boats is the great feature of June 4th, the "Speech Day."
Of late years the Eton volunteer corps has attained great proficiency, being a battalion of
over three hundred of the larger boys. This famous college is one of the preparatory schools
for the universities. It is a world in miniature, where the boy finds his own level, and is
taught lessons of endurance, patience, self-control, and independence which stand him in good
service throughout after-life.

WINDSOR CASTLE.

Across the Thames, on the southern bank, the antique and noble towers of Windsor Castle now
rise high above the horizon. This is the sovereign's rural court, and is probably the best
known by the world of all the English castles. The name is given various derivations: some
ascribe it to the river's winding course; others to "Wind us over," in allusion to a rope-ferry
there in ancient times; others to "Wind is sore," as the castle stands high and open to the
weather. From the Saxon days Windsor has been a fortress, but the present castle owes its beginning
to Edward III., who was born at Windsor and built its earliest parts, commencing with the great
Round Tower in 1315. The ransoms of two captive kings, John of France and David of Scotland,
paid for the two higher wards. It was at Windsor that King Edward instituted the Order of the
Garter, which is the highest British order of knighthood. Being impressed with the charms of
Alice, Countess of Salisbury, but she resisting his advances, out of the gallantries of their
coquetry came the circumstance of the king's picking up her garter dropped at a ball and presenting
it to her. Froissart, in giving the legend telling of this institution of the Garter, says
that it arose out of the chivalrous self-denial that leads virtue to subdue passion. Henry
VI. was born at Windsor; Edward IV. added St. George's Chapel to the castle; Henry VII. built
the Tomb House, and Henry VIII. the gateway to the Lower Ward; Queen Elizabeth added the gallery
of the north terrace; and in Charles II.'s reign the fortress, which it had been until that
time, was converted into a sort of French palace. Thus it remained until George IV., in 1824,
thoroughly restored it at a cost of $7,500,000. The great gateways are known as Henry VIII.'s,
St. George's, and King George IV.'s, while within is the Norman or Queen Elizabeth's Gate.
The Round Tower or Keep was built for the assemblage of a fraternity of knights which King
Edward intended to model after King Arthur's "Knights of the Round Table," but the project
was abandoned after the institution of the Order of the Garter.

The Round Tower stands upon an artificial mound, and what was formerly its surrounding ditch
is now a sunken garden. From its commanding battlements twelve counties can be seen, and the
Prince of Wales is constable of this tower, as indeed of the whole castle. This fine old keep
was the castle-prison from the time of Edward III. to that of Charles II. The poet-king, James
I. of Scotland, captured when ten years old by Henry IV., was the first prisoner of note. Here
he fell in love with Jane Beaufort, daughter of the Duke of Somerset, and he tells in a quaint
poem the romance which ended in her becoming his queen. Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, brought
to the block by Henry VIII., was also confined there, and he too lamented his captivity in
poetry. From the top of the keep the dome of St. Paul's in London can be seen. The castle was
mercilessly plundered in the Civil Wars, till Cromwell interfered for its protection. In its
present condition the castle has three grand divisions in the palatial parts--the state apartments,
looking north; the queen's private apartments, looking east; and the visitors' apartments,
looking south. The south and east sides of the quadrangle contain over three hundred and seventy
rooms. Southward of the castle is the Windsor Great Park, to which the "Long Walk," said to
be the finest avenue of the kind in Europe, runs in a straight line for three miles from the
principal entrance of the castle to the top of a commanding eminence in the park called Snow
Hill. Double rows of stately elms border the "Long Walk" on either hand, and it terminates
at the fine bronze equestrian statue of George III., standing on the highest part of Snow Hill.

St. George's Chapel, a beautiful structure of the Perpendicular Gothic, was begun four hundred
years ago, and contains the tomb of Edward IV., who built it. In 1789, more than three hundred
years after his interment, the leaden coffin of the king was found in laying a new pavement.
The skeleton is said to have been seven feet long, and Horace Walpole got a lock of the king's
hair. Here also lie Henry VI., Henry VIII., and Charles I. The latter's coffin was opened in
1813, and the king's remains were found in fair preservation. The close companionship of Henry
VIII. and Charles in death is thus described by Byron:

  "Famed for contemptuous breach of sacred ties,
  By headless Charles see heartless Henry lies."

The tradition of "Herne the Hunter," which Shakespeare gives in the Merry Wives of Windsor,
is said to be founded on the fact that Herne, a keeper of Windsor Forest, having committed
some offence, hanged himself upon an oak tree. His ghost afterwards was to be seen, with horns
on its head, walking round about this oak in the neighborhood of the castle.

SOME RIVER SCENES.

Just below Windsor the Thames passes between Runnimede, the "Meadow of Council," where the
barons encamped, and Magna Charta Island, where King John signed the great charter of English
liberty. The river sweeps in a tranquil bend around the wooded isle, where a pretty little
cottage has been built which is said to contain the very stone whereon the charter was signed.
The river Coln falls into the Thames, and "London Stone" marks the entrance to Middlesex and
the domain of the metropolis. We pass Staines and Chertsey, where the poet Cowley lived, and
then on the right hand the river Wey comes in at Weymouth. Many villages are passed, and at
a bend in the Thames we come to the place where Cæsar with his legions forded the river at
Cowey Stakes, defeated Cassivelaunus, and conquered Britain. In his Commentaries Julius Cæsar
writes that he led his army to the Thames, which could be crossed on foot at one place only,
and there with difficulty. On arriving, he perceived great forces of the enemy drawn up on
the opposite bank, which was fortified by sharp stakes set along the margin, a similar stockade
being fixed in the bed of the river and covered by the stream. These facts being ascertained
from prisoners and deserters, Cæsar sent the cavalry in front and ordered the legions to follow
immediately. The soldiers advanced with such impetuosity, although up to their necks in the
water, that the Britons could not withstand the onset and fled. A couple of miles below, at
Hampton, Garrick lived in a mansion fronted by a rotunda with a Grecian portico. We pass Hampton
Court and Bushey Park, which revive memories of Wolsey, Cromwell, and William III., and then
on the opposite bank see the two charming Dittons--"Thames" and "Long" Ditton--of which Theodore
Hook has written:

  "When sultry suns and dusty streets proclaim town's 'winter season,'
  And rural scenes and cool retreats sound something like high treason,
  I steal away to shades serene which yet no bard has hit on,
  And change the bustling, heartless scene for quietude and Ditton.

  "Here, in a placid waking dream, I'm free from worldly troubles,
  Calm as the rippling silver stream that in the sunshine bubbles;
  And when sweet Eden's blissful bowers some abler bard has writ on,
  Despairing to transcend his powers, I'll ditto say for Ditton."

Then we pass Kingston, where several Saxon kings were crowned, and the coronation-stone, marked
with their names, it is said, still remains in the market-place. Teddington Lock is the last
upon the Thames, and a mile below is Eel-Pie Island, lying off Twickenham, renowned for the
romance that surrounds its ancient ferry. Near here lived the eccentric Horace Walpole, at
Strawberry Hill, while in Twickenham Church is the monument to the poet Pope, which states
in its inscription that he would not be buried in Westminster Abbey. Pope's villa no longer
exists, and only a relic of his famous grotto remains. The widening Thames, properly named
the Broadwater, now sweeps on to Richmond, and if that far-famed hill is climbed, it discloses
one of the finest river-views in the world.

LONDON.

Here ends the romantic portion of the Thames. The beauty of Nature is no longer present, being
overtopped by the stir and roar of the great Babel, for the metropolis has reached out and
swallowed up the suburban villages, although some of the picturesque scenes remain. Many bridges
span the river, which on either hand gradually transforms its garden-bordered banks into the
city buildings, and the Thames itself bears on its bosom the valuable commerce that has chiefly
made the great capital. When King James I. threatened recalcitrant London with the removal
of his court to Oxford, the lord mayor sturdily yet sarcastically replied, "May it please Your
Majesty, of your grace, not to take away the Thames too?" This river, so beautiful in its upper
loveliness, stands alone in the far-reaching influence of the commerce that its lower waters
bear. It has borne us from the Cotswolds to London; while to properly describe the great city
would take volumes in itself. Without attempting such a task, we will only give a brief summary
of some of the more striking objects of interest that the great British metropolis presents.

The origin of the vast city whose population now approximates four millions is obscure. It
was a British settlement before the Romans came to England, and its name of Llyn Dyn, the "City
of the Lake," was transformed by the conquerors into Londinium. When Cæsar crossed the Thames
he thought the settlement of too little importance for mention, and it does not seem to have
been occupied as a Roman station until a century afterwards, and was not walled round until
A.D. 306. The old wall was about three miles in circumference, beginning near the present site
of the Tower, and some slight traces of it remain. The "London Stone" on Cannon Street was
the central stone or milliarium from which distances were measured and the great Roman highways
started. A worn fragment of this stone, protected by iron bars, now stands against the wall
of St. Swithin's Church. When Jack Cade entered London, Shakespeare tells us, he struck his
sword on this stone and exclaimed, "Now is Mortimer lord of this city." Wren caused it to be
encased, for protection, with a new stone hollowed for the purpose; it now stands very near
its original position. London in the sixth century became the capital of the Saxon kingdom
of Essex, and in the ninth century the Danes destroyed it. King Alfred a few years afterwards
rebuilt London, but it stood barely seven years when it was burned. Finally, it was again rebuilt,
and again captured by the Danes, Canute setting himself up as king there. Some relics of these
Danes remain. St. Olaf was their saint, and Tooley Street is but a corruption of his name.
They had a church and burial-place where now St. Clement-Danes stands awry on the Strand--a
church that is of interest not only on its own account, but for the venerable antiquity it
represents. The Saxons drove out the Danes, and the Normans in turn conquered the Saxons, the
Tower of London coming down to us as a relic of William the Conqueror, who granted the city
the charter which is still extant. Henry I. gave it a new charter, which is said to have been
the model for Magna Charta. In the twelfth century London attained the dignity of having a
lord mayor. It sided with the House of York in the Wars of the Roses, and in Elizabeth's reign
had about one hundred and fifty thousand population, being then about two miles south of Westminster,
with fields between, and having the Tower standing apart from the city farther down the Thames.
The plague devastated it in 1665, carrying off sixty thousand persons, and next year the Great
Fire occurred, which destroyed five-sixths of the city within the walls, and burned during
four days. This fire began at Pudding Lane, Monument Yard, and ended at Pie Corner, Giltspur
Street. To commemorate the calamity the Monument was erected on Fish Street Hill, on the site
of St. Margaret's Church, which was destroyed. It is a fluted Doric column of Portland stone,
erected by Wren at a cost of $70,000, and is two hundred and two feet high.

A vase of flames forty two feet high, made of gilt bronze, crowns the apex, up to which leads
a winding staircase of three hundred and forty-five steps. The structure has often been compared
to a lighted candle, and the balcony at the top, having been selected as a favorite place for
suicides to jump from, is now encaged with iron-work to prevent this.

London was rebuilt in four years after the Great Fire, and the first stone of the new St. Paul's
was laid in 1675, when the city had, with the outlying parishes, a half million population.
Its growth was slow until after the American Revolution, and it began the present century with
about eight hundred thousand people. The past seventy years have witnessed giant strides, and
it has made astonishing progress in the elegance of its parks and new streets and the growth
of adornments and improvements of all kinds. London has become, in fact, a world within itself.

ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.

Among a multitude of famous objects in London, three stand out boldly prominent--St. Paul's
Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, and the Tower. St. Paul's, the cathedral church of the bishops
of London, is the finest building in the Italian style in Great Britain; but, unfortunately,
in consequence of the nearness of the surrounding houses, no complete general view is attainable.
The first church was built there by King Ethelbert in 610; it was destroyed by fire in the
eleventh century, and then old St. Paul's was built, suffering repeatedly from fire and lightning,
and being finally destroyed by the Great Fire of 1666. It was a large church, with a spire
rising five hundred and twenty feet. The money-lenders and small dealers plied their vocations
in its middle aisle, known as Paul's Walk, while tradespeople took possession of the vaults
and cloisters, a baker made a hole in a buttress for his bakeoven, and several buildings were
planted against the outer walls, one being used as a theatre. The ruins were not disturbed
for eight years after the fire, when Wren began rebuilding, the cathedral being finished in
thirty-five years. The architect, bishop, and master-mason who laid the corner-stone were all
living at the completion--a singular circumstance. Wren got $1000 a year salary, and for this,
said the Duchess of Marlborough, he was content to be dragged up to the top in a basket three
or four times a week. The building cost $3,740,000, chiefly raised by subscription. It is the
fifth of the churches of Christendom in size, being excelled by St. Peter's and the cathedrals
at Florence, Amiens, and Milan. In ground plan it is a Latin cross five hundred feet long,
with a transept of two hundred and fifty feet in length; the nave and choir are one hundred
and twenty-five feet wide and the sides one hundred feet high. The majestic dome, which is
the glory of the cathedral, rises three hundred and sixty-five feet, and the surmounting lantern
carries a gilt copper ball and cross. The grand front towards the west, facing Ludgate Hill,
is approached by a double flight of steps from an area which contains a statue of Queen Anne.
The portico is in two divisions, with Corinthian columns supporting the pediment, which bears
a bas-relief of the conversion of St. Paul, and has a statue of St. Paul at the apex, with
statues of St. Peter at the sides. Bell-towers rise from each side of the portico to a height
of two hundred and twenty feet, surmounted by domes. The large bell, "Great Paul," which has
just been placed in the tower, is the heaviest in England, weighing nearly seventeen tons.
Within the cathedral the cupola has a diameter of one hundred and eight feet, and rises two
hundred and twenty-eight feet above the pavement; around it runs the famous Whispering Gallery.
Beneath the centre of the pavement lie the remains of Lord Nelson in the crypt, for St. Paul's
has been made the mausoleum of British heroes on sea and land. Here, among others, are monuments
to Napier, Ponsonby, Cornwallis, Nelson, Howe, Collingwood, Pakenham, Sir John Moore, Abercrombie,
Rodney, St. Vincent, and also a noble porphyry mausoleum for the Duke of Wellington. Some of
the heroes of peace also have monuments in St. Paul's, among them Dr. Johnson, Howard the philanthropist,
Sir Astley Cooper the surgeon, Bishop Middleton, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Turner, Rennie the engineer,
and also Wren. The memory of the great architect is marked by a marble slab, with the inscription,
"Reader, do you ask his monument? Look around."

The outside elevation of the cathedral is of two orders of architecture--the lower, Corinthian,
having windows with semicircular headings, while the upper, Composite, has niches corresponding
to the windows below. The entablature of each story is supported by coupled pilasters, while
the north and south walls are surmounted by balustrades. Each arm of the transept is entered
by an external semicircular portico, reached by a lofty staircase. Above the dome is the Golden
Gallery, whence there is a grand view around London, if the atmosphere permits, which it seldom
does. Above the lantern is the ball, weighing fifty-six hundred pounds; above this the cross,
weighing thirty-three hundred and sixty pounds.

WESTMINSTER ABBEY.

This is the most renowned church in England, for in it her sovereigns have been crowned, and
many of them buried, from the days of Harold to Victoria, and it contains the graves of her
greatest men in statesmanship, literature, science, and art. The abbey is the collegiate church
of St. Peter's, Westminster, and stands not far away from the Thames, near Westminster Hall
and the Parliament Houses. Twelve hundred years ago its site was an island in the Thames known
as Thorney Island, and a church was commenced there by Sebert, king of Essex, but was not completed
until three centuries afterwards, in the reign of King Edgar, when it was named the "minster
west of St. Paul's," or Westminster. The Danes destroyed it, and Edward the Confessor rebuilt
it in the eleventh century. Portions of this church remain, but the present abbey was begun
by Henry III. nearly seven hundred years ago, and it was not completed until Edward III.'s
time. Henry VII. removed the Lady Chapel, and built the rich chapel at the east end which is
named after him. Wren ultimately made radical changes in it, and in 1714, after many changes,
the abbey finally assumed its present form and appearance. It has had a great history, the
coronations alone that it has witnessed being marked events. They usually were followed by
banquets in Westminster Hall, but over $1,300,000 having been wasted on the display and banquet
for George IV., they were discontinued afterwards. At Queen Victoria's coronation the crown
was imposed in front of the altar before St. Edward's Chapel, the entire nave, choir, and transepts
being filled by spectators, and the queen afterwards sitting upon a chair which, with the raised
platform bearing it, was covered with a cloth of gold. Here she received the homage of her
officers and the nobility. The ancient coronation-chair, which is probably the greatest curiosity
in the abbey, is a most unpretentious and uncomfortable-looking old high-backed chair with
a hard wooden seat. Every sovereign of England has been crowned in it since Edward I. There
is a similar chair alongside it, the duplicate having been made for the coronation of William
and Mary, when two chairs were necessary, as both king and queen were crowned and vested with
equal authority. Underneath the seat of the coronation-chair is fastened the celebrated Stone
of Scone, a dark-looking, old, rough, and worn-edged rock about two feet square and six inches
thick. All sorts of legends are told of it, and it is said to have been a piece of Jacob's
Pillar. Edward I. brought it from Scotland, where many generations had done it reverence, and
the old chair was made to contain it in 1297. These priceless accessories of the coronation
ceremony, which will some day do service for the Prince of Wales, are kept alongside the tomb
of Edward the Confessor, which for centuries has been the shrine of pilgrims, and they are
guarded by the graves of scores of England's kings and queens and princes.

The abbey's ground-plan has the form of a Latin cross, which is apsidal, having radiating chapels.
Henry VII.'s Chapel prolongs the building eastward from the transept almost as much as the
nave extends westward. Cloisters adjoin the nave, and the western towers, built by Wren, rise
two hundred and twenty-five feet, with a grand window beneath them. The church is five hundred
and thirty feet long. The nave is one hundred and sixty-six feet long and one hundred and two
feet high; the choir, one hundred and fifty-five long; the transept, two hundred and three
feet long, and on the south arm one hundred and sixty-five feet high. A great rose-window,
thirty feet in diameter, is in the north end of the transept, with a fine portico, beneath
which is the beautiful gateway of the abbey. In the interior the height of the roof is remarkable,
and also the vast number of monuments, there being hundreds of them. Magnificent woodwork in
carving and tracery adorns the choir, and its mosaic pavement comes down to us from the thirteenth
century, the stones and workmen to construct it having been brought from Rome. The fine stained-glass
windows are chiefly modern. But the grand contemplation in Westminster Abbey is the graves
of the famous dead that have been gathering there for nearly eight centuries. No temple in
the world can present anything like it. Wordsworth has written:

               ----"Be mine in hours of fear
  Or grovelling thought to find a refuge here,
  Or through the aisles of Westminster to roam,
  Where bubbles burst, and folly's dancing foam
  Melts if it cross the threshold--where the wreath
  Of awestruck wisdom droops."

Of the nine chapels surrounding the east end of the abbey, the most interesting are those of
Edward the Confessor, beyond the altar, and of Henry VII., at the extreme eastern end. The
shrine of King Edward above referred to occupies the centre of his chapel, and was formerly
richly inlaid with mosaics and precious stones, which, however, have been carried off. Henry
VII.'s Chapel is a fine specimen of the architecture of his time, and the monuments of Queens
Elizabeth and Mary of Scotland are in the north and south aisles. In the south transept is
the Poets' Corner, with monuments to all the great poets, and here, as well as in nave and
choir and the north transept, are monuments of hundreds of illustrious Englishmen. In making
these burials there is a sort of method observed. Chaucer's interment in the Poets' Corner
in 1400 led the south transept to be devoted to literary men. The north transept is devoted
to statesmen, the first distinguished burial there being the elder Pitt in 1778. The organ
is on the north side of the nave, and here the eminent musicians repose. In the side chapels
the chief nobles are buried, and in the chancel and its adjoining chapels the sovereigns. Isaac
Newton in 1727 was the first scientist buried in the nave, and that part has since been devoted
to scientific men and philanthropists. Probably the finest tomb in the abbey is that of the
elder Pitt, which bears the inscription, "Erected by the King and Parliament as a testimony
to the virtues and ability of William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, during whose administration, in
the reigns of George II. and George III., Divine Providence exalted Great Britain to a height
of prosperity and glory unknown to any former age." One of the finest of the stained-glass
windows in the nave is the double memorial window in memory of the poets Herbert and Cowper,
erected by an American, George W. Childs. George III. and the British sovereigns since his
reign have their tombs at Windsor, preferring that noble castle for their last resting-place.

Upon the east side of the abbey is St. Margaret's, the special church of the House of Commons.
Its east window contains the celebrated stained-glass representation of the Crucifixion, painted
in Holland, which General Monk buried to keep the Puritans from destroying. Sir Walter Raleigh
is entombed here, and an American subscription has placed a stained-glass window in the church
to his memory, inscribed with these lines by James Russell Lowell:

  "The New World's sons, from England's breasts we drew
    Such milk as bids remember whence we came.
  Proud of her past, wherefrom our present grew,
    This window we inscribe with Raleigh's name."

THE TOWER OF LONDON.

On the northern bank of the Thames, standing in a somewhat elevated position a short distance
east of the ancient city-walls, is the collection of buildings known as the Tower. The enclosure
covers about twelve acres, encircled by a moat now drained, and a battlemented wall from which
towers rise at intervals. Within is another line of walls with towers, called the Inner Ballium,
having various buildings interspersed. In the enclosed space, rising high above all its surroundings,
is the great square White Tower, which was the keep of the old fortress. Tradition assigns
a very early date to this stronghold, but the written records do not go back earlier than William
the Conqueror, who built the White Tower about 1078. It was enlarged and strengthened by subsequent
kings, and Stephen kept his court there in the twelfth century. The moat was made about 1190.
Edward II.'s daughter was born there, and was known as Joan of the Tower. Edward III. imprisoned
Kings David of Scotland and John of France there. Richard II. in Wat Tyler's rebellion took
refuge in the Tower with his court and nobles, numbering six hundred persons, and in 1399 was
imprisoned there and deposed. Edward IV. kept a splendid court in the Tower, and Henry VI.,
after being twice a prisoner there, died in the Tower in 1471. There also was the Duke of Clarence
drowned in a butt of Malmsey wine, and the two youthful princes, Edward V. and his brother,
were murdered at the instance of Richard III. Henry VII. made the Tower often his residence.
Henry VIII. received there in state all his wives before their marriages, and two of them,
Anne Boleyn and Catharine Howard, were beheaded there. Here the Protector Somerset, and afterwards
Lady Jane Grey, were beheaded. The princess Elizabeth was imprisoned in the Tower, and James
I. was the last English sovereign who lived there. The palace, having become ruinous, was ultimately
taken down. The Tower during the eight hundred years it has existed has contained a legion
of famous prisoners, and within its precincts Chaucer, who held an office there in Richard
II.'s reign, composed his poem The Testament of Love, and Sir Walter Raleigh wrote his History
of the World.

The "Yeomen of the Guard," a corps of forty-eight warders, who are meritorious soldiers, dressed
in the uniform of Henry VIII.'s reign on state occasions, and at other times wearing black
velvet hats and dark-blue tunics, have charge of the exhibition of the Tower. The entrance
is in a small building on the western side, where years ago the lions were kept, though they
have since been all sent to the London Zoological Garden. From this originated the phrase "going
to see the lions." At the centre of the river-front is the "Traitor's Gate," through which
persons charged with high treason were formerly taken into the Tower. It is a square building
erected over the moat, and now contains a steam pumping-engine. Opposite it is the Bloody Tower,
where the young princes were smothered and where Raleigh was confined. Adjoining is the Wakefield
Tower, with walls thirteen feet thick. Passing through the Bloody Tower gateway to the interior
enclosure, a large number of curious guns are seen, and the Horse Armory at the base of the
White Tower is filled with specimens of ancient armor artistically arranged. In this collection
the systems of armor can be traced from the time of Edward I. to that of James II., and there
are suits that were worn by several famous kings and warriors. Above, in Queen Elizabeth's
Armory, is more armor, and also trophies of Waterloo and other battles, and a collection of
every kind of weapon in the Tower. There are also specimens of instruments of torture and many
other curiosities on exhibition.

The White Tower, which has walls fourteen feet thick in some parts, covers a space one hundred
and sixteen by ninety-six feet, and is ninety-two feet high, with turrets at the angles. Each
floor is divided into three rooms, with stone partitions seven feet thick. On the second floor
is St. John's Chapel, and on the third the council-chamber of the early kings, with a dark,
massive timber roof; in this chamber Richard II. resigned his crown; it is now filled with
a vast collection of arms. The Salt Tower, which is at an angle of the enclosure, was formerly
a prison; and in another part of the grounds is the Jewel House, where the crown jewels are
kept; they are in a glass case, protected by an iron cage, and the house was built for them
in 1842. Queen Victoria's state crown, made in 1838, after her coronation, is the chief. It
consists of diamonds, pearls, sapphires, rubies, and emeralds set in silver and gold, and has
a crimson velvet cap with carmine border, lined with white silk. It contains the famous ruby
given to Edward the Black Prince by the King of Castile, and which is surrounded by diamonds
forming a Maltese cross. The jewels in this crown are one large ruby, one large sapphire, sixteen
other sapphires, eleven emeralds, four rubies, one thousand three hundred and sixty-three brilliant
diamonds, one thousand two hundred and seventy-three rose diamonds, one hundred and forty-seven
table diamonds, and two hundred and seventy-seven pearls. Among the other crowns is St. Edward's
crown, of gold embellished with diamonds, used at all coronations, when it is placed upon the
sovereign's head by the Archbishop of Canterbury. This crown was stolen from the Tower by Blood
in 1761. There are also the Prince of Wales' crown, the queen's crown, the queen's diadem,
St. Edward's Staff, four feet seven inches long, made of beaten gold and surmounted by an orb
said to contain part of the true cross, and carried before the sovereign at coronation; the
royal sceptre (surmounted by a cross), which the archbishop places in the sovereign's right
hand at coronation; the rod of equity (surmounted by a dove), which he places in the left hand;
several other sceptres; the pointless sword of Mercy, the swords of Justice, and the sacred
vessels used at coronation. Here is also the famous Koh-i-noor diamond, the "Mountain of Light,"
which was taken at Lahore in India. The ancient Martin or Jewel Tower, where Anne Boleyn was
imprisoned, is near by; the barracks are on the north side of the Tower, and behind them are
the Brick and Bowyer Towers, in the former of which Lady Jane Grey was imprisoned, and in the
latter the Duke of Clarence was drowned; but only the basements of the old towers remain. The
Tower Chapel, or church of St. Peter's, was used for the cemetery of the distinguished prisoners
who were beheaded there, and in its little graveyard lie scores of headless corpses, as well
as the remains of several constables of the Tower. In front of it was the place of execution,
marked by an oval of dark stones. The Beauchamp Tower stands at the middle of the west side
of the fortress, built in the thirteenth century and used as a prison; there are numerous inscriptions
and devices on the walls made by the prisoners. Here Lady Jane Grey's husband carved in antique
letters "Iane." In the Bell Tower, at the south-western angle, the princess Elizabeth was confined,
and in the present century it was the prison of Sir Francis Burdett, committed for commenting
in print on the proceedings of the House of Commons. The Tower Subway is a tunnel constructed
recently under the Thames from Tower Hill to Tooley Street for passenger traffic. The Duke
of Wellington was constable of the Tower at one time, and its barracks are sometimes occupied
by as many as eight thousand troops. This ancient fortress always has a profound interest for
visitors, and no part of it more than the Water-Gate, leading from the Thames, the noted "Traitor's
Gate," through which have gone so many victims of despotism and tyranny--heroes who have passed

  "On through that gate, through which before
  Went Sydney, Russell, Raleigh, Cranmer, More."

THE LOLLARDS AND LAMBETH.

The Archbishop of Canterbury, the primate of England, who crowns the sovereigns, has his palace
at Lambeth, on the south side of the Thames, opposite Westminster, and its most noted portion
is the Lollards' Tower. The Lollards, named from their low tone of singing at interments, were
a numerous sect exerting great influence in the fourteenth century. The Church persecuted them,
and many suffered death, and their prison was the Lollards' Tower, built in 1435, adjoining
the archiepiscopal palace. This prison is reached by a narrow stairway, and at the entrance
is a small doorway barely sufficient for one person to pass at a time. The palace itself was
built in the days of the Tudors, and the gatehouse of red brick in 1499. The chapel is Early
English, its oldest portion built in the thirteenth century. All the Archbishops of Canterbury
since that time have been consecrated there. There is a great hall and library, and the history
of this famous religious palace is most interesting. At the red brick gatehouse the dole is
distributed by the archbishop, as from time immemorial, to the indigent parishioners. Thirty
poor widows on three days of the week each get a loaf, meat, and two and a half pence, while
soup is also given them and to other poor persons. The archbishops maintain this charity carefully,
and their office is the head of the Anglican Church.

Bow Church, or St. Mary-le-Bow on Cheapside, is one of the best known churches of London. It
is surmounted by one of the most admired of Wren's spires, which is two hundred and twenty-five
feet high. There is a dragon upon the spire nearly nine feet long. It is the sure criterion
of a London Cockney to have been born within sound of "Bow Bells." A church stood here in very
early times, said to have been built upon arches, from which is derived the name of the Ecclesiastical
Court of Arches, the supreme court of the province of Canterbury, a tribunal first held in
Bow Church. Another of Wren's noted churches is St. Bride's, on Fleet Street, remarkable for
its beautiful steeple, originally two hundred and thirty-four feet high. It has been much damaged
by lightning. The east window of St. Bride's is a copy on stained glass of Rubens' painting
of "The Descent from the Cross." This church contains several famous tombs.

WHITEHALL.

We will now take a brief view of Westminster, the region of palaces, and first of all pause
at the most ancient and famous of them, Whitehall, of which only the Banqueting House remains.
This was originally the residence of the Archbishops of York, and here lived Cardinal Wolsey
in great splendor until his downfall, when Henry VIII. took Whitehall for his palace and made
large additions to the buildings, entering it as a residence with his queen, Anne Boleyn. The
sovereigns of England lived in Whitehall for nearly two centuries, and in Charles I.'s reign
it contained the finest picture-gallery in the kingdom. This unhappy king was beheaded in front
of the Banqueting House, being led to the scaffold out of one of the windows. James II. left
Whitehall when he abandoned the kingdom, and accidental fires in the closing years of the seventeenth
century consumed the greater part of the buildings. The Banqueting House, which is one hundred
and eleven feet long and a fine structure of Portland stone, is all that remains, and it is
now used as a royal chapel, where one of the queen's chaplains preaches every Sunday. Rubens'
paintings commemorating King James I. are still on the ceiling.

In the district of Whitehall is also the army headquarters and office of the commander-in-chief,
the Duke of Cambridge--now known popularly as the "Horse Guards," because in front of it two
mounted horsemen stand on duty all day in horse-boxes on either side of the entrance. The clock
surmounting the building in its central tower is said to be the standard timekeeper of London
for the West End. A carriage-way leads through the centre of the building to St. James Park,
a route which only the royal family are permitted to use. Not far away are the other government
offices--the Admiralty Building and also "Downing Street," where resides the premier and where
the secretaries of state have their offices and the Cabinet meets. Here are the Treasury Building
and the Foreign Office, and from this spot England may be said to be ruled. In this neighborhood
also is Scotland Yard, the headquarters of the London Metropolitan Police, where the chief
commissioner sits and where lost articles are restored to their owners when found in cabs or
omnibuses--an important branch of police duty. It obtained its name from being the residence
of the Scottish kings when they visited London.

ST. JAMES PALACE.

When the palace in Whitehall was destroyed the sovereigns made their residence chiefly at St.
James Palace, which stands on the north side of St. James Park. This building is more remarkable
for its historical associations than for its architecture. It was originally a leper's hospital,
but Henry VIII., obtaining possession of it, pulled down the old buildings and laid out an
extensive park, using it as a semi-rural residence called the Manor House. Its gatehouse and
turrets were built for him from plans by Holbein. Queen Mary died in it, and in its chapel
Charles I. attended service on the morning of his execution, and we are told that he walked
from the palace through the park, guarded by a regiment of troops, to Whitehall to be beheaded.
Here lived General Monk when he planned the Restoration, and William III. first received the
allegiance of the English nobles here in 1688, but it was not used regularly for state ceremonies
until Whitehall was burned. From this official use of St. James Palace comes the title of "The
Court of St. James." Queen Anne, the four Georges, and William III. resided in the palace,
and in its chapel Queen Victoria was married, but she only holds court drawing-rooms and levees
there, using Buckingham Palace for her residence. Passing through the gateway into the quadrangle,
the visitor enters the Color Court, so called from the colors of the household regiment on
duty being placed there. The state apartments are on the south front. The great sight of St.
James is the queen's drawing-room in the height of the season, when presentations are made
at court. On such occasions the "Yeomen of the Guard," a body instituted by Henry VII., line
the chamber, and the "Gentlemen-at-Arms," instituted by Henry VIII., are also on duty, wearing
a uniform of scarlet and gold and carrying small battle-axes covered with crimson velvet. Each
body has a captain, who is a nobleman, these offices being highly prized and usually changed
with the ministry.

BUCKINGHAM PALACE.

We have been to the queen's country-home at Windsor, and will now visit her town-house, Buckingham
Palace, which is also in St. James Park. Here stood a plain brick mansion, built in 1703 by
the Duke of Buckingham, and in which was gathered the famous library of George III., which
is now in the British Museum. The house was described as "dull, dowdy, and decent," but in
1825 it was greatly enlarged and improved, and Queen Victoria took possession of the new palace
in 1837, and has lived there ever since. Her increasing family necessitated the construction
of a large addition in 1846, and a few years afterwards the Marble Arch, which till then formed
the entrance, was moved from Buckingham Palace to Hyde Park, and a fine ball-room constructed
instead. This palace contains a gorgeously-decorated throne-room and a fine picture-gallery,
the grand staircase leading up to the state-apartments being of marble. The gardens of Buckingham
Palace cover about forty acres: in them are a pavilion and an attractive chapel, the latter
having been formerly a conservatory. At the rear of the palace, concealed from view by a high
mound, are the queen's stables or mews, so called because the royal stables were formerly built
in a place used for keeping falcons. In these stables is the gaudily-decorated state coach,
built in 1762 at a cost of $38,000. Marlborough House, the town-residence of the Prince of
Wales, adjoins St. James Palace, but is not very attractive. It was originally built for the
first Duke of Marlborough, who died in it, and is said to have been designed by Wren, having
afterwards been enlarged when it became a royal residence.

KENSINGTON PALACE.

Standing on the west side of the Kensington Gardens is the plain, irregular red brick structure
known as Kensington Palace, which was originally Lord Chancellor Finch's house. William III
bought it from his grandson, and greatly enlarged it. Here died William and Mary, Queen Anne,
and George II., and here Victoria was born. Perhaps the most interesting recent event that
Kensington Palace has witnessed was the notification to this princess of the death of William
IV. Being admitted, they were kept waiting in the courtyard, and then, seeming to be forgotten
by everybody, they turned into a lower room and again rang and pounded. Servants appearing,
they desired that an attendant might be sent to inform the princess that they requested an
audience on business of importance. Then there was more delay, and another ringing to learn
the cause, which ultimately brought the attendant, who stated that the princess was in such
a sweet sleep she could not venture to disturb her. Thoroughly vexed, they said, "We are come
to the queen on business of state, and even her sleep must give way to that." This produced
a speedy result, for, to prove that it was not she who kept them waiting, Victoria in a few
minutes came into the room in a loose white nightgown and shawl, with her hair falling upon
her shoulders and her feet in slippers, shedding tears, but perfectly collected. She immediately
summoned her council at Kensington Palace, but most of the summonses were not received by those
to whom they were sent till after the early hour fixed for the meeting. She sat at the head
of the table, and, as a lady who was then at court writes, "she received first the homage of
the Duke of Cumberland, who was not King of Hanover when he knelt to her; the Duke of Sussex
rose to perform the same ceremony, but the queen with admirable grace stood up, and, preventing
him from kneeling, kissed him on the forehead. The crowd was so great, the arrangements were
so ill made, that my brothers told me the scene of swearing allegiance to their young sovereign
was more like that of the bidding at an auction than anything else."

THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.

The finest of all the public buildings of the British government in London, the Houses of Parliament,
are on the bank of the Thames in Westminster, and are of modern construction. The old Parliament
Houses were burnt nearly fifty years ago, and Sir Charles Barry designed the present magnificent
palace, which covers nearly eight acres and cost $20,000,000. The architecture is in the Tudor
style, and the grand façade stretches nine hundred and forty feet along a terrace fronting
on the Thames. It is richly decorated with statues of kings and queens and heraldic devices,
and has two pinnacled towers at each end and two in the centre. At the northern end one of
the finest bridges across the Thames--the Westminster Bridge--is built, and here rises the
Clock Tower, forty feet square and three hundred and twenty feet high, copied in great measure
from a similar tower at Bruges. A splendid clock and bells are in the tower, the largest bell,
which strikes the hours, weighing eight tons and the clock-dials being thirty feet in diameter.
The grandest feature of this palace, however, is the Victoria Tower, at the south-western angle,
eighty feet square and three hundred and forty feet high. Here is the sovereign's entrance
to the House of Peers, through a magnificent archway sixty-five feet high and having inside
the porch statues of the patron saints of the three kingdoms--St. George, St. Andrew, and St.
Patrick--and one of Queen Victoria, between the figures of Justice and Mercy. From the centre
of the palace rises a spire over the dome of the Central Hall three hundred feet high. In constructing
the palace the old Westminster Hall has been retained, so that it forms a grand public entrance,
leading through St. Stephen's Porch to St. Stephen's Hall, which is ninety-five feet long and
fifty-six feet high, where statues have been placed of many of the great statesmen and judges
of England. From this a passage leads to the Central Hall, an octagonal chamber seventy feet
across and seventy-five feet high, with a beautiful groined roof. Corridors adorned with frescoes
stretch north and south from this Central Hall to the House of Commons and the House of Peers.
The former is sixty-two feet long, and constructed with especial attention to acoustics, but
it only has seats for a little over two-thirds of the membership of the House, and the others
must manage as they can. The Speaker's chair is at the north end, and the ministers sit on
his right hand and the opposition on the left. Outside the House are the lobbies, where the
members go on a division. The interior of the House is plain, excepting the ceiling, which
is richly decorated. The House of Peers is most gorgeously ornamented, having on either side
six lofty stained-glass windows with portraits of sovereigns, these windows being lighted at
night from the outside. The room is ninety-one feet long, and at each end has three frescoed
archways representing religious and allegorical subjects. Niches in the walls contain statues
of the barons who compelled King John to sign Magna Charta. There are heraldic devices on the
ceilings and walls, and the throne stands at the southern end. The "Woolsack," where sits the
lord chancellor, who presides over the House, is a seat near the middle of the room, covered
with crimson cloth. When the sovereign comes to the palace and enters the gateway at the Victoria
Tower, she is ushered into the Norman Porch, containing statues and frescoes representing the
Norman sovereigns, and then enters the Robing Room, splendidly decorated and having frescoes
representing the legends of King Arthur. When the ceremony of robing is completed, she proceeds
to the House of Peers through the longest room in the palace, the Victoria Gallery, one hundred
and ten feet long and forty-five feet wide and high. Historical frescoes adorn the walls and
the ceiling is richly gilded. This gallery leads to the Prince's Chamber, also splendidly decorated,
and having two doorways opening into the House of Peers, one on each side of the throne. In
this palace for six months in every year the British Parliament meets.

HYDE PARK.

When the Marble Arch was taken from Buckingham Palace, it was removed to Hyde Park, of which
it forms one of the chief entrances at Cumberland Gate. This magnificent gate, which cost $400,000,
leads into probably the best known of the London parks, the ancient manor of Hyde. It was an
early resort of fashion, for the Puritans in their time complained of it as the resort of "most
shameful powdered-hair men and painted women." It covers about three hundred and ninety acres,
and has a pretty sheet of water called the Serpentine. The fashionable drive is on the southern
side, and here also is the famous road for equestrians known as Rotten Row, which stretches
nearly a mile and a half. On a fine afternoon in the season the display on these roads is grand.
In Hyde Park are held the great military reviews and the mass-meetings of the populace, who
occasionally display their discontent by battering down the railings. At Hyde Park Corner is
a fine entrance-gate, with the Green Park Gate opposite, surmounted by the Wellington bronze
equestrian statue. The most magnificent decoration of Hyde Park is the Albert Memorial, situated
near the Prince's Gate on the southern side. The upper portion is a cross, supported by three
successive tiers of emblematic gilt figures, and at the four angles are noble groups representing
the four quarters of the globe. This was the masterpiece of Sir Gilbert Scott, and is considered
the most splendid monument of modern times. It marks the site of the Crystal Palace Exhibition
of 1851, in which Prince Albert took great interest: there are upon it one hundred and sixty-nine
life-size portrait figures of illustrious artists, composers, and poets, while under the grand
canopy in the centre is the seated figure of the prince. Opposite is the Royal Albert Hall,
and behind this the magnificent buildings of the South Kensington Museum, which grew out of
the Exhibition of 1851, and the site for which was bought with the surplus fund of that great
display. This is a national museum for art and manufactures allied to art. Its collections
are becoming enormous and of priceless value, and include many fine paintings, among them Raphael's
cartoons, with galleries of sculpture and antiquities and museums of patent models. There are
art-schools and libraries, and the buildings, which have been constructing for several years,
are of rare architectural merit. The Royal Albert Hall is a vast amphitheatre of great magnificence
devoted to exhibitions of industry, art, and music. It is of oval form, and its external frieze
and cornice are modelled after the Elgin Marbles. Opposite it are the gardens of the Horticultural
Society.

A VIEW IN THE POULTRY.

Going down into the heart of the old city of London, and standing in the street called the
Poultry, the Bank of England and the Royal Exchange are seen over on the other side, with Threadneedle
Street between them, and Lombard Street on the right hand, the region that controls the monetary
affairs of the world. Turning round, the Mansion House is behind the observer, this being the
lord mayor's residence and the head-quarters of the city government. The Royal Exchange has
been thrice built and twice burned--first in the great fire of 1666, and afterwards in 1838.
The present Exchange, costing $900,000, was opened in 1844, and is three hundred and eight
feet long, with a fine portico on the western front ninety-six feet wide, and supported by
twelve columns, each forty-one feet high. Within is an open area surrounded by an arcade, while
at the rear is Lloyds, the underwriters' offices, where the business of insuring ships is transacted
in a hall ninety-eight feet long and forty feet wide. Wellington's statue stands in front of
the Exchange, and in the middle of the central area is a statue of Queen Victoria. The Bank
of England, otherwise known as the "Old Lady of Threadneedle Street," covers a quadrangular
space of about four acres, with a street on each side. It is but one story high, and has no
windows on the outside, the architecture being unattractive. The interior is well adapted for
the bank offices, which are constructed around nine courts. The bank has been built in bits,
and gradually assumed its present size and appearance. It was founded in 1691 by William Paterson,
but it did not remove to its present site until 1734. Its affairs are controlled by a governor,
deputy governor, and twenty-four directors, and the bank shares of $500 par, paying about ten
per cent. dividends per annum, sell at about $1400. It regulates the discount rate, gauging
it so as to maintain its gold reserves, and it also keeps the coinage in good order by weighing
every coin that passes through the bank, and casting out the light ones by an ingenious machine
that will test thirty-five thousand in a day. It also prints its own notes upon paper containing
its own water-mark, which is the chief reliance against forgery. The bank transacts the government
business in connection with the British public debt of about $3,850,000,000, all in registered
stock, and requiring two hundred and fifty thousand separate accounts to be kept. Its deposits
aggregate at least $130,000,000, and its capital is $72,765,000. The bank is the great British
storehouse for gold, keeping on deposit the reserves of the joint-stock banks and the private
bankers of London, and it will have in its vaults at one time eighty to one hundred millions
of dollars in gold in ingots, bullion, or coin, this being the basis on which the entire banking
system of England is conducted. It keeps an accurate history of every bank-note that is issued,
redeeming each note that comes back into the bank in the course of business, and keeping all
the redeemed and cancelled notes. The earliest notes were written with a pen, and from this
they have been improved until they have become the almost square white pieces of paper of to-day,
printed in bold German text, that are so well known, yet are unlike any other bank-notes in
existence. Around the large elliptical table in the bank parlor the directors meet every Thursday
to regulate its affairs, and--not forgetting they are true Englishmen--eat a savory dinner,
the windows of the parlor looking out upon a little gem of a garden in the very heart of London.
The Mansion House, built in 1740, is fronted by a Corinthian portico, with six fluted columns
and a pediment of allegorical sculpture. Within is the Egyptian Hall, where the lord mayor
fulfils what is generally regarded as his chief duty, the giving of grand banquets. He can
invite four hundred persons to the tables in this spacious hall, which is ornamented by several
statues by British sculptors, over $40,000 having been expended for its ornamentation. The
lord mayor also has a ball-room and other apartments, including his Venetian parlor and the
justice room where he sits as a magistrate. From the open space in front of the Mansion House
diverge streets running to all parts of London and the great bridges over the Thames.

THE INNS OF COURT.

The four Inns of Court in London have been described as the palladiums of English liberty--the
Inner Temple, Middle Temple, Lincoln's Inn, and Gray's Inn. There are over three thousand barristers
members of these Inns, and the best known is probably Lincoln's Inn, which is named after De
Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, who died in 1312, and had his house on its site, his device, the lion
rampant, being adopted by the Inn. The ancient gatehouse, which opens from Chancery Lane, is
nearly four hundred years old. The Inn has an old hall dating from 1506, and also a fine modern
hall, the Newcastle House, one hundred and twenty feet long, built in Tudor style, with stained-glass
windows and having life-size figures of several eminent members in canopied niches. Here is
Hogarth's celebrated picture of "Paul before Felix." The Inn has a valuable library, and among
its members has counted More, Hale, Selden, Mansfield, and Hardwicke.

Across Fleet Street, and between it and the Thames, is the Temple, a lane dividing it into
the Inner and the Middle Temple, while obstructing Fleet Street there was the old Temple Bar,
one of the ancient city gates, which has recently been removed. The name is derived from the
Knights Templar, who existed here seven centuries ago; and they afterwards gave the site to
certain law-students who wished to live in the suburbs away from the noise of the city. Here
in seclusion, for the gates were locked at night, the gentlemen of these societies in a bygone
age were famous for the masques and revels given in their halls. Kings and judges attended
them, and many were the plays and songs and dances that then enlivened the dull routine of
the law. The Inner Temple has for its device a winged horse, and the Middle Temple a lamb.

Here is the old Templar Church of St. Mary, built in 1185 and enlarged in 1240. Formerly, the
lawyers waited for their clients in this ancient church. During recent years England has erected
magnificent buildings for her law courts. The new Palace of Justice fronts about five hundred
feet on the Strand, near the site of Temple Bar, which was taken away because it impeded the
erection of the new courts, and they cover six acres, with ample gardens back from the street,
the wings extending about five hundred feet northward around them. A fine clock-tower surmounts
the new courts. In this part of the Strand are many ancient structures, above which the Palace
of Justice grandly towers, and some of them have quaint balconies overlooking the street.

While in old London the feasting that has had so much to do with the municipal corporation
cannot be forgotten, and on Bishopsgate Street we find the scene of many of the famous public
dinners, savory with turtle-soup and whitebait--the London Tavern. Not far distant, and on
the same street, is Sir Paul Pindar's House, a quaint structure, now falling into decay, that
gives an excellent idea of mediæval domestic architecture.

THE BRITISH MUSEUM.

Fronting upon Great Russell Street, to which various smaller streets lead northward from Oxford
Street, is that vast treasure-house of knowledge whose renown is world-wide, the British Museum.
The buildings and their courtyards cover seven acres, and have cost nearly $5,000,000 to construct.
The front is three hundred and seventy feet long, the entrance being under a grand portico
supported by rows of columns forty-five feet high. This vast museum originated from a provision
in the will of Sir Hans Sloane in the last century, who had made a valuable collection and
directed that it be sold to the government for $100,000. Parliament, accepting the offer, in
1753 created the museum to take charge of this and some other collections. The present site,
then Montagu House, was selected for the museum, but it was not until 1828 that the present
buildings were begun, and they have only recently been finished. The reading-room, the latest
addition, is the finest structure of its kind in the world, being a circular hall one hundred
and forty feet in diameter and covered with a dome one hundred and six feet high. It cost $750,000,
and its library is believed to be the largest in the world, containing seven hundred thousand
volumes, and increasing at the rate of twenty thousand volumes annually. Its collection of
prints is also of rare value and vast extent, and by far the finest in the world.

SOME LONDON SCENES.

Let us now take a brief glance at some well-known London sights. The two great heroes who are
commemorated in modern London are Wellington and Nelson. Trafalgar Square commemorates Nelson's
death and greatest victory, the Nelson Column standing in the centre, with Landseer's colossal
lions reposing at its base. Passing eastward along the Strand, beyond Charing Cross and Somerset
House, we come to Wellington Street, which leads to Waterloo Bridge across the Thames. This
admirable structure, the masterpiece of John Rennie, cost $5,000,000, and was opened on the
anniversary of the battle of Waterloo in 1817. It is of granite, and with the approaches nearly
a half mile long, crossing the river upon nine arches, each of one hundred and twenty feet
span. Passing westward from Trafalgar Square, we enter Pall Mall, perhaps the most striking
of the London streets in point of architecture. Here are club-houses and theatres, statues
and columns, and the street swarms with historical associations. On the south side are the
Reform and Carlton Clubs, the headquarters respectively of the Liberal and Conservative parties,
and a little beyond, on the same side, the row of buildings of all sizes and shapes making
up the War Office. Among them is a quaint old Queen-Anne mansion of brick, with a curious pediment
and having many windows. This is Schomberg House, shorn of one wing, but still retained among
so much that is grand around it. Also in Pall Mall is Foley's celebrated statue of Sidney Herbert,
one of the most impressive in London--the head drooped sadly and reflectively, indicating that
it is the image of a conscientious war-minister, who, overweighted with the responsibility
of his office, was cut off prematurely. Although not one of the greatest men of England, Herbert's
fame will be better preserved by his finer statue than that of many men who have filled a much
larger space in her history. Marlborough House has an entrance on Pall Mall, and adjoining
its gate is the curious and elaborately decorated building of the Beaconsfield Club. Over the
doorway the semicircular cornice does duty for a balcony for the drawing-room windows above.
The doorway itself is an imposing archway strangely cut into segments, one forming a window
and the other the door.

London contains in the West End many squares surrounded by handsome residences, among them
probably the best known being Belgrave, Russell, Bedford, Grosvenor, Hanover, and Cavendish
Squares. Eaton Square is said to be the largest of these, Grosvenor Square the most fashionable,
and Cavendish Square the most salubrious and best cultivated. The line of streets leading by
Oxford Street to the Marble Arch entrance to Hyde Park is London's most fashionable route of
city travel, and on Tottenham Court Road, which starts northward from Oxford Street, is the
"Bell Inn" at Edmonton. It is not a very attractive house, but is interesting because it was
here that Johnny Gilpin and his worthy spouse should have dined when that day of sad disasters
came which Cowper has chronicled in John Gilpin's famous ride. The old house has been much
changed since then, and is shorn of its balcony, but it has capacious gardens, and is the resort
to this day of London holiday-makers. It is commonly known as "Gilpin's Bell," and a painting
of the ride is proudly placed outside the inn. Tottenham Court Road goes through Camden Town,
and here at Euston Square is the London terminus of the greatest railway in England--the London
and North-western Company. Large hotels adjoin the station, and the Underground Railway comes
into it alongside the platform, thus giving easy access to all parts of the metropolis. This
railway is one of the wonders of the metropolis, and it has cost about $3,250,000 per mile
to construct. The original idea seems to have been to connect the various stations of the railways
leading out of town, and to do this, and at the same time furnish means of rapid transit from
the heart of the city to the suburbs, the railway has been constructed in the form of an irregular
ellipse, running all around the city, yet kept far within the built-up portions. It is a double
track, with trains running all around both ways, so that the passenger goes wherever he wishes
simply by following the circuit, while branch lines extend to the West End beyond Paddington
and Kensington. It is constructed not in a continuous tunnel, for there are frequent open spaces,
but on a general level lower than that of the greater part of London, and the routes are pursued
without regard to the street-lines on the surface above, often passing diagonally under blocks
of houses. The construction has taxed engineering skill to the utmost, for huge buildings have
had to be shored up, sewers diverted, and, at the stations, vast spaces burrowed underground
to get enough room. In this way London has solved its rapid-transit problem, though it could
be done only at enormous cost. The metropolis, it will be seen, has no end of attractions,
and for the traveller's accommodation the ancient inns are rapidly giving place to modern hotels.
Among London's famous hostelries is the "Old Tabard Inn" in the Borough, which will probably
soon be swept away.

HOLLAND HOUSE.

To describe London, as we said before, would fill a volume, but space forbids lingering longer,
and we will pass out of the metropolis, after devoting brief attention to one of its historical
mansions, the well-known Holland House. This fine old building of the time of James I. stands
upon high ground in the western suburbs of London, and its history is interwoven with several
generations of arts, politics, and literature. The house is of red brick, embellished with
turrets, gable-ends, and mullioned windows. As its park has already been partly cut up for
building-lots, the end of the celebrated mansion itself is believed to be not far off. Built
in 1607, it descended to the first Earl of Holland, whence its name. Surviving the Civil Wars,
when Fairfax used it for his head-quarters, it is noted that plays were privately performed
here in Cromwell's time. In 1716, Addison married the dowager Countess of Holland and Warwick,
and the estate passed to him, and he died at Holland House in 1719, having addressed to his
stepson, the dissolute Earl of Warwick, the solemn words, "I have sent for you that you may
see how a Christian can die." Two years later the young earl himself died. In 1762 the estate
was sold to Henry Vassall Fox, Baron Holland, the famous Whig, who died there in 1774. It is
related that during his last illness George Selwyn called and left his card. Selwyn had a fondness
for seeing dead bodies, and the dying lord remarked, "If Mr. Selwyn calls again, show him up:
if I am alive I shall be delighted to see him, and if I am dead he would like to see me." He
composed his own epitaph: "Here lies Henry Vassall Fox, Lord Holland, etc., who was drowned
while sitting in his elbow-chair." He died in his elbow-chair, of water in the chest. Charles
James Fox was his second son, and passed his early years at Holland House. Near the mansion,
on the Kensington Road, was the Adam and Eve Inn, where it is said that Sheridan, on his way
to and from Holland House, regularly stopped for a dram, and thus ran up a long bill, which
Lord Holland ultimately paid.

The house, built like half the letter H, is of red brick with stone finishings, and in the
Elizabethan style, with Dutch gardens of a later date. Much of the old-time decorations and
furniture remains. The library, a long gallery, forms the eastern wing, and contains a valuable
collection, including many manuscripts and autographs. There are fine pictures and sculptures,
with old clocks, vases, cabinets, and carvings, and also a celebrated collection of miniatures.
After Vassall's death his nephew maintained the reputation of Holland House, dying in 1840,
when the estates descended to his only son, the late Lord Holland, who also kept up the character
of the mansion. But now, however, the glory of the famous old house is slowly departing, and
has chiefly become a fragrant memory.

Eastward from London is the great park which the queen in May opened with much pomp as a breathing-ground
for the masses of that densely-populated region, the east end of the metropolis--Epping Forest.
This beautiful enclosure originally consisted of nine thousand acres, but encroachments reduced
it to about one-third that size. Reclamations were made, however, and the park now opened covers
five thousand six hundred acres--a magnificent pleasure-ground.

GREENWICH.

The river Thames, steadily gathering force after sweeping through London past the docks, and
receiving upon its capacious bosom the vast commerce of all the world, encircles the Isle of
Dogs (where Henry VIII. kept his hounds) below the city, and at the southern extremity of the
reach we come to Greenwich. Here go many holiday-parties to the famous inns, where they get
the Greenwich fish-dinners and can look back at the great city they have left. Here the ministry
at the close of the session has its annual whitebait dinner. Greenwich was the Roman Grenovicum
and the Saxon Green Town. Here encamped the Danes when they overran England in the eleventh
century, and their fleet was anchored in the Thames. It became a royal residence in Edward
I.'s time, and Henry IV. dated his will at the manor of Greenwich. In 1437, Greenwich Castle
was built within a park, and its tower is now used for the Observatory. Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester,
then held Greenwich, and was the regent of England during Henry VI.'s minority. He was assassinated
by rivals in 1447, and the manor reverted to the Crown. The palace was enlarged and embellished,
and Henry VIII. was born there in 1491. He greatly improved the palace, and made it his favorite
residence, Queen Elizabeth being born there in 1533. King Edward VI. died at Greenwich in 1553,
and Elizabeth, enlarging the palace, kept a regular court there. It was her favorite summer
home, and the chronicler of the time, writing of a visit to the place, says, in describing
the ceremonial of Elizabeth's court, that the presence-chamber was hung with rich tapestry,
and the floor, after the then fashion, was covered with rushes. At the door stood a gentleman
in velvet with a gold chain, who introduced persons of distinction who came to wait upon the
queen. A large number of high officials waited for the queen to appear on her way to chapel.
Ultimately she came out, attended by a gorgeous escort. She is described as sixty-five years
old, very majestic, with an oblong face, fair but wrinkled, small black, pleasant eyes, nose
a little hooked, narrow lips, and black teeth (caused by eating too much sugar). She wore false
red hair, and had a small crown on her head and rich pearl drops in her ears, with a necklace
of fine jewels falling upon her uncovered bosom. Her air was stately, and her manner of speech
mild and obliging. She wore a white silk dress bordered with large pearls, and over it was
a black silk mantle embroidered with silver thread. Her long train was borne by a marchioness.
She spoke graciously to those whom she passed, occasionally giving her right hand to a favored
one to kiss. Whenever she turned her face in going along everybody fell on their knees. The
ladies of the court following her were mostly dressed in white. Reaching the ante-chapel, petitions
were presented her, she receiving them graciously, which caused cries of "Long live Queen Elizabeth!"
She answered, "I thank you, my good people," and then went into the service.

King James I. put a new front in the palace, and his queen laid the foundation of the "House
of Delight," which is now the central building of the Naval Asylum. King Charles I. resided
much at Greenwich, and finished the "House of Delight," which was the most magnificently furnished
mansion then in England. King Charles II., finding the palace decayed, for it had fallen into
neglect during the Civil Wars, had it taken down, and began the erection of a new palace, built
of freestone. In the time of William and Mary it became the Royal Naval Asylum, the magnificent
group of buildings now there being extensions of Charles II.'s palace, while behind rises the
Observatory, and beyond is the foliage of the park. The asylum was opened in 1705, and consists
of quadrangular buildings enclosing a square. In the south-western building is the Painted
Hall, adorned with portraits of British naval heroes and pictures of naval victories. The asylum
supports about two thousand seven hundred in-pensioners and six thousand out-pensioners, while
it has a school with eight hundred scholars. By a recent change the in-pensioners are permitted
to reside where they please, and it has lately been converted into a medical hospital for wounded
seamen. Its income is about $750,000 yearly. The Greenwich Observatory, besides being the centre
whence longitude is reckoned, is also charged with the regulation of time throughout the kingdom.

The Thames, which at London Bridge is eight hundred feet wide, becomes one thousand feet wide
at Greenwich, and then it pursues its crooked course between uninteresting shores past Woolwich
dockyard, where it is a quarter of a mile wide, and on to Gravesend, where the width is half
a mile; then it broadens into an estuary which is eighteen miles wide at the mouth. Almost
the only thing that relieves the dull prospect along the lower Thames is Shooter's Hill, behind
Woolwich, which rises four hundred and twelve feet. Gravesend, twenty-six miles below London
Bridge by the river, is the outer boundary of the port of London, and is the head-quarters
of the Royal Thames Yacht Club. Its long piers are the first landing-place of foreign vessels.
Gravesend is the head-quarters for shrimps, its fishermen taking them in vast numbers and London
consuming a prodigious quantity. This fishing and custom-house town, for it is a combination
of both, has its streets filled with "tea-and shrimp-houses."

TILBURY FORT.

On the opposite bank of the Thames is Tilbury Fort, the noted fortress that commands the navigation
of the river and protects the entrance to London. It dates from Charles II.'s time, fright
from De Ruyter's Dutch incursion up the Thames in 1667 having led the government to convert
Henry VIII.'s blockhouse that stood there into a strong fortification. It was to Tilbury that
Queen Elizabeth went when she defied the Spanish Armada. Leicester put a bridge of boats across
the river to obstruct the passage, and gathered an army of eighteen thousand men on shore.
Here the queen made her bold speech of defiance, in which she said she knew she had the body
of but a weak and feeble woman, but she also had the heart and stomach of a king, and rather
than her realm should be invaded and dishonor grow by her, she herself would take up arms.
She had then, all told, one hundred and thirty thousand soldiers and one hundred and eighty-one
war-vessels, but the elements conquered the "Invincible Armada," barely one-third of it getting
back to Spain.

Thus we have traced England's famous river from its source in the Cotswolds until it falls
into the North Sea at the mouth of the broad estuary beyond Sheerness and the Nore.

ST. ALBANS.

The railway running from London to Edinburgh, and on which the celebrated fast train the "Flying
Scotchman" travels between the two capitals, is the longest in Britain. Its route northward
from the metropolis to the Scottish border, with occasional digressions, will furnish many
places of interest. On the outskirts of London, in the north-western suburbs, is the well-known
school founded three hundred years ago by John Lyon at Harrow, standing on a hill two hundred
feet high. One of the most interesting towns north of London, for its historical associations
and antiquarian remains, is St. Albans in Hertfordshire. Here, on the opposite slopes of a
shelving valley, are seen on the one hand the town that has clustered around the ancient abbey
of St. Albans, and on the other the ruins of the fortification of Verulam, both relics of Roman
power and magnificence. On this spot stood the chief town of the Cassii, whose king, Cassivelaunus,
vainly opposed the inroads of Cæsar. Here the victorious Roman, after crossing the Thames,
besieged and finally overthrew the Britons. The traces of the ancient earthworks are still
plainly seen on the banks of the little river Ver, and when the Romans got possession there
arose the flourishing town of Verulam, which existed until the British warrior-queen. Boadicea,
stung by the oppressions of her race, stormed and captured the place and ruthlessly massacred
its people. But her triumph was short lived, for the Romans, gaining reinforcements, recaptured
the city. This was in the earlier days of the Christian era, and at a time when Christian persecutions
raged. There then lived in Verulam a prominent man named Alban, a young Roman of good family.
In the year 303 a persecuted priest named Amphibalus threw himself upon the mercy of Alban,
and sought refuge in his house. The protection was granted, and in a few days the exhortations
of Amphibalus had converted his protector to Christianity. The officials, getting word of Amphibalus'
whereabouts, sent a guard to arrest him, whereupon Alban dismissed his guest secretly, and,
wrapping himself in the priest's robe and hood, awaited the soldiers. They seized him, and
took him before the magistrates, when the trick was discovered. He was given the alternative
of dying or sacrificing to the gods of Rome, but, preferring the crown of martyrdom, after
cruel torments he was led to his doom. He was to be taken across the Ver to be beheaded, but
miracles appeared. The stream, which had been a-flood, quickly dried up, so that the multitude
could pass, and this so touched the executioner that he refused to strike the blow and declared
himself also a convert. The executioner's head was quickly stricken off, and another headsman
obtained. Alban meanwhile was athirst, and at his prayer a spring broke from the ground for
his refreshment. The new executioner struck off Alban's head, but in doing so his eyes dropped
from their sockets. On the spot where Alban died the abbey was afterwards built. His martyrdom
did not save Amphibalus, who was soon captured and put to death at Redburn, a few miles away,
where his relics were afterwards discovered and enshrined, like those of his pupil, in the abbey.

The sacrifice of the protomartyr brought its fruits. Verulam became Christian, and within a
century was paying him the honors of a saint. In the eighth century King Offa of Mercia, having
treacherously murdered King Ethelbert, became conscience-stricken, and to propitiate Heaven
founded the abbey. He built a Benedictine monastery, which was richly endowed, and gradually
attracted the town away from Verulam and over to its present site. This monastery existed until
the Norman Conquest, when it was rebuilt, the ruins of Verulam serving as a quarry. Thus began
the great abbey of St. Albans, which still overlooks the Ver, although it has been materially
altered since. It prospered greatly, and the close neighborhood to London brought many pilgrims
as well as royal visits. The abbots were invested with great powers and became dictatorial
and proud, having frequent contests with the townsfolk; and it is recorded that one young man
who applied for admission to the order, being refused on account of his ignorance, went abroad
and ultimately became Pope Adrian IV. But he bore the abbot no ill-will, afterwards granting
it many favors. Cardinal Wolsey was once the abbot, but did not actively govern it. In 1539
its downfall came, and it surrendered to King Henry VIII. The deed of surrender, signed by
thirty-nine monks, is still preserved, and the seal is in the British Museum. The abbey is
now in ruins; the church and gateway remain, but the great group of buildings that composed
it has mostly disappeared, so that the old monastery is almost as completely effaced as Verulam.
But the church, by being bought for $2000 for the St. Albans parish church, is still preserved,
and is one of the most interesting ecclesiastical structures in England; yet its great length
and massive central tower are rather unfavorable to its picturesqueness, though the tower when
seen from a distance impresses by its grandeur and simplicity. In this tower, as well as in
other parts of the church, can be detected the ancient bricks from Verulam. The ground-plan
of St. Albans Church is a Latin cross, and it is five hundred and forty-eight feet long. The
western part was erected in the twelfth, and the greater portion of the nave and choir in the
thirteenth century. The floor of the choir is almost paved with sepulchral slabs, though of
the two hundred monuments the church once contained barely a dozen remain. At the back of the
high altar was the great treasury of the abbey, the shrine enclosing St. Alban's relics, but
this was destroyed at the Reformation: some fragments have been since discovered, and the shrine
thus reproduced with tolerable completeness. On the side of the chapel is a wooden gallery,
with cupboards beneath and a staircase leading up to it. In the shrine and cupboards were the
abbey treasures, and in the gallery the monks kept watch at night lest they should be despoiled.
This vigilance, we are told, was necessary, for rival abbeys were by no means scrupulous about
the means by which they augmented their stores of relics. This quaint gallery, still preserved,
is five hundred years old. Near the shrine is the tomb of Duke Humphrey of Gloucester, brother
of King Henry V. and regent during the minority of Henry VI., who was assassinated at Windsor.
The tomb was opened in 1703, and the skeleton found buried among spices and enclosed in two
coffins, the outer of lead. The vault remained opened, and visitors purloined good Humphrey's
bones till nearly all had disappeared, when the authorities concluded it was better to close
up the vault and save what remained. The massive gatehouse, which still exists, was built in
Richard II.'s reign, and was used for a jail until not long ago they determined to put a school
there. In front of it the martyr Tankerfield was burnt, and buried in 1555 in a little triangular
graveyard which still exists. Fox, in his Book of Martyrs, relates that he endured the pain
with great constancy, and testified to the last against the errors of his persecutors.

In the town of St. Albans, near the abbey and at the junction of two streets, stands the ancient
clock-tower, built in the early part of the fifteenth century, and mainly of flint. It occupies
the site of an earlier one said to have been erected by two ladies of Verulam, who, wandering
alone in the woods and becoming lost, saw a light in a house, sought refuge there, and erected
the tower on the site as a memorial of their deliverance. The bell in this tower was in former
days used to ring the curfew. The town itself has little to show. In the church of St. Peter,
among the monumental brasses, is the one to a priest often quoted, that reads:

  "Lo, all that here I spent, that some time had I;
  All that I gave in good intent, that now have I;
  That I neither gave nor lent, that now abie[A] I;
  That I kept till I went, that lost I."

Edward Strong, the mason who built St. Paul's Cathedral in London under the direction of Wren,
is also buried in this church. Its chief tenants, however, are the slain at the second battle
of St. Albans in the Wars of the Roses. At the first of these battles, fought in 1455 on the
east side of the town, Henry of Lancaster was wounded and captured by the Duke of York. The
second battle, a much more important contest, was fought on Shrove Tuesday, February 17, 1461,
at Barnard's Heath, north of the town, and near St. Peter's Church. Queen Margaret of Lancaster
led her forces in person, and was victorious over the Yorkists under the Earl of Warwick, liberating
the captive king, who was in the enemy's camp, and following the battle by a ruthless execution
of prisoners. King Henry, who had gone to St. Alban's shrine in tribulation when captured in
the earlier contest, also went there again in thanksgiving when thus liberated six years later.
The town of St. Albans, by the growth of time, has stretched across the Ver, and one straggling
suburb reaches into the north-western angle of the ruins of ancient Verulam, where it clusters
around the little church of St. Michael within the Roman city. This is a plain church, built
in patches, parts of it nearly a thousand years old, and is the burial place of Francis Bacon,
who was Baron of Verulam and Viscount St. Albans. Within a niche on the side of the chancel
is his familiar effigy in marble, where he sits in an arm-chair and contemplatively gazes upward.
From these ruins of Verulam is obtained the best view of St. Alban's Abbey, with the town in
the background, overlooked by its clock-tower.

[Footnote A: This word means expiate.]

HATFIELD HOUSE.

A short distance east of St. Albans is Hatfield, and in a fine park in the suburbs stands the
magnificent mansion of the Marquis of Salisbury--Hatfield House. The place is ancient, though
the house is completely modern. The manor was given by King Edgar to the monastery at Ely,
and, as in course of time the abbot became a bishop, the manor afterwards became known as Bishops
Hatfield, a name that it still bears. The oldest portion of the present buildings was erected
in the reign of Henry VII., and in the time of his successor it passed into possession of the
Crown. Here lived young Edward VI., and he was escorted by the Earl of Hertford and a cavalcade
of noblemen from Hatfield to London for his coronation. The youthful king granted Hatfield
to his sister Elizabeth, and here she was kept in Queen Mary's reign after her release from
the Tower. She was under the guardianship of Sir Thomas Pope when, in November, 1558, Queen
Mary died, and Sir William Cecil sent messengers from London to apprise Elizabeth that the
crown awaited her. We are told that when they arrived the princess was found in the park, sitting
under a spreading oak--a noble tree then, but time has since made sad havoc with it, though
the remains are carefully preserved as one of the most precious memorials at Hatfield. The
family of Cecil, thus introduced to Hatfield, was destined to continue associated with its
fortunes. Sir William came to the manor on the next day, and then peers and courtiers of all
ilks flocked thither to worship the rising sun. On the following day the queen gave her first
reception in the hall and received the fealty of the leading men of every party; but she did
not forget Cecil, for her earliest act was to appoint him her chief secretary, lord treasurer,
and adviser--a tie that continued for forty years and was only sundered by death. Cecil was
afterwards made Lord Burghley, and the confidence thus first reposed in him within the hall
that was afterwards to become the home of his descendants was most remarkable. She sometimes
chid him sharply, but he was the man whom she delighted to honor.

But it was not until after his death that Hatfield came into possession of his family. He built
Burghley House near Stamford in Lincolnshire, and left it to his younger son, Sir Robert Cecil.
After Elizabeth's death, King James I. expressed a preference for Burghley over Hatfield, and
an exchange was made by which Hatfield passed into possession of Sir Robert, who had succeeded
his father as chief minister, and, though in weak health and of small stature, was a wise and
faithful servant of the queen and of her successor. In Elizabeth's last illness, when she persisted
in sitting propped up on a stool by pillows, he urged her to rest herself, and inadvertently
said she "must go to bed." The queen fired up. "Must!" cried she. Sir Robert did not survive
the queen many years, and to him King James's peaceful succession to the throne is said to
have been greatly due. The king made him the Earl of Salisbury, and the title descended for
several generations, until, in 1773, the seventh earl was promoted to the rank of marquis,
and now Robert Cecil, the third Marquis of Salisbury and one of the leaders of the Conservative
party, presides over the estates at Hatfield. The chief entrance to Hatfield House is on the
northern side, and above it rises a cupola. The buildings form three sides of an oblong, the
longer line fronting the north and the two wings pointing towards the south. They are of brick,
with stone dressings and facings, and are admired as a faithful example of the excellent domestic
architecture of the early part of the seventeenth century. The approach through the park from
the town is of great beauty, the grand avenue, bordered by stately trees, conducting the visitor
to a court in front of the house enclosed by a balustrade with handsome gates. Within the building
the most remarkable features are the galleries, extending along the entire southern front.
The gallery on the ground floor was formerly a corridor, open on one side to the air; but at
a comparatively recent period this has been enclosed with glass, and thus converted into a
gallery paved with black and white marble, and ornamented with arms and armor, some being trophies
from the Armada and others from the Crimea. Here is the rich saddle-cloth used on the white
steed that Queen Elizabeth rode at Tilbury. There are a fine chapel and attractive state-apartments,
but around the old house there lingers a tale of sorrow. The western wing was burned in 1835,
and the dowager marchioness, the grandmother of the present marquis, then five years old, perished
in the flames, which originated in her chamber. This wing has been finely restored, and the
room in which she was burned contains her portrait, an oval medallion let into the wall over
the fireplace. It is the sweet and sunny face of a young girl, and her tragic fate in helpless
age reminds of Solon's warning as we look at the picture: "Count no one happy till he dies."
In the gallery at Hatfield are portraits of King Henry VIII. and all six of his wives. In the
library, which is rich in historical documents, is the pedigree of Queen Elizabeth, emblazoned
in 1559, and tracing her ancestry in a direct line back to Adam! The state bedrooms have been
occupied by King James, Cromwell, and Queen Victoria. In the gardens, not far from the house,
is the site of the old episcopal palace of Bishops Hatfield, of which one side remains standing,
with the quaint gatehouse now used as an avenue of approach up the hill from the town to the
stables. There is a fine view of the town through the ancient gateway. Here lived the princess
Elizabeth, and in the halls where kings have banqueted the marquis's horses now munch their
oats. Immediately below, in the town, is Salisbury Chapel, in which repose the bones of his
ancestors.

Also in Hertfordshire are Cassiobury, the seat of the Earls of Essex, whose ancestor, Lord
Capel, who was beheaded in 1648 for his loyalty to King Charles I., brought the estate into
the family by his marriage with Elizabeth Morison; and Knebworth, the home of Lord Lytton the
novelist, which has been the home of his ancestors since the time of Henry VII., when it was
bought by Sir Robert Lytton. The "Great Bed of Ware" is one of the curiosities of the county--a
vast bed twelve feet square, originally at the Saracen's Head Inn. It was built for King Edward
IV., and was curiously carved, and has had a distinguished place in English literary allusions.
The bed still exists at Rye House in Hertfordshire, where it was removed a few years ago. A
dozen people have slept in it at the same time.

AUDLEY END AND SAFFRON WALDEN.

Journeying farther from London, and into the county of Essex, we come to the little river Cam,
and on the side of its valley, among the gentle undulations of the Essex uplands, is seen the
palace of Audley End, and beyond it the village of Saffron Walden. Here in earlier times was
the abbey of Walden, which, when dissolved by Henry VIII., was granted to Sir Thomas Audley,
who then stood high in royal favor. But almost all remains of this abbey have disappeared,
and Sir Thomas, who was Speaker of the House, got the grant because of his industry in promoting
the king's wishes for the dissolution of the religious houses, and was also made Lord Audley
of Walden. This, as Fuller tells us, was "a dainty morsel, an excellent receipt to clear the
Speaker's voice, and make him speak clear and well for his master." But he did not live long
to enjoy it, although giving the estate his name, and it passed ultimately to the Duke of Norfolk,
after whose execution it became the property of his son, Lord Thomas Howard, whom Queen Elizabeth
made Baron Walden, and King James appointed lord treasurer and promoted to be Earl of Suffolk.
He built the great palace of Audley End, which was intended to eclipse every palace then existing
in England. It was begun in 1603, and was finished in 1616, the date still remaining upon one
of the gateways. King James twice visited Audley End while building, and is said to have remarked,
as he viewed its enormous proportions, that the house was too large for a king, though it might
do for a lord treasurer. It cost over $1,000,000, but no accurate account was kept, and the
earl was so straitened by the outlay, that after being dismissed from office he was compelled
to sell out several other estates, and died nearly $200,000 in debt. The second and third earls
tried to maintain the white elephant, but found it too heavy a burden, and the latter sold
the house to King Charles II. for $250,000, of which $100,000 remained on mortgage. It was
known as the New Palace, and became a royal residence. It consisted of a large outer court
and a smaller inner one. Around these the buildings were constructed from one to three stories
high, with towers at the corners and centres of the fronts. The impression produced by the
design is said not to have been very favorable, it being insufficiently grand for so vast a
pile, and while it was a pleasant residence in summer, the want of facilities for heating made
it in winter little better than a barn. It was in the following year that the house was sold
to the king. In 1701, however, it passed back to the fifth Earl of Suffolk, and about twenty
years later a large part of the structure was taken down. Three sides of the great court, including
the gallery referred to by Pepys, were demolished, and Audley End was reduced to the buildings
around the smaller quadrangle; this was further reduced in 1749, so that the house assumed
its present appearance of three sides of a square, open towards the east, and thus remains
an excellent type of an early Jacobean mansion, its best view being from the garden front.
Within it has fine apartments, and contains the only authentic portrait of George II. that
is known. This king would never sit for his picture, and the artist by stealth sketched his
likeness from a closet near the staircase of Kensington Palace, where he had an excellent view
of the peculiar monarch. It is, as Thackeray says, the picture of a "red-faced, staring princeling,"
but is believed true to nature nevertheless. Lady Suffolk, it seems, was one of his few favorites.
Audley End has been for a long time in possession of the Barons of Braybrooke, and is their
principal seat. Lord Cornwallis, of American Revolutionary remembrance, was a member of this
family, and his portrait is preserved here.

Over the undulating surface of the park, barely a mile away, can be seen the pretty spire of
Saffron Walden Church, with the village clustering around it. Here on a hill stand the church
and the castle, originally of Walden, but from the extensive cultivation of saffron in the
neighborhood the town came to have that prefix given it; it was grown there from the time of
Edward III., and the ancient historian Fuller quaintly tells us "it is a most admirable cordial,
and under God I owe my life, when sick with the small-pox, to the efficacy thereof." Fuller
goes on to tell us that "the sovereign power of genuine saffron is plainly proved by the antipathy
of the crocodile thereto; for the crocodile's tears are never true save when he is forced where
saffron groweth, whence he hath his name of croco-deilos, or the saffron-fearer, knowing himself
to be all poison, and it all antidote." Saffron attained its highest price at Walden in Charles
II.'s time, when it was as high as twenty dollars a pound, but its disuse in medicine caused
its value to diminish, and at the close of the last century its culture had entirely disappeared
from Walden, though the prefix still clings to the name of the town. While saffron was declining,
this neighborhood became a great producer of truffles, and the dogs were trained here to hunt
the fungus that is so dear to the epicure's palate. The church of St. Mary, which is a fine
Perpendicular structure and the most conspicuous feature of Saffron Walden, was built about
four hundred years ago, though the slender spire crowning its western tower is of later date,
having been built in the present century. In the church are buried the six Earls of Suffolk
who lived at Audley End, and all of whom died between 1709 and 1745. The ruins of the ancient
castle, consisting chiefly of a portion of the keep and some rough arches, are not far from
the church, and little is known of its origin. There is a museum near the ruins which contains
some interesting antiquities and a fine natural-history collection. The newly-constructed town-hall,
built in antique style, overhanging the footway and supported on arches, is one of the most
interesting buildings in Saffron Walden: the mayor and corporation meeting here date their
charter from 1549. Not far away, at Newport, lived Nell Gwynn in a modest cottage with a royal
crown over the door. She was one of the numerous mistresses of Charles II., and is said to
have been the only one who remained faithful to him. She bore him two sons, one dying in childhood,
and the other becoming the Duke of St. Albans, a title created in 1684, and still continued
in the persons of his descendants of the family of Beauclerc. Nell was originally an orange-girl
who developed into a variety actress, and, fascinating the king, he bought her from Lord Buckhurst,
her lover, for an earldom and a pension. Nell is said to have cost the king over $300,000 in
four years. She had her good qualities and was very popular in England, and she persuaded the
king to found Chelsea Hospital for disabled soldiers, and he also bore her genuine affection,
for his dying words were, "Let not poor Nelly starve." She survived him about seven years.
Also in the neighborhood, at Littlebury, was the home of Winstanley, the builder of the first
Eddystone Lighthouse, who perished in it when it was destroyed by a terrific storm in 1703.

Digressing down to the coast of Essex, on the North Sea, we find at the confluence of the Stour
and Orwell the best harbor on that side of England, bordered by the narrow and old-fashioned
streets of the ancient seaport of Harwich. Here vast fleets seek shelter in easterly gales
behind the breakwater that is run out from the Beacon Hill. From here sail many steamers to
Rotterdam and Antwerp in connection with the railways from London, and the harbor-entrance
is protected by the ancient Languard Fort, built by James I. on a projecting spit of land now
joined to the Suffolk coast to the northward. One of the most interesting scenes at Harwich
is a group of old wrecks that has been utilized for a series of jetties in connection with
a shipbuilder's yard. Weather-beaten and battered, they have been moored in a placid haven,
even though it be on the unpicturesque coast of Essex.

CAMBRIDGE.

Returning to the valley of the Cam, we will follow it down to the great university city of
Cambridge, fifty-eight miles north of London. It stands in a wide and open valley, and is built
on both banks of the river, which is navigable up to this point, so that the town is literally
the "Bridge over the Cam." The situation is not so picturesque or so favorable as that of the
sister university city of Oxford, but it is nevertheless an attractive city, the stately buildings
being admirably set off by groups and avenues of magnificent trees that flourish nowhere to
better advantage than in English scenery. The chief colleges are ranged along the right bank
of the Cam, with their fronts away from the water, while behind each there is a sweep of deliciously
green meadowland known as the "Backs of the Colleges," surrounded by trees, and with a leafy
screen of foliage making the background beyond the buildings. While the greater part of modern
Cambridge is thus on the right bank of the river, the oldest portion was located on a low plateau
forming the opposite shore. It is uncertain when the university was first established there.
Henry Beauclerc, the youngest son of William the Conqueror, studied the arts and sciences at
Cambridge, and when he became king he bestowed many privileges upon the town and fixed a regular
ferry over the Cam. By the thirteenth century scholars had assembled there and become a recognized
body, according to writs issued by Henry III. In 1270 the title of a university was formally
bestowed, and the oldest known collegiate foundation--Peterhouse, or St. Peter's College--had
been established a few years before. Cambridge has in all seventeen colleges, and the present
act of incorporation was granted by Queen Elizabeth. The Duke of Devonshire is the chancellor.
The student graduates either "in Honors" or "in the Poll." In the former case he can obtain
a distinction in mathematics, classics, the sciences, theology, etc. The names of the successful
students are arranged in three classes in a list called the Tripos, a name derived from the
three-legged stool whereon sat in former days one of the bachelors, who recited a set of satirical
verses at the time the degrees were conferred. In the Mathematical Tripos the first class are
called Wranglers, and the others Senior and Junior Optimes. Thus graduate the "Dons" of Cambridge.

TRINITY AND ST. JOHN'S COLLEGES.

Let us now take a brief review of the seventeen colleges of Cambridge. In Trinity Street is
Trinity College, founded in 1546 by Henry VIII. It consists of four quadrangular courts, the
Great Court being the largest quadrangle in the university, and entered from the street by
the grand entrance-tower known as the King's Gateway. On the northern side of the quadrangle
are the chapel and King Edward's Court, and in the centre of the southern side the Queen's
Tower, with a statue of Queen Mary. In the centre of the quadrangle is a quaint conduit. The
chapel is a plain wainscoted room, with an ante-chapel filled with busts of former members
of the college--among them Bacon and Macaulay--and also a noble statue of Newton. Trinity College
Hall is one hundred feet long and the finest in Cambridge, its walls being adorned with several
portraits. It was in Trinity that Byron, Dryden, Cowley, Herbert, and Tennyson were all students.
There are said to be few spectacles more impressive than the choral service on Sunday evening
in term-time, when Trinity Chapel is crowded with surpliced students. In the Master's Lodge,
on the western side of the quadrangle, are the state-apartments where royalty is lodged when
visiting Cambridge, and here also in special apartments the judges are housed when on circuit.
Through screens or passages in the hall the second quadrangle, Neville's Court, is entered,
named for a master of the college who died in 1615. Here is the library, an attractive apartment
supported on columns, which contains Newton's telescope and some of his manuscripts, and also
a statue of Byron. The King's (or New) Court, is a modern addition, built in the present century
at a cost of $200,000. From this the College Walks open on the western side, the view from
the gateway looking down the long avenue of lime trees being strikingly beautiful. The Master's
Court is the fourth quadrangle.

Adjoining Trinity is its rival, St. John's College, also consisting of four courts, though
one of them is of modern construction and on the opposite bank of the river. This college was
founded by the countess Margaret of Richmond, mother of Henry VII., and opened in 1516, having
been for three centuries previously a hospital. It is generally regarded from this circumstance
as being the oldest college at Cambridge. The gateway is a tower of mingled brick and stone
and one of the earliest structures of the college. Entering it, on the opposite side of the
court is seen the New Chapel, but recently completed, a grand edifice one hundred and seventy-two
feet long and sixty-three feet high, with a surmounting tower whose interior space is open
and rises eighty-four feet above the pavement. The roof and the windows are richly colored,
and variegated marbles have been employed in the interior decoration. The eastern end is a
five-sided apse; the ceiling is vaulted in oak, while the chapel has a magnificent screen.
Between the first and second courts is the hall, recently enlarged and decorated, and the library
is on the northern side of the third court. It is a picturesque room of James I.'s time, with
a timbered roof, whitened walls, and carved oaken bookcases black with age. The second court
is of earlier date, and a fine specimen of sixteenth-century brickwork. On the southern side
is an octagonal turret, at the top of which is the queer little room occupied by Dr. Wood,
whose statue is in the chapel. When he first came to college from his humble home in the north
of England he was so poor that he studied by the light of the staircase candle, and wrapped
his feet in wisps of hay in winter to save the cost of a fire. He became the Senior Wrangler,
and in due course a Fellow, and ultimately master of the college. To this was added the deanery
of Ely. Dying, he bequeathed his moderate fortune for the aid of poor students and the benefit
of his college. Of the third court the cloister on the western side fronts the river. The New
Court, across the Cam, is a handsome structure, faced with stone and surmounted by a tower.
A covered Gothic bridge leads to it over the river from the older parts of the college. In
the garden along the river, known as the Wilderness, Prior the poet is said to have laid out
the walks. Here among the students who have taken recreation have been Wordsworth and Herschel,
Wilberforce and Stillingfleet.

CAIUS AND CLARE COLLEGES.

It took two founders to establish Gonville and Caius College, and both their names are preserved
in the title, though it is best known as Caius (pronounced Keys) College. Its buildings were
ancient, but have been greatly changed in the present century, so that the chief entrance is
now beneath a lofty tower, part of the New Court and fronting the Senate House. This New Court
is a fine building, ornamented with busts of the most conspicuous men of Caius. Beyond is the
smaller or Caius Court of this college, constructed in the sixteenth century. The "Gate of
Virtue and Wisdom" connects them, and is surmounted by an odd turret. On the other side is
the "Gate of Honor," a good specimen of the Renaissance. The "Gate of Humility" was removed
in rebuilding the New Court. Thus did this college give its students veritable sermons in stones.
The founders of Caius were physicians, and among its most eminent members were Hervey and Jeremy
Taylor. Adjoining Caius is Trinity Hall, as noted for the law as its neighbor is for medicine,
and immediately to the south is a group of university buildings. Among these is the Senate
House, opened in 1730, where the university degrees are conferred. It has a fine interior,
especially the ceiling, and among the statues is an impressive one of the younger Pitt. The
most exciting scene in the Senate House is when the result of the mathematical examination
is announced. This for a long time was almost the only path to distinction at Cambridge. When
all are assembled upon a certain Friday morning in January, one of the examiners stands up
in the centre of the western gallery and just as the clock strikes nine proclaims to the crowd
the name of the "Senior Wrangler," or first student of the year, with a result of deafening
cheers; then the remainder of the list is read. On the following day the recipients of degrees
and visitors sit on the lower benches, and the undergraduates cram the galleries. Then with
much pomp the favored student is conducted to the vice-chancellor to receive his first degree
alone. The University Library is near by, and, as it gets a copy of every book entered for
English copyright, it has become a large one. Some of the manuscripts it contains are very
valuable, particularly the Codex Beza, a manuscript of the Gospels given in 1581 by Beza.

Adjoining Trinity Hall is the beautiful court of Clare College, dating from the time of the
Civil Wars, when it replaced older structures. Its exterior is most attractive to visitors,
exhibiting the pleasing architecture of the sixteenth century. The river-front is much admired,
while the gateway is marked by quaint lantern-like windows. In the library is one of the rare
Bibles of Sixtus V., and in the Master's Lodge is kept the poison-cup of Clare, which is both
curious and beautiful. The gentle lady's mournful fate has been told by Scott in Marmion. Tillotson
and other famous divines were students at Clare, and the college also claims Chaucer, but this
is doubtful, though the college figures in his story of the "Miller of Trumpington," and also
adjuts upon Trumpington Street. Upon the opposite side of this street is Great St. Mary's Church,
the university church, an attractive building of Perpendicular architecture and having fine
chimes of bells. Here the vice chancellor listens to a sermon every Sunday afternoon in term-time.
Formerly, on these occasions, the "heads and doctors" of the university sat in an enclosed
gallery built like a sort of gigantic opera-box, and profanely called the "Golgotha." A huge
pulpit faced them on the other end of the church, and the centre formed a sort of pit. Modern
improvements have, however, swept this away, replacing it with ordinary pews.

KING'S, CORPUS CHRISTI, AND QUEENS' COLLEGES.

Trumpington Street broadens into the King's Parade, and here, entered through a modern buttressed
screen pierced with openings filled with tracery, is King's College. It was founded by Henry
VI. in 1440, and in immediate connection with the school at Eton, from which the more advanced
scholars were to be transferred. The great King's Chapel, which gives an idea of the grand
scale on which this college was to be constructed, is the special boast of Cambridge. It is
two hundred and eighty feet long, forty-five feet wide, and seventy-eight feet high, with a
marvellously fretted roof of stone, and large windows at the sides and ends filled with beautiful
stained glass. This is the most imposing of all the buildings in Cambridge, and occupies the
entire northern side of the college court. Its fine doorway is regarded as the most pleasing
part of the exterior design. The stained-glass windows are divided into an upper and lower
series of pictures. The lower is a continuous chain of gospel history, while the upper exhibits
the Old-Testament types of the subjects represented below. Although designed on such a magnificent
scale, the Wars of the Roses interfered with the completion of King's College, and even the
chapel was not finished until Henry VIII.'s reign. The other college buildings are modern.

Adjoining King's is Corpus Christi College, the buildings being almost entirely modern. Of
the ancient structure one small court alone remains, a picturesque steep-roofed building almost
smothered in ivy. Corpus Christi Hall is said to have been partly designed after the great
hall of Kenilworth. In its library are the famous manuscripts rescued from the suppressed monasteries,
there being four hundred interesting and curious volumes of these precious documents, which
are most jealously guarded. Opposite Corpus is St. Catharine's College, with a comparatively
plain hall and chapel. Behind this is Queens' College, an antique structure, though not a very
ancient foundation. Its entrance-tower is of brick, and a quaint low cloister runs around the
interior court. Within is Erasmus's Court, where are pointed out the rooms once occupied by
that great scholar. Across the river a wooden bridge leads to a terrace by the water-side with
an overhanging border of elms, and known as Erasmus's Walk. This college was founded by the
rival queens, Margaret of Anjou and Elizabeth Widvile, and though it is very proud of having
had the great scholar of the Reformation within its halls, he does not seem to have entirely
reciprocated the pleasure; for he complains in a letter to a friend that while there "he was
blockaded with the plague, beset with thieves, and drugged with bad wine." Returning to Trumpington
Street, we find on the western side the University Printing Press, named from the younger statesman
the Pitt Press. He represented the university in Parliament, and the lofty square and pinnacled
tower of this printing-office is one of the most conspicuous objects in Cambridge. Yet even
this structure has its contrasts, for the "Cantabs" consider that its architecture is as bad
as its typography is good.

OTHER CAMBRIDGE COLLEGES.

Pembroke College, near the Pitt Press, has a chapel designed by Christopher Wren and recently
enlarged. This was the college of Spenser and Gray, the latter having migrated from the neighboring
Peterhouse because of the practical jokes the students played upon him. It was also Pitt's
college. Opposite Pembroke is Peterhouse, or St. Peter's College, the most ancient foundation
in Cambridge, established by Hugh de Balsham, Bishop of Ely, in 1284. Beyond Peterhouse is
the Fitzwilliam Museum, a most successful reproduction of classic architecture, built and maintained
by a legacy of $500,000 left by Viscount Fitzwilliam in 1816. It contains an excellent art
and literary collection, which was begun by the viscount. This is regarded as probably the
finest classical building constructed in the present century in England. A short distance beyond,
at the end of a water-course, is an attractive hexagonal structure with niched recesses and
ornamental capstones. This is Hobson's Conduit, erected in 1614 by Thomas Hobson. This benefactor
of Cambridge was a carrier between London and the university, and is said to have been the
originator of "Hobson's Choice." The youngest foundation at Cambridge is Downing College, erected
in 1807, an unobtrusive structure, and near by is Emmanuel College, built on the site of a
Dominican convent and designed by Wren. It was founded by Sir Walter Mildmay, the Puritan,
in 1584, who on going to court was taxed by Queen Mary with having erected a Puritan college.
Sir William Temple was educated at Emmanuel. Christ's College is near by, chiefly interesting
from its associations with Milton, whose rooms are still pointed out, while a mulberry tree
that he planted is preserved in the garden. Latimer and Paley, with a host of other divines,
were students here. This college was founded by Queen Margaret, mother of Henry VII., and some
beautiful silver plate, her gift to the Fellows, is still preserved. At Sidney-Sussex College
Cromwell was a Fellow in 1616, and his crayon portrait hangs in the dining-hall. Owing to want
of means, he left without taking a degree. An oriel window projecting over the street is said
to mark his chamber. Upon Bridge Street is the Round Church, or St. Sepulchre's Church, obtaining
its name from its circular Norman nave, this being one of the four "Temple churches" still
remaining in England. Across the Cam stands Magdalene College, founded in 1519 by Baron Thomas
Audley of Walden. Within the building behind it are the literary collections of Samuel Pepys,
who was secretary to the Admiralty in the reigns of Charles II. and James II., together with
the manuscript of his famous diary, a book of marvellous gossip, recording the peccadilloes
of its author, the jealousy of his wife, and the corruptions of the court. He was educated
at Magdalene.

Jesus Lane leads out of Bridge Street to Jesus College, remotely placed on the river-bank,
and of which the chief building of interest is the chapel, a fine Gothic structure. This college
is upon the site of a Benedictine nunnery founded in 1133, and is entered by a lofty brick
gate-tower which is much admired, and was constructed soon after the foundation of the college
in 1497 by the Bishop of Ely, whose successors until this day retain the gift of the mastership.
From Jesus Lane a path leads down to the boat-houses on the river bank, where each college
has a boat-club wearing a distinctive dress. The racecourse is at the Long Reach, just below
the town. Of the ancient Cambridge Castle, built by the Conqueror in 1068, nothing remains
but the mound upon Castle Hill, where the county courts are now located. Cambridge, however,
has little besides its university buildings to attract attention. In the suburbs are two colleges
for the instruction of lady students, and two miles away is Trumpington, near which is the
site of the mill told of in Chaucer's Canterbury tale of the Miller of Trumpington. The place
is now used for gates to admit the river-water into Byron's Pool, which is so called because
the poet frequently bathed in it when he was an undergraduate of Trinity College.

THE FENLAND.

The river Cam below Cambridge flows through that country of reclaimed marshland which ultimately
ends in the Wash, between Norfolk and Lincolnshire, and is known as the Fenland. This "Great
Level of the Fens" has been drained and reclaimed by the labors of successive generations of
engineers, and contains about six hundred and eighty thousand acres of the richest lands in
England, being as much the product of engineering skill as Holland itself. Not many centuries
ago this vast surface, covering two thousand square miles, was entirely abandoned to the waters,
forming an immense estuary of the Wash, into which various rivers discharge the rainfall of
Central England. In winter it was an inland sea and in summer a noxious swamp. The more elevated
parts were overgrown with tall reeds that in the distance looked like fields of waving corn,
and immense flocks of wild-fowl haunted them. Into this dismal swamp the rivers brought down
their freshets, the waters mingling and winding by devious channels before they reached the
sea. The silt with which they were laden became deposited in the basin of the Fens, and thus
the river-beds were choked up, compelling the intercepted waters to force new channels through
the ooze; hence there are numerous abandoned beds of old rivers still traceable amid the level
of the Fens. This region now is drained and dyked, but in earlier times it was a wilderness
of shallow waters and reedy islets, with frequent "islands" of firmer and more elevated ground.
These were availed of for the monasteries of the Fenland--Ely, Peterborough, Crowland, and
others, all established by the Benedictines. The abbey of Bury St. Edmunds, although situated
some distance from the marshland, may also be classed among the religious houses of the Fens.
This abbey, which is a short distance east of Cambridge, was built in the eleventh century
as the shrine of St. Edmund, King of East Anglia, who was killed by the Danes about the year
870. It soon became one of the wealthiest English monasteries, and was the chief religious
centre of that section. Only ruins remain, the chief being the abbey-gate, now the property
of the Marquis of Bristol, and the Norman tower and church, which have recently been restored.
In the suburbs of Bury is Hengrave Hall, one of the most interesting Tudor mansions remaining
in the kingdom. Originally, it was three times its present size, and was built by Sir Thomas
Kytson about 1525. Its gate-house is rich in details, and the many windows and projections
of the southern front group picturesquely.

Following the Cam northward from Cambridge through the marshland, we come to the Isle of Ely,
the great "fortress of the Fens," and standing upon its highest ground the cathedral of Ely.
Here St. Etheldreda founded a monastery in the seventh century, which ultimately became a cathedral,
Ely having been given a bishop in 1109. The present buildings date all the way from the eleventh
to the sixteenth century, so that they give specimens of all Gothic styles. The cathedral is
five hundred and thirty-seven feet long, and from the summit of its western tower can be gained
a fine view of the spreading fens and lowlands of Cambridgeshire, amid which stands the Isle
of Ely. One of the finest views of this tower is that obtained from the road leading to Ely
Close. Before drainage had improved the surrounding country this was one of the strongest fortresses
in England, and it was also one of the last to yield to the Norman Conquest, its reduction
causing King William heavy loss. Afterwards he regarded it as among his most loyal strongholds.
The lofty tower, and indeed the whole cathedral, are landmarks for the entire country round,
and from the rising ground at Cambridge, fully twenty miles to the southward, can be seen standing
out against the sky. From the dykes and fields and meadows that have replaced the marshes along
the Cam and Ouse the huge tower can be seen looming up in stately grandeur. It is almost the
sole attraction of the sleepy little country town. The great feature of this massive cathedral
is the wonderful central octagon, with its dome-like roof crowned by a lofty lantern, which
is said to be the only Gothic dome of its kind in existence in England or France. We are told
that the original cathedral had a central tower, which for some time showed signs of instability,
until on one winter's morning in 1321 it came down with an earthquake crash and severed the
cathedral into four arms. In reconstructing it, to ensure security, the entire breadth of the
church was taken as a base for the octagon, so that it was more than three times as large as
the original square tower. Magnificent windows are inserted in the exterior faces of the octagon,
and the entire cathedral has been recently restored. It was to Bishop Cox, who then presided
over the see of Ely, that Queen Elizabeth, when he objected to the alienation of certain church
property, wrote her famous letter:

     "PROUD PRELATE: You know what you were before I made you what you
     are; if you do not immediately comply with my request, by God, I
     will unfrock you."

  "ELIZABETH R."

The bishop, it is almost unnecessary to say, surrendered. The town contains little of interest
beyond some quaint old houses.

PETERBOROUGH CATHEDRAL.

North-westward of Ely, and just on the border of the Fenland, Saxulf, a thane of Mercia who
had acquired great wealth, founded the first and most powerful of the great Benedictine abbeys
of this region in the year 655. Around this celebrated religious house has grown the town of
Peterborough, now one of the chief railway-junctions in Midland England. The remains of the
monastic buildings, and especially of the cathedral, are magnificent, the great feature of
the latter being its western front, which was completed in the thirteenth century, and has
three great open arches, making probably the finest church-portico in Europe. On the left of
the cathedral is the chancel of Becket's Chapel, now a grammar-school, while on the right is
the ancient gateway of the abbot's lodgings, which has become the entrance to the bishop's
palace. The main part of the cathedral is Norman, though portions are Early English. It is
built in the form of a cross, with a smaller transept at the western end, while the choir terminates
in an apse, and a central tower rises from four supporting arches. Within the cathedral, over
the doorway, is a picture of old Scarlet, Peterborough's noted sexton, who buried Catharine
of Arragon and Mary Queen of Scots. The nave has an ancient wooden roof, carefully preserved
and painted with various devices. The transept arches are fine specimens of Norman work. Queen
Catharine lies under a slab in the aisle of St. John's Chapel, but the remains of Queen Mary
were removed to Westminster Abbey by James I., to the magnificent tomb he prepared there for
his mother.

CROWLAND ABBEY.

Farther northward in the Fenland, and over the border in Lincolnshire, was the Benedictine
abbey of "courteous Crowland," though its remains are now scanty. It derives its name from
the "Land of Crows," which in this part is drained by the Welland River and the great Bedford
Level. On one of the many islands of firmer soil abounding in this oozy region the monks constructed
their monastery, but had little space for cultivation, and brought their food from remoter
possessions. Now, Crowland is no longer an island, for the drainage has made fast land all
about, and the ruins have attracted a straggling village. Here is the famous "triangular bridge,"
a relic of the abbey. Three streams met, and the bridge was made to accommodate the monks,
who, from whatever direction they approached, had to cross one of them. The streams now are
conveyed underground, but the bridge remains like a stranded monster which the tide has abandoned,
and gives the children a play-place. Its steep half-arches, meeting in the centre, are climbed
by rough steps. The dissolved abbey served as a quarry for the village, and hence on this strange
bridge and on all the houses fragments of worked stone and of sculpture everywhere appear.
It was located at the eastern end of the village, where its ruins still stand up as a guide
across the fens, seen from afar. Most of it is in complete ruin, but the north aisle of the
nave has been sufficiently preserved to serve as the parish church of Crowland; round about
the church and the ruins extends the village graveyard. Set up in the porch beneath the tower
is a memorial for William Hill, the sexton, who died in 1792. When forty years old he was blinded
by exposure during a snowfall, yet he lived for twenty-five years afterwards, able to find
his way everywhere and to know every grave in the churchyard.

In the earlier days of Christianity the solitudes in this Fenland had peculiar attractions
for the hermits who fled from the world to embrace an ascetic life. Thus the islands each gradually
got its hermit, and the great monasteries grew up by degrees, starting usually in the cell
of some recluse. Guthlac, who lived in the seventh century, was of the royal House of Mercia,
and voluntarily exiled himself in the Fens. This region was then, according to popular belief,
the haunt of myriads of evil spirits, who delighted in attacking the hermits. They assaulted
Guthlac in hosts, disturbed him by strange noises, once carried him far away to the icy regions
of the North, and not seldom took the form of crows, the easier to torment him; but his steady
prayers and penance ultimately put them to flight, and the existence of his cell became known
to the world. Ethelbald fled to Guthlac for refuge, and the hermit predicted he would become
king, which in time came to pass. Guthlac died at Crowland, and the grateful king built a stone
church there. The buildings increased, their great treasure being of course the tomb of the
hermit, which became a source of many miracles. The Northmen in the ninth century plundered
and destroyed Crowland, but it was restored, and in Edward the Confessor's time was one of
the five religious houses ruled by the powerful abbot of Peterborough. It became the shrine
of Waltheof, the Earl of Northampton beheaded for opposing William the Conqueror, and Crowland
was thus made a stronghold of English feeling against the Normans, like the other monasteries
of the Fens. Its fame declined somewhat after the Conquest, though its hospitality was fully
maintained. It had little subsequent history. The abbey was garrisoned by the Royalists, and
captured by Cromwell in 1643, after which it fell into ruin. Such has been the fate of almost
all the religious houses in the Fens, the merits of which the people in the olden time judged
according to a local rhyme which yet survives:

  "Ramsay, the bounteous of gold and of fee;
  Crowland, as courteous as courteous may be;
  Spalding the rich, and Peterborough the proud;
  Sawtrey, by the way, that poor abbaye,
  Gave more alms in one day than all they."

NORWICH.

Proceeding eastward out of the Fenland and among the hills of Norfolk, the little river Wensum
is found to have cut a broad, deep, and trench-like valley into the chalk and gravel plateau.
Upon the elevated bank of the river is the irregularly picturesque town of Norwich, with the
castle keep rising above the undulating mass of buildings, and the cathedral and its noble
spire overtopping the lower portion of the city on the right hand. Norwich is an ancient town,
but very little is known with certainty about it anterior to the Danish invasions. We are told
that its original location was at the more southerly castle of Caister, whence the inhabitants
migrated to the present site, for--

  "Caister was a city when Norwich was none,
  And Norwich was built of Caister stone."

Canute held possession of Norwich and had a castle there, but the present castle seems to date
from the Norman Conquest, when it was granted to Ralph de Quader, who turned traitor to the
king, causing Norfolk to be besieged, captured, and greatly injured. Then the castle was granted
to Roger Bigod. The town grew, and became especially prosperous from the settlement there of
numerous Flemish weavers in the fourteenth century and of Walloons in Elizabeth's reign. It
managed to keep pretty well out of the Civil Wars, but a local historian says, "The inhabitants
have been saved from stagnation by the exceeding bitterness with which all party and local
political questions are discussed and contested, and by the hearty way in which all classes
throw themselves into all really patriotic movements, when their party feeling occasionally
sleeps for a month or two." Norwich is pre-eminently a town of churches, into the construction
of which flint enters largely, it being dressed with great skill into small roughened cubical
blocks.

The great attraction of Norwich is the cathedral, which stands upon a low peninsula enclosed
by a semicircular sweep of the river, much of the ground in this region having been originally
a swamp. The cathedral is generally approached from its western side, where there is an open
space in front of the Close called Tombland, upon which two gates open from it. These are St.
Ethelbert's and the Erpingham gate. The latter, opposite the western front of the cathedral,
is named for its builder, "old Sir Thomas Erpingham," whose "good white head," Shakespeare
tells us, was to be seen on the field of Agincourt. The cathedral is a Norman structure, cruciform
in plan, with an exceptionally long nave, an apsidal choir, and attached chapels. The earliest
parts of it were begun in 1096, and when partially completed five years afterwards it was handed
over to the care of the Benedictine monks. Thirty years later the nave was added, but the cathedral
was not completed until about 1150. Twice it was seriously injured by fire, and it was not
thoroughly restored for a century, when in 1278 it was again consecrated with great pomp, in
the presence of Edward I. and his court, on Advent Sunday. The spire, which is one of its most
conspicuous features, was added by Bishop Percy in the fourteenth century, though, having been
seriously injured by lightning, it had to be replaced afterwards. At the same time the building
was greatly altered, its roofs raised and vaulted, and repairs went on until 1536. Yet, with
all the changes that were made in this famous cathedral, no other in England has managed to
preserve its original plan so nearly undisturbed.

Entering the nave from the westward, this grand apartment is found to extend two hundred and
fifty feet, and to the intersection of the transepts comprises fourteen bays, three of them
being included in the choir. The triforium is almost as lofty as the nave-arches, and the solidity
of these, surmounted by the grandeur of the upper arcade, gives a magnificent aspect to the
nave. Above is the fine vaulted roof, the elaborately carved bosses giving a series of scenes
from sacred history extending from the Creation to the Last Judgment. Small chapels were originally
erected against the organ-screen, one of them being dedicated to the young St. William, a Norfolk
saint who in the twelfth century was tortured and crucified by some Jews. His body, clandestinely
buried in a wood, was found, miracles were wrought, and it was translated to the cathedral.
The Jews of Norwich were then attacked and plundered, and these outrages were renewed a century
later. But times have fortunately changed since then. The choir extends to the eastern apse,
and at the back of the altar recent alterations have exposed an interesting relic in a fragment
of the original bishop's throne, an elevated chair of stone placed in the middle of the apse
and looking westward. On either side are apsidal chapels. Among the monuments is that to Sir
William Boleyn, grandfather to the unfortunate Anne Boleyn. He lived at Blickling, about thirteen
miles from Norwich, where Anne is believed to have been born. Several bishops also lie in the
cathedral, and among the later tombs is that of Dr. Moore, who died in 1779, and whose periwigged
head is in grotesque juxtaposition with a cherub making an ugly face and appearing to be drying
his eyes with his shirt. The spire of Norwich Cathedral rises two hundred and eighty-seven feet.

Norwich Castle is a massive block of masonry crowning the summit of a mound. Who first built
it is unknown, but he is said by popular tradition to sit buried in his chair and full armed
deep down in the centre of this mound, and "ready for all contingencies." But the castle has
degenerated into a jail, and the great square tower or keep, ninety-five feet square and seventy
feet high, is the only part of the original structure remaining. It has been refaced with new
stone, and the interior has also been completely changed. The moat is planted with trees, and
on the outside slope the cattle-market is held every Saturday. Norwich has some historical
structures. In its grammar school Nelson was a scholar, and his statue stands on the green.
On the edge of Tombland stands the house of Sir John Falstaff, a brave soldier and friend of
literature, whose memory is greatly prized in Norfolk, but whose name has been forgotten by
many in the shadow of Shakespeare's "Fat Jack." The chief centre of the town, however, is the
market-place, on the slope of a hill, where modernized buildings have replaced some of the
more antique structures. Here stands the ancient Guildhall, which in 1413 replaced the old
Tolbooth where the market-dues were paid. Within is the sword surrendered to Nelson by Admiral
Winthuysen at the battle of St. Vincent, and by him presented to the chief city of his native
county of Norfolk. In the olden time the glory of Norwich was the Duke of Norfolk's palace,
but it was destroyed at the end of the seventeenth century by the then duke in a fit of anger
because the mayor would not permit his troop of players to march through the town with trumpets
blowing. Not a brick of it now stands, the site being covered with small houses. Norwich was
formerly famous for its trade in woollens, the Dutch introducing them at the neighboring village
of Worsted, whence the name. Now, the coal-mines have aided the spinning-jenny, but the worsteds
are overshadowed by other Norwich manufactures. Colman's mustard-factories cover ten acres,
and Barnard's ornamental iron-work from Norwich is world-renowned. Norwich also contains an
enormous brewery, but in this the city is not singular, for what is a Briton without his beer?

BURGHLEY HOUSE.

On the banks of the Welland River, a short distance above Crowland, is Stamford, in Lincolnshire,
near which is located the well-known Burghley House, the home of Lord Treasurer Cecil, whose
history is referred to in the notice of Hatfield House. This mansion, which is a short distance
south of Stamford, is now the seat of the Marquis of Exeter, William Allayne Cecil. It is said
to have furnished the text for Lord Bacon's "Essay on Building," it having been completed but
a short time previously. The plans of this famous house are still preserved in London. It is
a parallelogram built around an open court, with a lofty square tower projecting from the western
front, and having octangular turrets at the angles. The northern (which is the main) front
is divided into three compartments, and bears on the parapet 1587 as the date when the house
was finished. Within the building a long corridor, commanding a view of the inner court, leads
to a stone staircase which rises to the top of the structure and is peculiarly decorated. There
is a fine chapel, and in an adjoining room was Giordano's renowned painting of "Seneca Dying
in the Bath," which was eulogized in Prior's poems, he having seen it there, though it is now
removed. One of the most interesting pictures in the gallery is that of Henry Cecil, the tenth
Earl and the first Marquis of Exeter, his wife, and daughter. Tennyson has woven the romance
of their marriage into a poem. Cecil, before coming into his title, was living in seclusion
in Shropshire, and fell in love with a farmer's daughter. He married her under an assumed name,
and only disclosed his true rank when, succeeding to his uncle's title and estates, he became
the lord of Burghley and took her home to Burghley House.

The building has many attractive apartments, including a ball-room and Queen Elizabeth's chamber,
but it is doubted whether the maiden queen ever visited it, though she did stay at Burghley's
house in Stamford, and here made the celebrated speech to her old minister in which she said
that his head and her purse could do anything. Burghley's eldest son, Thomas, was created Earl
of Exeter, and his descendants are now in possession of the house. His younger son, Robert,
as previously related, was made Earl of Salisbury, and his descendants hold Hatfield House.
The apartments at Burghley are filled with historical portraits. The grand staircase on the
southern side of the house is finer than the other, but is not so full of character. The gardens
of Burghley were planned by "Capability Brown," the same who laid out Kew. He imperiously overruled
King George III. in the gardening at Kew, and when he died the king is said to have exclaimed
with a sigh of relief to the under-gardener, "Brown is dead; now you and I can do what we please
here." Within St. Martin's Church in Stamford is the canopied tomb of the lord treasurer, constructed
of alabaster, and bearing his effigy clad in armor, with the crimson robes of the Garter; it
is surrounded with the tombs of his descendants. It was into Stamford that Nicholas Nickleby
rode through the snowstorm, and the coach stopped at the George Inn, which was a popular hostelrie
in the days of Charles II., as it still remains.

North of Stamford, on the river Witham, is the interesting town of Grantham, containing the
quaint grammar-school founded by Bishop Fox of Winchester in 1528 where Sir Isaac Newton was
educated. It is recorded by tradition that his career here was not very brilliant as a scholar--a
circumstance which may be told, if for nothing else, at least for the encouragement of some
of the school-boys of a later generation.

LINCOLN.

Continuing northward down the river Witham, we come to a point where the stream has carved
in a limestone-capped plateau a magnificent valley, which, changing its course to the eastward,
ultimately broadens on its route to the sea into a wide tract of fenland. Here, upon a grand
site overlooking the marshes and the valley, stands the city of Lincoln, with its cathedral
crowning the top of the hill, while the town-buildings spread down the slope to the riverbank
at Brayford Pool, from which the Witham is navigable down to Boston, near the coast, and ultimately
discharges into the Wash. The Pool is crowded with vessels and bordered by warehouses, and
it receives the ancient Fosse Dyke Canal, which was dug by the Romans to connect the Witham
with the more inland river Trent. This was the Roman colony of Lindum, from which the present
name of Lincoln is derived, and the noble cathedral crowns the highest ground, known as Steep
Hill. William the Conqueror conferred upon Bishop Remigius of Fecamp the see of Dorchester,
and he founded in 1075 this celebrated cathedral, which, with its three noble towers and two
transepts, is one of the finest in England. Approaching it from the town, at the foot of the
hill is encountered the Stonebow, a Gothic gateway of the Tudor age, which serves as the guild-hall.
The centre of the western front is the oldest part of Lincoln Cathedral, and the gateway facing
it, and forming the chief entrance to the Close, is the Exchequer Gate, an impressive structure
built in the reign of Edward III. The cathedral arcade and the lower parts of the two western
towers and the western doorway were built in the twelfth century. Subsequently an earthquake
shattered the cathedral, and in the thirteenth century it was restored and extended by Bishop
Hugh of Avelon, not being finished until 1315. The massive central tower is supported on four
grand piers composed of twenty-four shafts, and here is hung the celebrated bell of Lincoln,
"Great Tom," which was recast about fifty years ago, and weighs five and a half tons. The transepts
have splendid rose windows, retaining the original stained glass. Lincoln's shrine was that
of St. Hugh, and his choir is surmounted by remarkable vaulting, the eastern end of the church
being extended into the Angel Choir, a beautiful specimen of Decorated Gothic, built in 1282
to accommodate the enormous concourse of pilgrims attracted by St. Hugh's shrine, which stood
in this part of the building. In the cathedral is the tomb of Katherine Swynford, wife of John
of Gaunt. Adjoining the south-eastern transept are the cloisters and chapter-house. The most
ingenious piece of work of the whole structure is the "stone beam," a bridge with a nearly
flat arch, extending between the two western towers over the nave, composed of twenty-two stones,
each eleven inches thick, and vibrating sensibly when stepped upon. There is a grand view from
the towers over the neighboring country and far away down the Witham towards the sea. The exterior
of the cathedral is one of the finest specimens of architecture in the kingdom, its porches,
side-chapels, decorated doorways, sculptured capitals, windows, cloisters, and towers admirably
illustrating every portion of the history of English architecture. Its interior length is four
hundred and eighty-two feet, the great transept two hundred and fifty feet, and the lesser
transept one hundred and seventy feet. The western towers are one hundred and eighty feet high,
and the central tower two hundred and sixty feet, while the width of the cathedral's noble
western front is one hundred and seventy-four feet. Upon the southern side of the hill, just
below it, are the stately ruins of the Bishop's Palace, of which the tower has recently been
restored. Bishop Hugh's ruined Great Hall is now overgrown with ivy, but the walls can be climbed
to disclose a glorious view of the cathedral.

The ancient Ermine Street of the Romans enters Lincoln through the best preserved piece of
Roman masonry in England, the Newport Gate of two arches, where on either hand may be seen
fragments of the old wall. Near the south-east corner of this originally walled area William
the Conqueror built Lincoln Castle, with its gate facing the cathedral. The ruins are well
preserved, and parts of the site are now occupied by the jail and court-house. Within this
old castle King Stephen besieged the empress Maud, but though he captured it she escaped. Her
partisans recaptured the place, and Stephen in the second siege was made a prisoner. It suffered
many sieges in the troubled times afterwards. In the Civil War the townspeople supported the
king, but being attacked they retreated to the castle and cathedral, which were stormed and
taken by the Parliamentary army. Afterwards the castle was dismantled. One of the interesting
remains in Lincoln is the "Jew's House," the home in the Hebrew quarter of a Jewess who was
hanged for clipping coin in the reign of Edward I. But the noble cathedral is the crowning
glory of this interesting old city, the massive structure, with its three surmounting towers
standing on high, being visible for many miles across the country around.

NOTTINGHAM.

We will now cross over the border from Lincoln into Nottinghamshire, and, seeking the valley
of the Trent, find upon the steep brow of a cliff by the river the ancient castle of Nottingham,
which is now surrounded by the busy machinery of the hosiery-weavers. When it was founded no
one accurately knows, but it is believed to antedate the Roman occupation of the island. As
long ago as the tenth century there was a bridge across the Trent at Snodengahame--meaning
the "dwelling among the rocks"--as it was then called, and afterwards the town suffered from
the Danes. It is also suffered during the troubled reign of King Stephen. The castle was built
by one of the Peverils soon after the Norman Conquest, and was frequently the abode of kings.
It was here that Roger Mortimer was seized prior to being tried and hanged in London. King
David of Scotland and Owen Glendower of Wales were held prisoners in Nottingham Castle, and
from it Richard III. advanced to meet his fate on Bosworth Field, while Charles I. set up his
standard and gathered his army at Nottingham at the opening of the Civil Wars, the blowing
down of the standard by a gale on Castle Hill being taken as ominous of the unfortunate termination
of the conflict. The old castle, which has fallen into ruins, subsequently passed into possession
of the Duke of Newcastle, who cleared away almost the whole of the ancient structure and built
a house upon the site. The city was noted for its manufactures as early as the reign of King
John, and the hand-knitting of stockings was introduced in the sixteenth century. Previously
to that time hosiery had been cut out of cloth, with the seams sewed up the same as outer clothing.
As early as 1589 a machine for weaving was invented, but failing to reap a profit from it,
the inventor, a clergyman, took it to Paris, where he afterwards died broken-hearted. Ultimately,
his apprentices brought the machines back to Nottingham, improved them, and prospered. Many
improvements followed. Jedediah Strutt produced the "Derby ribbed hose;" then the warp-loom
was invented in the last century, and the bobbin-traverse net in 1809. The knitting-machines
have been steadily improved, and now hosiery-making is carried on in extensive factories that
give an individuality to the town. The rapidity with which stockings are reeled off the machines
is astonishing. An ordinary stocking is made in four pieces, which are afterwards sewed or
knitted together by another machine. Some of the looms, however, knit the legs in one piece,
and may be seen working off almost endless woollen tubes, which are afterwards divided into
convenient lengths. Fancy hosiery is knitted according to patterns, the setting up of which
requires great skill. Vast amounts of lace are woven, and in the factories female labor preponderates.
The upper town of Nottingham, clustering around the castle on the river-crag, has a picturesque
aspect from the valley below. Among the features of the lower town is the market-place, a triangular
area of slightly over four acres, where the market is held every Saturday, and where once a
year is also held that great event of Nottingham, the Michaelmas goose fair. Here also disport
themselves at election-times the rougher element, who, from their propensity to bleat when
expressing disapprobation, are known as the "Nottingham lambs," and who claim to be lineal
descendants from that hero of the neighboring Sherwood Forest, Robin Hood.

SOUTHWELL.

We will now go down the valley of the Trent below Nottingham, and, mounting the gentle hills
that border Sherwood Forest, come to the Roman station, Ad Pontem, of which the Venerable Bede
was the historian. Here Paulinus was baptized, and it was early made the site of an episcopal
see. The name was Sudwell at the Norman Conquest, and then it became Southwell, and the noted
minster was one of the favorite residences of the Archbishop of York. It is a quiet, old-fashioned
place, with plenty of comfortable residences, and in a large churchyard on ground sloping away
from the main street, with the ruins of the archbishop's palace near by, is Southwell Minster.
There are few finer examples of a Norman building remaining in England, the three towers, nave,
transepts, and chapter-house forming a majestic group. An enormous western window has been
inserted by later architects, rather to the detriment of the gable, and this produces a singular
effect. The interior of the minster is magnificent. The Norman nave is of eight bays with semicircular
arches, surmounted by a triforium of rows of arches almost equal to those below, and rising
from piers with clustered side-columns. It is nearly three-fourths the height of the lower
stage, and this produces a grand effect. The flat roof is modern, it and the bells having been
replaced after the church was burned in the last century. The ruins of the archiepiscopal palace,
erected six hundred years ago, have been availed of in one portion for a dwelling-house. Wolsey
built part of it, and beneath the battlemented wall enclosing the garden there was not long
ago found the skeleton of a soldier in armor, a relic of the Civil Wars. The name of the town
is derived from its wells. The South Well is a short distance outside the limits in a little
park. The Holy Well, which was inside the minster, is now covered up. Lady Well was just outside
the church-walls, but a clergyman fell into it one dark night and was drowned, and it too has
been closed. St. Catherine's Well was surmounted by a chapel, and is in repute as a cure for
rheumatism. The ancient inn of the Saracen's Head in Southwell, not far from the minster on
the main street, witnessed the closing scene of the Civil War. After the battle of Naseby the
Scotch had reached Southwell, and Montreville, an agent of Cardinal Mazarin, came there to
negotiate on behalf of King Charles in 1646. The Scotch commissioners had rooms in the archiepiscopal
palace, and Montreville lodged at the Saracen's Head. After the negotiations had proceeded
for some time, the king in disguise quitted Oxford in April, and after a devious journey by
way of Newark appeared at Montreville's lodgings on May 6th. On the south side of the inn was
an apartment divided into a dining-room and bedroom, which the king occupied, and in the afternoon,
after dining with the Scotch commissioners, he placed himself in their hands, and was sent
a prisoner to their head-quarters. The canny Scots before leaving stripped the lead from the
roof of the palace, and it afterwards fell into ruin, so that Cromwell, who arrived subsequently,
found it uninhabitable, and then occupied the king's room at the Saracen's Head, his horses
being stabled in Southwell Minster. Southwell since has had an uneventful history.

THE DUKERIES.

Nor far away is the well-known Sherwood Forest, wherein in the olden time lived the famous
forester and bandit Robin Hood. Roaming among its spreading oaks with his robber band, he was
not infrequently a visitor to the bordering towns, sometimes for pleasure, but oftener for
"business." Who Robin was, or exactly when he lived, no one seems to know. He is associated
alike with the unsettled times of Kings John and Richard, with Henry V. and with Jack Cade,
but so much mystery surrounds all reports of him that some do not hesitate to declare Robin
Hood a myth. But whoever he was, his memory and exploits live in many a ballad sung along the
banks of the Trent and in the towns and villages of Sherwood Forest. His abiding-place is now
divided up into magnificent estates, the most famous of them being known as "The Dukeries."
One of them, near Ollerton, is Thoresby Hall, the splendid home of the Earl of Manvers, a park
that is ten miles in circumference. North of this is the stately seat of the Duke of Newcastle--Clumber
Park--charmingly situated between Ollerton and Worksop. From the entrance-lodge a carriage-drive
of over a mile through the well-wooded grounds leads up to the elegant yet homelike mansion.
It is of modern construction, having been built in 1770 and received important additions since.
Before that time the park was a tract of wild woodland, but the then Duke of Newcastle improved
it, and constructed an extensive lake, covering ninety acres, at a cost of $35,000. It was
originally intended for a shooting-box, but this was elaborately extended. In the centre of
the west front is a colonnade, and between the mansion and the lake are fine gardens ornamented
by a large fountain. The owner of Clumber is the lineal representative of the family of Pelham-Clinton--which
first appeared prominently in the reign of Edward I.--and is Henry Pelham Alexander Pelham-Clinton,
sixth Duke of Newcastle. Clumber is rich in ornaments, among them being four ancient Roman
altars, but the most striking feature is the full-rigged ship which with a consort rests upon
the placid bosom of the lake.

Adjoining Clumber Park is the most celebrated of "The Dukeries," Welbeck Abbey, which is one
of the remarkable estates of England, a place peculiar to itself. The mansion is about four
miles from Worksop, and the surrounding park contains a grand display of fine old trees, beneath
which roam extensive herds of deer. Welbeck Abbey of White Canons was founded in the reign
of Henry II., and dedicated to St. James. After the dissolution it was granted to Richard Whalley,
and subsequently passed into possession of Sir Charles Cavendish, a son of the famous Bess
of Hardwicke, whose grandson converted the abbey into an elaborate mansion, leaving little
of the original religious building standing. The present house was constructed in the seventeenth
century, its old riding-house being completed in 1623, and William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle,
who built it, was noted as the most accomplished horseman of his time. For several generations
Welbeck remained in possession of the Dukes of Newcastle, until in the last century an only
daughter and the heiress of the abbey married William Bentinck, the Duke of Portland, thus
carrying the estate over to that family, which now possesses it. The founder of this ducal
house came over from Holland as a page of honor with King William III. The present owner, who
has just succeeded to the title, is the sixth Duke of Portland. The chief feature of the original
Welbeck, the old riding-house, remains, but is no longer used for that purpose. It is a grand
hall, one hundred and seventy-seven feet long, with a massive open-work timber roof of admirable
design. The mansion is full of fine apartments, many of them elaborately decorated, but it
is not from these that the estate gets its present fame. The late Duke of Portland, who was
unmarried, was an eccentric man, and he developed a talent for burrowing underground that made
his house one of the most remarkable in England and consumed enormous sums of money. The libraries
of Welbeck, five superb rooms opening into each other, a spacious hall adjoining, one hundred
and fifty-nine feet long, the stables, large gardens, hothouses, lodges, and other apartments,
are all underground. They have glass roofs of magnificent design. They are approached from
and connected with the rest of the mansion by subterranean passages, and, being lofty rooms,
the cost of this deep digging and of the necessary drainage and other adjuncts may be imagined.
The new riding house, the finest in existence, and also underground, but lighted by an arched
glass roof, is three hundred and seventy-nine by one hundred and six feet, and fifty feet high.
It is elaborately ornamented, and at night is lighted by nearly eight thousand gas-jets. Near
it are the extensive hunting-stables, coach-houses, and that marked feature of Welbeck, the
covered "gallop," one thousand and seventy-two feet long, with large "hanging rooms" at either
end: these too are covered with glass, so as to get their light from the top. The whole place
abounds in subterranean apartments and passages, while above ground are extensive gardens and
dairies. In the gardens are the peach-wall, one thousand feet long, a similar range of pine-houses,
a fruit-arcade of ornamental iron arches stretching nearly a quarter of a mile, with apple
trees trained on one side and pear trees on the other, and extensive beds of flowers and plants.
To construct and maintain all this curious magnificence there are workshops on a grand scale.
This eccentric duke, who practically denied himself to the world, and for years devoted his
time to carrying on these remarkable works at an enormous cost, employed over two thousand
persons in burrowing out the bowels of the earth and making these grand yet strange apartments.
When finished he alone could enjoy them, for Welbeck was for a long time a sealed book to the
outer world. But the eccentric duke died, as all men must, and his successor opened Welbeck
to view and to the astonishment of all who saw it. A few months ago the Prince of Wales and
a noble company visited the strange yet magnificent structure, and then for the first time
the amazed assemblage explored this underground palace in Sherwood Forest, and when their wonder
was satisfied they turned on the myriads of gas-jets, and amid a blaze of artificial light
indulged in a ball--an unwonted scene for the weird old abbey of the eccentric and solitary
duke. Like the fairies and mermaids of old in their underground palaces, the prince and his
friends at Welbeck right merrily

  "Held their courtly revels down, down below."

Also in this neighborhood is Newstead Abbey, the ancient seat of the Byrons. It is about eleven
miles from Nottingham, and was founded by the Augustinians in the time of Henry II. In 1540
it came into possession of Sir John Byron, and a century later was held for King Charles. The
poet Byron's bedroom remains almost as he left it, and on the lawn is the monument to his favorite
dog, "Boatswain." The abbey also contains several relics of Livingstone, the African explorer.
Near it is Robin Hood's Cave, and the neighborhood is full of remains of the famous chieftain,
such as his Hill and his Chair, and Fountain Dale where Robin encountered Friar Tuck.

NEWARK.

Descending again to the banks of the Trent, we come to the causeway which carries over the
flat meadows the Great North Road, the Roman military route to the north of England, which
made it necessary to build a castle to hold the keys to its passage across the river. We are
told that Egbert built the earliest fortress here, but the Danes destroyed it. Leofric, Earl
of Mercia, rebuilt it, and gave the castle the name of the "New Work." But it too fell into
decay, and in 1123 the present castle was built, which though much altered and afterwards sadly
ruined, has come down to the present time. It was here that, after his army was swamped in
the Wash, King John died, some say by poison, but the prosaic historian attributes the sad
result to over-indulgence in "unripe peaches and new beer." In the Civil War it was a royal
stronghold and sent King Charles large numbers of recruits. Then it was besieged by Cromwell,
but stoutly resisted, and Prince Rupert by some brilliant manoeuvres relieved it. Finally,
the king sought refuge within its walls after the defeat at Naseby, and here he was besieged
by the Scotch until his voluntary surrender to them at Southwell, when two days afterwards,
by his order, Newark capitulated to his captors. The Parliamentary forces afterwards dismantled
the castle, and it fell into decay, but it has recently been restored as well as possible,
and the site converted into a public garden. Within the town of Newark are several objects
of interest. At the Saracen's Head Inn, which has existed from the time of Edward III., Sir
Walter Scott tells us that Jeanie Deans slept on her journey from Midlothian to London. The
most striking part of the town is the market-square, which is very large, and is surrounded
by old and interesting houses, several of them projecting completely over the footwalks, and
having the front walls supported upon columns--a most picturesque arrangement. One of these
old houses has windows in continuous rows in the upper stories, having between them wooden
beams and figures moulded in plaster. Through the openings between these old houses can be
seen the church, which is one of the finest parish churches in this district, so celebrated
for the magnificence of its religious houses. Surmounting its Early English tower is a spire
of later date. The plan is cruciform, but with very short transepts, not extending beyond the
aisles, which are wide and stretch the entire length of the church. There is a fine roof of
carved oak, and some of the stained glass and interior paintings are highly prized. It was
at Newark that Thomas Magnus lived and founded the grammar-school at which the antiquarian
Dr. Stukeley was educated, and afterwards the famous Warburton, who became Bishop of Gloucester.

In Newark, about three hundred years ago, there was a tavern called the "Talbot Arms," named
in honor of the Earl of Shrewsbury, whose countess was Mary, daughter of the famous Bess of
Hardwicke by her second husband, Sir William Cavendish. Between the Talbots and the neighboring
family of Stanhopes at Shelford there was a feud, which resulted in the Stanhopes defacing
the tavern-sign. This was not taken notice of by the Earl of Shrewsbury, but the quarrel was
assumed by the imperious countess and her brother, Sir Charles Cavendish. They despatched a
messenger to Sir Thomas Stanhope, accusing him and his son of the insult, and declaring him
a "reprobate and his son John a rascal." Then a few days later they sent a formal defiance:
the Stanhopes avoided a duel as long as possible until they began to be posted as cowards,
and then, having gone to London, whither Cavendish followed them, a duel was arranged with
the younger Stanhope at Lambeth Bridge. They met after several delays, when it was found that
Stanhope had his doublet so thickly quilted as to be almost impenetrable to a sword-thrust.
Then there was a new dispute, and it was proposed they should fight in their shirts, but this
Stanhope declined, pleading a cold. Cavendish offered to lend him a waistcoat, but this too
was declined; then Cavendish waived all objections to the doublet and proposed to fight anyhow,
but the seconds interposed, and the duel was put off. Stanhope was then again posted as a coward,
and he and his adherents were hustled in the streets of London. A few days later Stanhope and
his party were attacked in Fleet Street by the Talbots, and one of the former faction mortally
wounded. The feud went on six years, when one day, Cavendish, riding near his home in Nottinghamshire
with three attendants, was attacked by Stanhope and twenty horsemen. He fought bravely, and
was badly wounded, but killed four and wounded two others of his opponents, when, reinforcements
appearing, the Stanhope party fled, leaving six horses and nearly all their hats and weapons
behind them. But all feuds have an end, and this one ultimately exhausted itself, the families
within a century being united in marriage.

HULL AND BEVERLEY.

Following the Trent down to the Humber, and turning towards the sea, we come to the noted seaport
of Hull, or, as it is best known in those parts, Kingston-upon-Hull. While not possessing great
attractions for the ordinary tourist, yet Hull ranks as the third seaport of England, being
second only to London and Liverpool. It is the great packet-station for the north of Europe,
with steam lines leading to Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Russia, and the Baltic, most
of the English trade with those countries being centred at Hull. It is a town of extreme activity,
its docks being all the time crowded with shipping, and its location, practically upon an island,
with the river Humber on the south, the river Hull upon the east, and docks upon the northern
and western sides, giving it every maritime convenience. The docks, though inferior to those
of Liverpool, are the chief feature of the town. The Hull River itself forms a natural dock
about a mile and a half long, and from this a chain of other docks leads through the warehouses
and the town to the Humber. Hull possesses the Trinity House, one of the three ancient establishments
in England--the others being at London and Newcastle--which were founded first as a religious
fraternity in the fourteenth century, and became afterwards establishments for the relief of
distressed and decayed seamen and their families. The present Trinity House building was erected
in the last century. The chief ornament of Hull is the Wilberforce Monument, a pillar of sandstone
seventy-two feet high, erected about a half century ago, and surmounted by a statue of the
celebrated philanthropist. He was born on High Street August 24, 1759, this being the most
important thoroughfare in ancient Hull, but now a narrow and inconvenient lane following the
right bank of the Hull River. Here were in former days the houses of the great Hull merchants,
and the Wilberforce House is about halfway down the street. It is a curious specimen of brickwork,
of a style said to have been imported from Flanders in the reign of William and Mary. It is
a low, broad house with a surmounting tower over the doorway. Hull has little else of interest
in the way of buildings. Its Holy Trinity Church, in the market-place, is the largest parish
church in England, having recently been thoroughly restored, and the Town Hall, built in the
Italian style, with a clock-tower, is its finest edifice of modern construction.

We have now come into Yorkshire, and a few minutes' ride northward by railway along the valley
of the Hull River brings the visitor to Beverley, an old-fashioned Yorkshire town of considerable
antiquity, eight miles from the seaport. This was anciently a walled town, but of the entrance-gates
only one survives, the North Bar, of the time of Edward III. It is a good specimen of brick
architecture, with mouldings and niches upon the surface and battlements at the top. This is
a favorite old town for the retired merchant and tradesman who wish to pass the declining years
of life in quiet, and it contains many ancient buildings of interest. Several of these are
clustered around the picturesque market-square, which is an enclosure of about four acres,
and contains a quaint cross, a relic of the time when it was customary to build market-crosses.
These ancient crosses, which were practically canopies erected over a raised platform, were
generally used as pulpits by the preachers when conducting religious services in the open air.
Sometimes they were memorials of the dead. We are told that there were formerly five thousand
of these crosses of various kinds in England, but most of them were destroyed in the Civil
Wars. At these old crosses proclamations used to be read and tolls collected from the market-people.
The covered market-cross at Beverley was one of the last that was erected. The name of this
interesting town is said to be derived from Beaver Lake, the site having at one time been surrounded
by lakes that were formed by the overflowing of the Humber, in which beavers lived in great
numbers. The Beverley Minster is an attractive Gothic church, and from the tops of its towers
there is an excellent view over the rich and almost level valley through which the Hull River
flows. Leconfield Castle, in the suburbs, was an ancient residence of the Percys, of which
the moat alone remains.

SHEFFIELD.

Let us now ascend the estuary of the Humber, and, proceeding up its numerous tributaries, seek
out various places of interest in the West Riding of Yorkshire. And first, ascending the river
Don, we come to that great manufacturing centre of the "Black Country," sacred to coal and
iron, Sheffield. Murray's Guide tells us that while Sheffield is one of the largest and most
important towns in Yorkshire, it is "beyond all question the blackest, dirtiest, and least
respectable." Horace Walpole in the last century wrote that Sheffield is "one of the foulest
towns in England in the most charming situation." It is a crowded city, with narrow and badly-arranged
streets, having few handsome public buildings, but bristling with countless tall chimneys belching
forth clouds of heavy smoke that hang like a pall over the place. The Don and its tributaries
have their beds defiled, and altogether the smoky city is in unpleasant contrast with the beauty
of the surrounding country. But, unfortunately, an omelette cannot be made without breaking
eggs, nor can Sheffield make cutlery without smoke and bad odors, all of which have amazingly
multiplied within the present century, its population having grown from forty-five thousand
in 1801 to over three hundred thousand now. It stands at the confluence of the rivers Don and
Sheaf, its name being connected with the latter. Three smaller streams join them within the
city and are utilized for water-power. The factories spread over the lowlands of the Don valley,
and mount up its western slopes towards the moorlands that stretch away to Derbyshire; it is
therefore as hilly as it is grimy. Sheffield at the time of the Norman Conquest was the manor
of Hallam, which has passed through various families, until, in the seventeenth century, it
became by marriage the property of the Duke of Norfolk. The present duke is lord of the manor
of Sheffield, and derives a large income from his vast estates there. Sheffield Castle once
stood at the confluence of the two rivers, but all traces of it have disappeared. The manor-house,
which has been restored, dates from the time of Henry VIII. It is three stories high, and a
turret staircase leads from floor to floor, and finally out upon the flat roof.

We are told that Sheffield manufactures of metals began in the days of the Romans, and also
that Sheffield-made arrows fell thickly at Crecy and Agincourt. Richmond used them with effect
at Bosworth Field, and in the sixteenth century we read of Sheffield knives and whittles. Almost
the only ancient building of any note the city has is the parish church, but it is so much
patched and altered that there is difficulty in distinguishing the newer from the older parts.
The chief among the modern buildings is the Cutlers' Hall, a Grecian structure erected for
the Cutlers Company in 1833, and enlarged a few years ago by the addition of a handsome apartment.
This company, the autocrats of Sheffield, was founded in 1624 by act of Parliament with two
express objects--to keep a check upon the number of apprentices and to examine into the quality
of Sheffield wares, all of which were to be stamped with the warranty of their excellence.
But recently the restrictive powers of this company have been swept away, and it is now little
more than a grantor of trade-marks and an excuse for an annual banquet. Sheffield has extensive
markets and parks, and the Duke of Norfolk is conspicuous in his gifts of this character to
the city; but overtopping all else are the enormous works, which make everything into which
iron and steel can be converted, from armor-plating and railway-rails down to the most delicate
springs and highly-tempered cutlery. Their products go to every part of the world, and are
of enormous value and importance.

WAKEFIELD.

Upon the Calder, another tributary of the Humber, northward of the Don, is the town of Wakefield,
which, until the recent great growth of Leeds, was the head-quarters of the Yorkshire clothing-trade.
It was here that in the Wars of the Roses the battle of Wakefield was fought on the closing
day of the year 1460. The Duke of York wished to remain at Wakefield on the defensive against
Queen Margaret's Lancastrian army of twenty thousand men, for his forces were barely one-fourth
that number. The Earl of Salisbury, however, prevailed on him to advance to meet the queen,
and he probably had no idea of the strength she had to oppose him. The duke was soon cut off,
and was among the first to fall, his head having afterwards been put on the Micklegate bar
at York. Scenes of great barbarity followed: the Duke of York's son, the Earl of Rutland, was
murdered with shocking cruelty after the battle on Wakefield Bridge. Young Rutland's brother,
afterwards Edward IV., erected a chapel on the bridge on the spot where he was slain, in order
that prayer might be constantly said in it for the repose of the souls of the followers of
the White Rose who were slain in the battle. It covers thirty by twenty-four feet, and has
recently been restored by a successor of Goldsmith's "Vicar of Wakefield." Near the bridge
the spot is pointed out where the Duke of York was killed, now marked by two willows. There
is a fine old three-gabled house in Wakefield which was built about the same date as the battle
was fought, and is now divided into small shops. It is a good specimen of the ancient black-and-white
timbered house, though the carved work on the front has been considerably defaced. It stands
in the Kirkgate, which runs down to the Calder, and is known locally as the "Six Chimblies."

LEEDS.

About nine miles north of Wakefield is the great commercial capital of Yorkshire and centre
of the cloth-trade. Leeds, built in the valley of the river Aire. Twelve hundred years ago
this region, embracing the valleys of the Aire and the Calder, was the independent kingdom
of Loidis. It was soon overrun and conquered, however, by the Anglian hosts, and ultimately
the conquerors built here the monastery that in Bede's time was presided over by the abbot
Thrydwulf. This stood on the site of the present parish church, and in the eighth century it
was called "the monastery at Leeta." It stood at the crossing of two important Roman roads
in the midst of a forest. This was the beginning of the great city, for soon a hamlet gathered
around the monastery, though long since the woods, and indeed all green things, were driven
away from Leeds. The village was laid waste by William the Conqueror, and at the time of the
Domesday Book it was one of one hundred and fifty manors held by Baron Ilbert de Lacy, whose
possessions stretched halfway across Yorkshire. He built a castle at Leeds, which was afterwards
a prison of Richard II., but has long since disappeared. In 1530, Leland described Leeds as
"a pretty market-town, as large as Bradford, but not so quick as it." Charles I. incorporated
it, and the cloth-market was then of some importance. In the Civil War it was taken by the
Royalists, and afterwards retaken by Fairfax for the Parliament in a short, sharp struggle,
in which a clergyman named Scholfield distinguished himself by his valor, and "by his triumphant
psalm-singing" as work after work was captured from the enemy. Flemish workmen brought cloth-making
into this part of Yorkshire as early as the reign of Edward III., and two centuries ago the
cloth-makers prospered so much that they held a market twice a week at Leeds on a long, narrow
bridge crossing the Aire. They laid their cloth on the battlements of the bridge and on benches
below, and the country clothiers could buy for four cents from the innkeepers "a pot of ale,
a noggin of porridge, and a trencher of boiled or roast beef." This substantial supply was
known as the "brigg (bridge)-shot," and from the bridge ran the street known as the Briggate,
which has since developed into one of the finest avenues of the city.

Leeds began to grow in the last century, when it became the chief mart of the woollen clothiers,
while the worsted-trade gathered about Bradford. These still remain the centres of the two
great divisions of the woollen industry, which is the characteristic business of Yorkshire.
The factories began then to appear at Leeds, and in the present century the city has made astonishing
advances, growing from fifty-three thousand population in 1801 until it exceeds three hundred
thousand now. The great cloth-mart to-day is for miles a region of tall chimneys and barrack-like
edifices, within which steadily roars machinery that represents some of the most ingenious
skill of the human race. Within this hive of busy industry there still linger some memorials
of the past among its hundreds of cloth-mills. Turning out of the broad Briggate into the quiet
street of St. John, we come to the church built there by the piety of the wealthy clothier
John Harrison, and consecrated in 1634. St. John's Church, which he built and presented to
the town because the older parish church could scarce hold half the inhabitants, consists of
a long nave and chancel, with a south aisle. It is of Gothic architecture, and much of the
ancient woodwork, including the pulpit, remains. Arabesques moulded in white plaster fill the
panels between the main roof-beams. This interesting church has undergone little historical
change excepting the recent rebuilding of the tower. John Harrison is entombed in the church.
The old parish church in Kirkgate has been within a few years entirely rebuilt. The other churches
of Leeds, like this one, are all modern, and it also has an imposing Town Hall, opened by the
queen in 1858, in which are held the annual musical festivals, which have attained much importance.
A statue of the Duke of Wellington stands in the open square in front. The two Cloth Halls
of Leeds, the Mixed Cloth Hall and the White Cloth Hall, where the business of selling was
at first carried on, are now little used, the trade being conducted directly between the manufacturer
and the clothier. Some of the mills are of enormous size, and they include every operation
from the raw material to the finished fabric. But, with all their ingenious machinery, the
cloth-weavers have not yet been able to supersede the use of the teasel, by which the loose
fibres of wool are raised to the surface to form, when cut and sheared, the pile or nap. These
teasels, which are largely grown in Yorkshire, are fastened into a cylinder, and at least three
thousand of them will be consumed in "teasling" a piece of cloth forty yards long.

BOLTON ABBEY.

North of the valley of the Aire is the valley of the Wharfe River, and, following that pleasant
stream a short distance up, we come to Rumbald's Moor and the water-cure establishments of
the town of Ilkley, which is an array of villas and terraces spreading up the hillside from
the southern bank of the river. The neighborhood is full of attractive rock-and river-scenery.
In the suburbs is the palace of Ben Rhydding, built in the Scottish baronial style, with the
Cow and Calf Rocks overhanging the adjacent park. The Panorama Rock also commands a wide prospect,
while Rumbald's Moor itself is elevated over thirteen hundred feet. A few miles from Ilkley
are the celebrated ruins of Bolton Abbey, standing on a patch of open ground, around which
the Wharfe curves, but with much woods clustering near the ruins and on the river-bank. Bolton
stands in a deep valley, and on the opposite side of the river rises the steep rock of Simon's
Seat, sixteen hundred feet high. The architecture of the abbey is of various styles, the west
front coming down to us from the reign of Henry VIII., while its gateway is much older. There
is no south aisle to the abbey, and at present the nave and north aisle are roofed in and serve
as the parish church. The east end of this aisle is divided from the rest by an ancient wooden
screen so as to form a chapel, and beneath this is the vault where the former owners of Bolton--the
Claphams and Mauleverers--were buried. Some years ago, when the floor was being repaired, their
coffins were found standing upright, whereof the poet tells us:

  "Through the chinks in the fractured floor
    Look down and see a grisly sight--
    A vault where the bodies are buried upright
  There, face by face and hand by hand.
  The Claphams and Mauleverers stand."

The ruins of the north transept are in fair preservation, and the choir has a beautiful arcade,
while through the openings beneath there is a charming view of the green-bordered river and
of the hills beyond. Bolton Hall, which was the ancient gateway of the abbey, is opposite its
western front, and is one of the favorite homes in the shooting season of the Duke of Devonshire,
its owner.

A pleasant walk of two miles along the Wharfe brings us to the famous Strid, where the river
is hemmed in between ledges of rock, and the scene of the rushing waters is very fine, especially
after a rain. Beautiful paths wind along the hillsides and through the woods, and here, where
the ruins of Bardon Tower rise high above the valley, is a favorite resort of artists. At the
most contracted part of the rocky river-passage the water rushes through a narrow trench cut
out for about sixty yards length, within which distance it falls ten feet. The noise here is
almost deafening, and at the narrowest part the distance across is barely five feet. It looks
easy to jump over, but from the peculiar position of the slippery rocks and the confusing noise
of the rushing water it is a dangerous leap.

  "This striding-place is called 'the Strid.'
    A name which it took of yore.
  A thousand years hath it borne that name,
    And shall a thousand more."

It was here that young Romilly, the "Boy of Egremont," was drowned several centuries ago, the
story of his death being told by Wordsworth in his poem of "The Force of Prayer." He had been
ranging through Bardon Wood, holding a greyhound in a leash, and tried to leap across the Strid:

  "He sprang in glee; for what cared he,
    That the river was strong and the rocks were steep?
  But the greyhound in the leash hung back,
    And checked him in his leap.

  "The boy is in the arms of Wharfe,
    And strangled by a merciless force;
  For nevermore was young Romilly seen
    Till he rose a lifeless corse."

It is said that his disconsolate mother built Bolton Abbey to commemorate the death of her
only son, and placed it in one of the most picturesque spots in England.

RIPON AND FOUNTAINS.

Proceeding still farther northward from the charming vale of Wharfe, we come to the valley
of the Ure, which flows into the Ouse, a main tributary of the Humber, and to the famous cathedral-town
of Ripon. This is a place of venerable antiquity, for it has been over twelve centuries since
a band of Scotch monks came from Melrose to establish a monastery on the sloping headland above
the Ure. A portion of the ancient church then founded is incorporated in the present Ripon
Minster, which was built seven centuries ago. It was burned and partly injured by the Scotch
in the fourteenth century, and subsequently the central tower and greater part of the nave
were rebuilt. It has recently been entirely restored. The cathedral consists of a nave, with
aisles extending the full width of the western front, and rather broad for its length; the
transepts are short. Parallel to the choir on the southern side is a chapter-house. It is one
of the smallest cathedrals in England, being less than two hundred and ninety feet long, and
other buildings so encompass it as to prevent a good near view. There is an ample churchyard,
but the shrine of St. Wilfrid, the founder, whose relics were the great treasure of the church,
has long since disappeared. It appears that in ancient times there was great quarrelling over
the possession of his bones, and that Archbishop Odo, declaring his grave to be neglected,
carried them off to Canterbury, but after much disputing a small portion of the saint's remains
were restored to Ripon. Beneath the corner of the nave is the singular crypt known as Wilfrid's
Needle. A long passage leads to a cell from which a narrow window opens into another passage.
Through this window we are told that women whose virtue was doubted were made to crawl, and
if they stuck by the way were adjudged guilty. This is the oldest part of the church, and is
regarded as the most perfect existing relic of the earliest age of Christianity in Yorkshire.
The cathedral contains some interesting monuments, one of which demonstrates that epitaph-writing
flourished in times agone at Ripon. It commemorates, as "a faint emblem of his refined taste,"
William Weddell of Newby, "in whom every virtue that ennobles the human mind was united with
every elegance that adorns it."

In the neighborhood of Ripon is the world-renowned Fountains Abbey, of which the remains are
in excellent preservation, and stand in a beautiful situation on the verge of the fine estate
of the Marquis of Ripon, Studley Royal. The gates of this park are about two miles from Ripon,
the road winding among the trees, beneath which herds of deer are browsing, and leading up
to the mansion, in front of which is an attractive scene. The little river Skell, on its way
to the Ure, emerges from a glen, and is banked up to form a lake, from which it tumbles over
a pretty cascade. The steep bank opposite is covered with trees. John Aislabie, who had been
chancellor of the exchequer, laid out this park in 1720, and such repute did his ornamental
works attain that Studley was regarded as the most embellished spot in the North of England.
Ultimately, through heiresses, it passed into the hands of the present owner. The pleasure-grounds
were laid out in the Dutch style then in vogue, and the slopes of the valley were terraced,
planted with evergreens, and adorned with statues. Modern landscape-gardening has somewhat
varied the details, but the original design remains. In the gardens are the Octagon Tower,
perched upon a commanding knoll, the Temple of Piety, near the water-side, and an arbor known
as Anne Boleyn's Seat, which commands a superb view over Fountains Dale. Let us enter this
pretty glen, which gradually narrows, becomes more abrupt and rocky, and as we go along the
Skell leads us from the woods out upon a level grassy meadow, at the end of which stand the
gray ruins of the famous Cistercian abbey. The buildings spread completely across the glen
to its craggy sides on either hand. On the right there is only room for a road to pass between
the transept and the limestone rock which rears on high the trees rooted in its crannies, whose
branches almost brush the abbey's stately tower. On the other side is the little river, with
the conventual buildings carried across it in more than one place, the water flowing through
a vaulted tunnel. These buildings extend to the bases of the opposite crags. The ruins are
of great size, and it does not take much imagination to restore the glen to its aspect when
the abbey was in full glory seven or eight hundred years ago. Its founders came hither almost
as exiles from York, and began building the abbey in the twelfth century, but it was barely
completed when Henry VIII. forced the dissolution of the monasteries. It was very rich, and
furnished rare plunder when the monks were compelled to leave it. The close or immediate grounds
of the abbey contained about eighty acres, entered by a gate-house to the westward of the church,
the ruins of which can still be seen. Near by is an old mill alongside the Skell, and a picturesque
bridge crosses the stream, while on a neighboring knoll are some ancient yews which are believed
to have sheltered the earliest settlers, and are called the "Seven Sisters." But, unfortunately,
only two now remain, gnarled and twisted, with decaying trunks and falling limbs--ruins in
fact that are as venerable as Fountains Abbey itself. Botanists say they are twelve hundred
years old, and that they were full-grown trees when the exiles from York first encamped alongside
the Skell.

Entering the close, the ruins of the abbey church are seen in better preservation than the
other buildings. The roof is gone, for its woodwork was used to melt down the lead by zealous
Reformers in the sixteenth century, and green grass has replaced the pavement. The ruins disclose
a noble temple, the tower rising one hundred and sixty-eight feet. In the eastern transept
is the beautiful "Chapel of the Nine Altars" with its tall and slender columns, some of the
clustering shafts having fallen. For some distance southward and eastward from the church extend
the ruins of the other convent-buildings. In former times they were used as a stone-quarry
for the neighborhood, many of the walls being levelled to the ground, but since the last century
they have been scrupulously preserved. The plan is readily traced, for excavations have been
made to better display the ruins. South of the nave of the church was the cloister-court. On
one side was the transept and chapter-house, and on the other a long corridor supporting the
dormitory. This was one hundred yards long, extending across the river, and abutting against
the crags on the other side. South of the cloister-court was the refectory and other apartments.
To the eastward was a group of buildings terminating in a grand house for the abbot, which
also bridged the river. All these are now in picturesque ruin, the long corridor, with its
vaulted roof supported by a central row of columns with broad arches, being considered one
of the most impressive religious remains in England. One of the chief uses to which the Fountains
Abbey stone-quarry was devoted was the building, in the reign of James I., of a fine Jacobean
mansion as the residence for its then owner, Sir Stephen Proctor. This is Fountains Hall, an
elaborate structure of that period which stands near the abbey gateway, and to a great extent
atones, by its quaint attractiveness, for the vandalism that despoiled the abbey to furnish
materials for its construction. In fact, the mournful reflection is always uppermost in viewing
the remains of this famous place that it would have been a grand old ruin could it have been
preserved, but the spoilers who plundered it for their own profit are said to have discovered,
in the fleeting character of the riches thus obtained, that ill-gotten gains never prosper.

RICHMOND CASTLE.

Proceeding northward from Ripon, and crossing over into the valley of the river Swale, we reach
one of the most picturesquely located towns of England--Richmond, whose great castle is among
the best English remains of the Norman era. The river flows over a broken and rocky bed around
the base of a cliff, and crowning the precipice above is the great castle, magnificent even
in decay. It was founded in the reign of William the Conqueror by Alan the Red, who was created
Earl of Richmond, and it covers a space of about five acres on a rock projecting over the river,
the prominent tower of the venerable keep being surrounded by walls and buildings. A lane leads
up from the market-place of the town to the castle-gate, alongside of which are Robin Hood's
Tower and the Golden Tower, the latter named from a tradition of a treasure being once found
there. The Scolland's Hall, a fine specimen of Norman work, adjoins this tower. The keep is
one hundred feet high and furnished with walls eleven feet thick, time having had little effect
upon its noble structure, one of the most perfect Norman keep-towers remaining in England.
There is a grand view from the battlements over the romantic valley of the Swale. In the village
is an old gray tower, the only remains of a Franciscan monastery founded in the thirteenth
century, and the ruins of Easby Abbey, dating from the twelfth century, are not far away; its
granary is still in use. The valley of the Swale may be pursued for a long distance, furnishing
constant displays of romantic scenery, or, if that is preferred, excellent trout-fishing.

YORK.

From the high hills in the neighborhood of Fountains Dale there is a magnificent view over
the plain of York, and we will now proceed down the valley of the Ouse to the venerable city
that the Romans called Eboracum, and which is the capital of a county exceeding in extent many
kingdoms and principalities of Europe. This ancient British stronghold has given its name to
the metropolis of the New World, but the modern Babylon on the Hudson has far outstripped the
little city on the equally diminutive Ouse. It was Ebrane, the king of the Brigantes, who is
said to have founded York, but so long ago that he is believed a myth. Whatever its origin,
a settlement was there before the Christian era, but nothing certain is known of it beyond
the fact that it existed when the Romans invaded Britain and captured York, with other strongholds,
in the first century of the Christian era. Eboracum was made the head-quarters of their fifth
legion, and soon became the chief city of a district now rich in the relics of the Roman occupation,
their dead being still found thickly buried around the town. Portions of the walls of Eboracum
remain, among them being that remarkable relic, the tower, polygonal in plan, which is known
as the Multangular Tower, and which marks the south-western angle of the ancient Roman city.
Not far away are the dilapidated ruins of St. Mary's Abbey, once one of the wealthiest and
proudest religious houses in the North of England, but with little now left but portions of
the foundations, a gateway, and the north and west walls of the nave. This abbey was founded
in the eleventh century, and it was from here that the exiled monks who built Fountains Abbey
were driven out. This ruin has been in its present condition for nearly two hundred and fifty
years.

For over three centuries Eboracum was a great Roman city. Here came the emperor Severus and
died in 211, his body being cremated and the ashes conveyed to Rome. When the empire was divided,
Britain fell to the share of Constantius Chlorus, and he made Eboracum his home, dying there
in 305. Constantine the Great, his son, was first proclaimed emperor at Eboracum. When the
Romans departed evil days fell upon York; the barbarians destroyed it, and it was not till
627 that it reappeared in history, when Eadwine, King of Northumbria, was baptized there by
St. Paulinus on Easter Day, a little wooden church being built for the purpose. Then began
its ecclesiastical eminence, for Paulinus was the first Archbishop of York, beginning a line
of prelates that has continued unbroken since. In the eighth century the Northmen began their
incursions, and from spoilers ultimately became settlers. York prospered, being thronged with
Danish merchants, and in the tenth century had thirty thousand population. In King Harold's
reign the Northmen attacked and captured the town, when Harold surprised and defeated them,
killing their leader Tostig, but no sooner had he won the victory than he had to hasten southward
to meet William the Norman, and be in turn vanquished and slain. York resisted William, but
he ultimately conquered the city and built a castle there, but being rebellious the people
attacked the castle. He returned and chastised them and built a second castle on the Ouse;
but the discontent deepened, and a Danish fleet appearing in the Humber there was another rebellion,
and the Norman garrison firing the houses around the castle to clear the ground for its better
defence, the greater part of the city was consumed. While this was going on the Danes arrived,
attacked and captured both castles, slaughtered their entire garrisons of three thousand men,
and were practically unopposed by the discontented people. Then it was that the stalwart Norman
William swore "by the splendor of God" to avenge himself on Northumbria, and, keeping his pledge,
he devastated the entire country north of the Humber.

York continued to exist without making much history for several centuries, till the Wars of
the Roses came between the rival houses of York and Lancaster. In this York bore its full part,
but it was at first the Lancastrian king who was most frequently found at York, and not the
duke who bore the title. But after Towton Field, on Palm Sunday, March 29, 1461, the most sanguinary
battle ever fought in England, one hundred thousand men being engaged, the news of their defeat
was brought to the Lancastrian king Henry and Queen Margaret at York, and they soon became
fugitives, and their youthful adversary, the Duke of York, was crowned Edward IV. in York Minster.
In the Civil War it was in York that Charles I. took refuge, and from that city issued his
first declaration of war against the Parliament. For two years York was loyal to the king,
and then the fierce siege took place in which the Parliamentary forces ruined St. Mary's Abbey
by undermining and destroying its tower. Prince Rupert raised this siege, but the respite was
not long. Marston Moor saw the king defeated, Rupert's troopers being, as the historian tells
us, made as "stubble to the swords of Cromwell's Ironsides." The king's shattered army retreated
to York, was pursued, and in a fortnight York surrendered to the Parliamentary forces. The
city languished afterwards, losing its trade, and developing vast pride, but equal poverty.
Since the days of railways, however, it has become a very important junction, and has thus
somewhat revived its activity.

The walls of York are almost as complete as those of Chester, while its ancient gateways are
in much better preservation. The gateways, called "bars," are among the marked features of
the city, and the streets leading to them are called "gates." The chief of these is Micklegate,
the highroad leading to the south, the most important street in York, and Micklegate Bar is
the most graceful in design of all, coming down from Tudor days, with turrets and battlements
pierced with cross-shaped loopholes and surmounted by small stone figures of warriors. It was
on this bar that the head of the Duke of York was exposed, and the ghastly spectacle greeted
his son, Edward IV., as he rode into the town after Towton Field. It did not take long to strike
off the heads of several distinguished prisoners and put them in his place as an expiatory
offering. Here also whitened the heads of traitors down to as late as the last Jacobite rebellion.
One of the buttresses of the walls of York is the Red Tower, so called from the red brick of
which it is built. These walls and gates are full of interesting relics of the olden time,
and they are still preserved to show the line of circumvallation of the ancient walled city.
But the chief glory of York is its famous minster, on which the hand of time has been lightly
laid. When King Eadwine was baptized in the little wooden church hastily erected for the purpose,
he began building at the same place, at the suggestion of Paulinus, a large and more noble
basilica of stone, wherein the little church was to be included. But before it was completed
the king was slain, and his head was brought to York and buried in the portico of the basilica.
This church fell into decay, and was burned in the eighth century. On its site was built a
much larger minster, which was consumed in William the Conqueror's time, when the greater part
of York was burned. From its ashes rose the present magnificent minster, portions of which
were building from the eleventh to the fifteenth century, it being completed as we now see
it in 1470, and reconsecrated as the cathedral of St. Peter with great pomp in 1472. Its chief
treasure, was the shrine of St. William, the nephew of King Stephen, a holy man of singularly
gentle character. When he came into York it is said the pressure of the crowd was so great
that it caused the fall of a bridge over the Ouse, but the saint by a miracle saved all their
lives. The shrine was destroyed at the Reformation, and the relics buried in the nave, where
they were found in the last century. York Minster remained almost unchanged until 1829, when
a lunatic named Martin concealed himself one night in the cathedral and set fire to the woodwork
of the choir, afterwards escaping through a transept-window. The fire destroyed the timber
roofs of the choir and nave and the great organ. Martin was arrested, and confined in an asylum
until he died. The restoration cost $350,000, and had not long been completed when some workmen
accidentally set fire to the south-western tower, which gutted it, destroyed the bells, and
burned the roof of the nave. This mischief cost $125,000 to repair, and the southern transept,
which was considered unsafe, has since been partially rebuilt.

Few English cathedrals exceed York Minster in dignity and massive grandeur. It is the largest
Gothic church in the kingdom, and contains one of the biggest bells. "Old Peter," weighing
ten and three-quarter tons, and struck regularly every day at noon. The minster is five hundred
and twenty-four feet long, two hundred and twenty-two feet wide, ninety-nine feet high in the
nave, and its towers rise about two hundred feet, the central tower being two hundred and twelve
feet high. Its great charms are its windows, most of them containing the original stained glass,
some of it nearly six hundred years old. The east window is the largest stained-glass window
in the world, seventy-seven by thirty-two feet, and of exquisite design, being made by John
Thornton of Coventry in 1408, who was paid one dollar per week wages and got a present of fifty
dollars when he finished it. At the end of one transept is the Five Sisters Window, designed
by five nuns, each planning a tall, narrow sash; and a beautiful rose-window is at the end
of the other transept. High up in the nave the statue of St. George stands on one side defying
the dragon, who pokes out his head on the other. Its tombs are among the minster's greatest
curiosities. The effigy of Archbishop Walter de Grey, nearly six hundred and fifty years old,
is stretched out in an open coffin lying under a superb canopy, and the corpse instead of being
in the ground is overhead in the canopy. All the walls are full of memorial tablets--a few
modern ones to English soldiers, but most of them ancient. Strange tombs are also set in the
walls, bearing effigies of the dead. Sir William Gee stands up with his two wives, one on each
side, and his six children--all eight statues having their hands folded. Others sit up like
Punch and Judy, the women dressed in hoops, farthingales, and ruffs, the highest fashions of
their age. Here is buried Wentworth, second Earl of Strafford, and scores of archbishops. The
body of the famous Hotspur is entombed in the wall beneath the great east window. Burke's friend
Saville is buried here, that statesman having written his epitaph. The outside of the minster
has all sorts of grotesque protuberances, which, according to the ancient style of church-building,
represent the evil spirits that religion casts out. Adjoining the north transept, and approached
through a beautiful vestibule, is the chapter-house, an octagonal building sixty-three feet
in diameter and surmounted by a pyramidal roof. Seven of its sides are large stained-glass
windows, and the ceiling is a magnificent work.

York Castle occupied a peninsula between the Ouse and a branch called the Foss. Of this Clifford's
Tower is about all of the ancient work that remains. It rises on its mound high above the surrounding
buildings, and was the keep of the ancient fortress, constructed according to a remarkable
and unique plan, consisting of parts of four cylinders running into each other. It dates from
Edward I., but the entrance was built by Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, its governor under Charles
I. The interior of the tower was afterwards burned, and George Fox, the founder of the Society
of Friends, who was imprisoned there, planted a walnut tree within the tower which is still
growing. It was in the keep of the Norman castle, which this tower replaced, that the massacre
of the Jews, which grew out of race-jealousy at their great wealth, occurred in 1190. On March
16th the house of Benet, the leading Jew in York, was sacked by a mob and his wife and children
murdered. Five hundred of his countrymen then sought refuge in the castle, and those who remained
outside were killed. The mob besieged the castle, led by a hermit from the neighborhood "famed
for zeal and holiness," who was clothed in white robes, and each morning celebrated mass and
inflamed the fury of the besiegers by his preaching. At last he ventured too near the walls,
and was brained by a stone. Battering-rams were then brought up, and a night's carouse was
indulged in before the work of knocking down the castle began. Within was a different scene:
the Jews were without food or hope. An aged rabbi, who had come as a missionary from the East,
and was venerated almost as a prophet, exhorted his brethren to render up freely their lives
to God rather than await death at the enemy's hands. Nearly all decided to follow his counsel;
they fired the castle, destroyed their property, killed their wives and children, and then
turned their swords upon themselves. Day broke, and the small remnant who dared not die called
from the walls of the blazing castle that they were anxious for baptism and "the faith and
peace of Christ." They were promised everything, opened the gates, and were all massacred.
In later years York Castle has enclosed some well-known prisoners, among them Eugene Aram,
and Dick Turpin, who was hanged there. The York elections and mass-meetings are held in the
courtyard.

Here Wilberforce, who long represented York in Parliament, spoke in 1784, when Boswell wrote
of him: "I saw what seemed a mere shrimp mount upon the table, but as I listened he grew and
grew until the shrimp became a whale." The York streets are full of old houses, many with porches
and overhanging fronts. One of the most curious rows is the Shambles, on a narrow street and
dating from the fourteenth century. A little way out of town is the village of Holgate, which
was the residence of Lindley Murray the grammarian. Guy Fawkes is said to have been a native
of York, and this strange and antique old city, we are also credibly assured, was in 1632 the
birthplace of Robinson Crusoe.

CASTLE HOWARD.

Starting north-east from York towards the coast, we go along the pretty valley of the Derwent,
and not far from the borders of the stream come to that magnificent pile, the seat of the Earls
of Carlisle--Castle Howard. More than a century ago Walpole wrote of it: "Lord Strafford had
told me that I should see one of the finest places in Yorkshire, but nobody had informed me
that I should at one view see a palace, a town, a fortified city: temples on high places; woods
worthy of being each a metropolis of the Druids; vales connected to hills by other woods; the
noblest lawn in the world, fenced by half the horizon; and a mausoleum that would tempt one
to be buried alive. In short, I have seen gigantic places before, but never a sublimer one."
Castle Howard was the work of Vanbrugh, the designer of Blenheim, and in plan is somewhat similar,
but much more sober and simple, with a central cupola that gives it dignity. It avoids many
of the faults of Blenheim: its wings are more subdued, so that the central colonnade stands
out to greater advantage, and there are few more imposing country-houses in England than this
palace of the Howards. This family are scions of the ducal house of Norfolk, so that "all the
blood of all the Howards," esteemed the bluest blood in the kingdom, runs in their veins. The
Earls of Carlisle are descended from "Belted Will"--Lord William Howard, the lord warden of
the Marches in the days of the first Stuart--whose stronghold was at Naworth Castle, twelve
miles north-east of Carlisle. His grandson took an active part in the restoration of Charles
II., and in recompense was created the first Earl of Carlisle. His bones lie in York Minster.
His grandson, the third earl, who was deputy earl-marshal at the coronation of Queen Anne,
built Castle Howard. The seventh earl, George William Frederick, was for eight years viceroy
in Ireland, resigning in 1864 on account of ill-health; and it is said that he was one of the
few English rulers who really won the affections of the people of that unhappy country. He
died soon afterwards.

Leaving the railway-station in the valley of the Derwent, and mounting the hills to the westward,
a little village is reached on the confines of the park. Beyond the village the road to the
park-gates passes through meadow-land, and is bordered by beautiful beech trees arranged in
clusters of about a dozen trees in each, producing an unusual but most happy effect. The gateway
is entered, a plain building in a castellated wall--this being Walpole's "fortified city"--and,
proceeding up a slope, the fine avenue of beeches crosses another avenue of lime trees. Here
is placed an obelisk erected in honor of John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, which also bears
an inscription telling of the erection of Castle Howard. It recites that the house was built
on the site of the old castle of Hinderskelf, and was begun in 1702 by Charles, the third Earl
of Carlisle, who set up this inscription in 1731. The happy earl, pleased with the grand palace
and park he had created, thus addresses posterity on the obelisk:

  "If to perfection these plantations rise,
  If they agreeably my heirs surprise,
  This faithful pillar will their age declare
  As long as time these characters shall spare.
  Here, then, with kind remembrance read his name
  Who for posterity performed the same."

The avenue then leads on past the north front of the castle, standing in a fine situation upon
a ridge between two shallow valleys. The bed of the northern valley has been converted into
a lake, while on the southern slopes are beautiful and extensive lawns and gardens. The house
forms three sides of a hollow square, and within, it is interesting in pictures and ornaments.
It is cut up, however, into small rooms and long, chilly corridors, which detract from its
good effect. The entrance-hall is beneath the central dome and occupies the whole height of
the structure, but it is only about thirty-five feet square, giving a sense of smallness. Frescoes
decorate the walls and ceilings. The public apartments, which are in several suites opening
into each other and flanked by long corridors, are like a museum, so full are they of rare
works of art, china, glass, and paintings. Much of the collection came from the Orleans Gallery.
There are also many portraits in black and red chalk by Janet, a French artist who flourished
in the sixteenth century. Some of the paintings are of great value, and are by Rubens, Caracci,
Canaletti, Tintoretto, Titian, Hogarth, Bellini, Mabuse, Holbein, Lely, Vandyke, Reynolds,
Gainsborough, and others. The Castle Howard collection is exceptionally valuable in historical
portraits. The windows of the drawing-room look out upon extensive flower-gardens, laid out
in rather formal style with antique vases and statues. Beyond these gardens is seen a circular
temple placed upon a knoll, the "mausoleum" which so moved Walpole. Here the former owners
of the castle are buried, a constant memento mori to the tenants of the house, though the taste
certainly seems peculiar that has made the family tomb the most prominent object in the view
from the drawing-room windows.

Not far from Castle Howard are the ruins of Kirkham Priory. A charming fragment of this noble
church remains in a grassy valley on the margin of the Derwent. Here, nearly eight hundred
years ago, the Augustinians established the priory, the founder being Sir Walter l'Espec, one
of the leaders of the English who drove back King David's Scottish invasion at the battle of
the Standard, near Durham. Sir Walter had an only son, who was one day riding near the site
of Kirkham when a wild boar suddenly rushed across his path. The horse plunged and threw his
rider, who, striking head-foremost against a projecting stone, was killed. Sir Walter, being
childless, determined to devote his wealth to the service of God, and founded three religious
houses--one in Bedfordshire, another at Rievaulx, where he sought refuge from his sorrows,
and the third at the place of his son's death at Kirkham. Legend says that the youth was caught
by his foot in the stirrup when thrown, and was dragged by his runaway horse to the spot where
the high altar was afterwards located. Sir Walter's sister married into the family of De Ros,
among the ancestors of the Dukes of Rutland, and they were patrons of Kirkham until the dissolution
of the monasteries. Little remains of it: the gate-house still stands, and in front is the
base of a cross said to have been made from the stone against which the boy was thrown. Alongside
this stone they hold a "bird-fair" every summer, where jackdaws, starlings, and other birds
are sold, with a few rabbits thrown in; but the fair now is chiefly an excuse for a holiday.
The church was three hundred feet long, with the convent-buildings to the southward, but only
scant ruins remain. Beyond the ruins, at the edge of the greensward, the river glides along
under a gray stone bridge. At Howsham, in the neighborhood, Hudson the railway king was born,
and at Foston-le-Clay Sydney Smith lived, having for his friends the Earl and Countess of Carlisle
of that day, who made their first call in a gold coach and got stuck fast in the clay. Here
the witty vicar resided, having been presented to a living, and built himself a house, which
he described as "the ugliest in the county," but admitted by all critics to be "one of the
most comfortable," though located "twenty miles from a lemon." Subsequently Smith left here
for Somersetshire.

SCARBOROUGH AND WHITBY.

The coast of Yorkshire affords the boldest and grandest scenery on the eastern shore of England.
A great protruding backbone of chalk rocks projects far into the North Sea at Flamborough Head,
and makes one of the most prominent landmarks on all that rugged, iron-bound coast. This is
the Ocellum Promontorium of Ptolemy, and its lighthouse is three hundred and thirty feet above
the sea, while far away over the waters the view is superb. From Flamborough Head northward
beyond Whitby the coast-line is a succession of abrupt white cliffs and bold headlands, presenting
magnificent scenery. About twenty-three miles north of Flamborough is the "Queen of Northern
Watering-places," as Scarborough is pleased to be called, where a bold headland three hundred
feet high juts out into the North Sea for a mile, having on each side semicircular bays, each
about a mile and a quarter wide. At the extreme point of the lozenge-shaped promontory stands
the ruined castle which named the town Scar-burgh, with the sea washing the rocky base of its
foundations on three sides. Steep cliffs run precipitously down to the narrow beach that fringes
these bays around, and on the cliffs is the town of Scarborough, while myriads of fishing-vessels
cluster about the breakwater-piers that have been constructed to make a harbor of refuge. It
would be difficult to find a finer situation, and art has improved it to the utmost, especially
as mineral springs add the attractions of a spa to the sea air and bathing. The old castle,
battered by war and the elements, is a striking ruin, the precipitous rock on which it stands
being a natural fortress. The Northmen when they first invaded Britain made its site their
stronghold, but the present castle was not built until the reign of King Stephen, when its
builder, William le Gros, Earl of Albemarle, was so powerful in this part of Yorkshire that
it was said he was "in Stephen's days the more real king." But Henry II. compelled the proud
earl to submit to his authority, though "with much searching of heart and choler," and Scarborough
afterwards became one of the royal castles, Edward I. in his earlier years keeping court there.
It was there that Edward II. was besieged and his favorite Gaveston starved into surrender,
and then beheaded on Blacklow Hill in violation of the terms of his capitulation. Scarborough
was repeatedly attacked by the Scotch, but it subsequently enjoyed an interval of peace until
the Reformation. In Wyatt's rebellion his friends secured possession of the castle by stratagem.
A number of his men, disguised as peasants, on market-day strolled one by one into the castle,
and then at a given signal overpowered the sentinels and admitted the rest of their band. The
castle, however, was soon recaptured from the rebels, and Thomas Stafford, the leader in this
enterprise, was beheaded. From this event is derived the proverb of a "Scarborough warning"--a
word and a blow, but the blow first. In Elizabeth's reign Scarborough was little else but a
fishing-village, and so unfortunate that it appealed to the queen for aid. In the Civil War
the castle was held by the Royalists, and was besieged for six months. While the guns could
not reduce it, starvation did, and the Parliamentary army took possession. Three years later
the governor declared for the king, and the castle again stood a five months' siege, finally
surrendering. Since then it has fallen into decay, but it was a prison-house for George Fox
the Quaker, who was treated with severity there. A little way down the hill are the ruins of
the ancient church of St. Mary, which has been restored.

The cliffs on the bay to the south of Castle Hill have been converted into a beautifully-terraced
garden and promenade. Here, amid flowers and summer houses and terraced walks, is the fashionable
resort, the footpaths winding up and down the face of the cliffs or broadening into the gardens,
where music is provided and there are nightly illuminations. Millions of money have been expended
in beautifying the front of the cliffs adjoining the Spa, which is on the seashore, and to
which Scarborough owed its original fame as a watering-place. The springs were discovered in
1620, and by the middle of the last century had become fashionable, but the present ornamental
Spa was erected only about forty years ago. There is a broad esplanade in front. There are
two springs, one containing more salt, lime, and magnesia sulphates than the other. In the
season, this esplanade--in fact, the entire front of the cliffs--is full of visitors, while
before it are rows of little boxes on wheels, the bathing-houses that are drawn into the water.
The surf is usually rather gentle, however, though the North Sea can knock things about at
a lively rate in a storm.

North of Scarborough the coast extends, a grand escarpment of cliffs and headlands, past Robin
Hood's Bay, with its rocky barriers, the North Cheek and the South Cheek, to the little harbor
of another watering-place, Whitby. The cliffs here are more precipitous and the situation even
more picturesque than at Scarborough. The river Esk has carved a deep glen in the Yorkshire
moorland, and in this the town nestles, climbing the steep banks on either side of the river.
The ruins of Whitby Abbey are located high up on the side of the ravine opposite to the main
part of the town, and they still present a noble if dilapidated pile. The nave fell after a
storm in the last century, and a similar cause threw down the central tower in 1830. The choir
and northern transept are still standing, extremely beautiful Early English work: only fragments
of other portions of the abbey remain. This was in olden times the Westminster of Northumbria,
containing the tombs of Eadwine and of Oswy, with kings and nobles grouped around them. It
has been over twelve hundred years since a religious house was founded at Whitby, at first
known as the White Homestead, an outgrowth of the abbey, which was founded by Oswy and presided
over by the sainted Hilda, who chose the spot upon the lonely crags by the sea. The fame of
Whitby as a place of learning soon spread, and here lived the cowherd Cædmon, the first English
poet. The Danes sacked and burned it but after the Norman Conquest, under the patronage of
the Percies, the abbey grew in wealth and fame. Fragments of the monastery yet remain, and
on the hill a little lower down is the parish church, with a long flight of steps leading up
to it from the harbor along which the people go, and when there is a funeral the coffin has
to be slung in order to be carried up the steps. Whitby is famous for its jet, which is worked
into numerous ornaments: this is a variety of fossil wood, capable of being cut and taking
a high polish. It is also celebrated for its production of iron-ore, which indeed is a product
of all this part of Yorkshire; while at night, along the valley of the Tees, not far north
of Whitby, the blaze of the myriads of furnaces light up the heavens like the fire of Vesuvius
in the Bay of Naples. Among the tales of the abbey is that which

    "Whitby's nuns exulting told,
  How to their house three barons bold
  Must menial service do."

It appears that three gentlemen--De Bruce, De Percy, and Allaston--were hunting boars on the
abbey-lands in 1159, and roused a fine one, which their dogs pressed hard and chased to the
hermitage, where it ran into the chapel and dropped dead. The hermit closed the door against
the hounds, and the hunters, coming up, were enraged to find the dogs baulked of their prey,
and on the hermit's opening the door they attacked him with their boar-spears and mortally
wounded him. It was not long before they found that this was dangerous sport, and they took
sanctuary at Scarborough. The Church, however, did not protect those who had insulted it, and
they were given up to the abbot of Whitby, who was about to make an example of them when the
dying hermit summoned the abbot and the prisoners to his bedside and granted them their lives
and lands. But it was done upon a peculiar tenure: upon Ascension Day at sunrise they were
to come to the wood on Eskdale-side, and the abbot's officer was to deliver to each "ten stakes,
eleven stout stowers, and eleven yethers, to be cut by you, or some of you, with a knife of
one penny price;" these they were to take on their backs to Whitby before nine o'clock in the
morning. The officer of Eskdale-side shall blow, 'Out on you, out on you, out on you for this
heinous crime!'" Failure of this strange service was to forfeit their lands to the abbot of Whitby.

DURHAM.

We have now come into a region of coal and iron, with mines and furnaces in abundance, and
tall chimneys in all the villages pouring out black smoke. All the country is thoroughly cultivated,
and the little streams bubbling over the stones at the bottoms of the deep valleys, past sloping
green fields and occasional patches of woods where the land is too steep for cultivation, give
picturesqueness to the scene. We have crossed over the boundary from Yorkshire into Durham,
and upon the very crooked little river Wear there rise upon the tops of the precipitous cliffs
bordering the stream, high elevated above the red-tiled roofs of the town, the towers of Durham
Cathedral and Castle. They stand in a remarkable position. The Wear, swinging around a curve
like an elongated horseshoe, has excavated a precipitous valley out of the rocks. At the narrower
part of the neck there is a depression, so that the promontory around which the river sweeps
appears like the wrist with the hand clenched. The town stands at the depression, descending
the slopes on either side to the river, and also spreading upon the opposite banks. The castle
bars the access to the promontory, upon which stands the cathedral. Thus, almost impregnably
fortified, the ancient bishops of Durham were practically sovereigns, and they made war as
quickly as they would celebrate a mass if their powers were threatened, for they bore alike
the sword and the crozier. Durham was founded to guard the relics of the famous St. Cuthbert
of Lindisfarne, the great ascetic of the early English Church, distinguished above all others
for the severity of his mortifications and his abhorrence of women. At his shrine, we are told,
none of the gentler sex might worship; they were admitted to the church, but in the priory
not even a queen could lodge. Queen Philippa was once admitted there as a guest, but a tumult
arose, and she had to flee half dressed for safety to the castle. St. Cuthbert was a hermit
to whom the sight of human beings was a weariness and the solitude of the desert a delight.
He was born in Scotland about the middle of the seventh century, of humble origin, and passed
his early years as a shepherd near Melrose. He adopted an austere life, found a friend in the
abbot of Melrose, and ultimately sickened of an epidemic, his recovery being despaired of.
In answer, however, to the prayers of the monks, he was restored to health as by a miracle,
and became the prior of Melrose. Afterwards he was for twelve years prior of Lindisfarne, an
island off the Northumbrian coast, but the craving for solitude was too strong to be resisted,
and he became a hermit. He went to Farne, a lonely rocky island in the neighboring sea, and,
living in a hut, spent his life in prayer and fasting, but having time, according to the legend,
to work abundant miracles. A spring issued from the rock to give him water, the sea laid fagots
at his feet, and the birds ministered to his wants. At first other monks had free access to
him, but gradually he secluded himself in the hut, speaking to them through the window, and
ultimately closed even that against them except in cases of emergency. Such sanctity naturally
acquired wide fame, and after long urging he consented to become a bishop, at first at Hexham,
afterwards at Lindisfarne, thus returning to familiar scenes and an island home. But his life
was ebbing, and after two years' service he longed again for his hermit's hut on the rock of
Farne. He resigned the bishopric, and, returning to his hut, in a few weeks died. His brethren
buried him beside his altar, where he rested eleven years; then exhuming the body, it was found
thoroughly preserved, and was buried again in a new coffin at Lindisfarne. Almost two hundred
years passed, when the Danes made an incursion, and to escape them the monks took the body,
with other precious relics, and left Lindisfarne. During four years they wandered about with
their sacred charge, and ultimately settled near Chester-le-Street, where the body of St. Cuthbert
rested for over a century; but another Danish invasion in 995 sent the saint's bones once more
on their travels, and they were taken to Ripon. The danger past, the monks started on their
return, transporting the coffin on a carriage. They had arrived at the Wear, when suddenly
the carriage stopped and was found to be immovable. This event no doubt had a meaning, and
the monks prayed and fasted for three days to learn what it was. Then the saint appeared in
a vision and said he had chosen this spot for his abode. It was a wild place, known as Dunhelm:
the monks went to the Dun, or headland, and erected a tabernacle for their ark from the boughs
of trees while they built a stone church, within which, in the year 999, the body was enshrined.
This church stood until after the Norman Conquest, when the king made its bishop the Earl of
Durham, and his palatinate jurisdiction began.

The present Durham Cathedral was begun in 1093, with the castle alongside. As we look at them
from the railway-station, they stand a monument of the days when the same hand grasped the
pastoral staff and the sword--"half house of God, half castle 'gainst the Scot." Upon the top
of the rocks, which are clad in foliage to the river's edge, on the left hand, supported by
massive outworks built up from halfway down the slope, rises the western face of the castle.
Beyond this, above a fringe of trees, rises the lofty cathedral, its high central tower forming
the apex of the group and its two western towers looking down into the ravine. The galilee
in front appears built up from the depths of the valley, and is supported by outworks scarcely
less solid than those of the castle. Durham, more than any other place in England, is a memorial
of the temporal authority of the Church, uniting the mitre and the coronet. The plan of Durham
Cathedral is peculiar in having the closed galilee at the western end, instead of the open
porch as is usual, while the eastern end, which is wider than the choir, terminates abruptly,
having no Lady Chapel, but being in effect cut off, with a gable in the centre and a great
rose-window. As the galilee overhangs the ravine, the principal entrance to the cathedral is
from a fine northern porch. To the portal is affixed a large knocker of quaint design, which
in former days was a Mecca for the fugitive, for the shrine of St. Cuthbert enjoyed the right
of sanctuary. When the suppliant grasped this knocker he was safe, for over the door two monks
kept perpetual watch to open at the first stroke. As soon as admitted the suppliant was required
to confess his crime, whatever it might be. This was written down, and a bell in the galilee
tolled to announce the fact that some one had sought "the peace of Cuthbert;" and he was then
clothed in a black gown with a yellow cross on the shoulder. After thirty-seven days, if no
pardon could be obtained, the malefactor solemnly abjured his native land for ever, and was
conveyed to the seacoast, bearing a white wooden cross in his hand, and was sent out of the
kingdom by the first ship that sailed.

The interior of Durham Cathedral is regarded as the noblest Norman construction yet remaining
in England. The arcade, triforium, and clerestory are in fine proportion; the nave has a vaulted
roof of stone, and the alternate columns are clustered in plan, their middle shafts extending
from floor to roof. These columns are enriched with zigzag, lattice, spiral, and vertical flutings.
This cathedral, begun in 1093, was nearly two centuries building, and the Chapel of Nine Altars,
in honor of various saints, was erected at the eastern end in the twelfth century. Some of
these altars did duty for a pair of saints, St. Cuthbert sharing the central one with St. Bede,
a name only second to his in the memories of Durham, so that the nine altars were availed of
to reverence sixteen saints. Behind the reredos a platform extends a short distance into this
chapel at a height of six feet above the floor. A large blue flagstone is let into the platform,
with shallow grooves on either hand. Here stood St. Cuthbert's shrine, highly ornamented, and
having seats underneath for the pilgrims and cripples who came to pray for relief. This being
never wanting, we are told that the shrine came to be so richly invested that it was esteemed
one of the most sumptuous monuments in England, so numerous were the offerings and jewels bestowed
upon it. Among the relics here accumulated was the famous Black Rood of Scotland, the prize
of the battle of Neville's Cross, fought near Durham. There were also many relics of saints
and martyrs, scraps of clothing of the Saviour and the Virgin, pieces of the crown of thorns
and of the true cross, vials containing the milk of the Virgin Mother and the blood of St.
Thomas, besides elephants' tusks and griffins' claws and eggs, with myriads of jewels. In 1104,
St. Cuthbert's body was deposited in this shrine with solemn ceremonies, and it rested there
undisturbed until the dissolution of the monasteries, reverentially watched, day and night,
by monks stationed in an adjoining chamber. Then the shrine was destroyed and the treasures
scattered, the coffin opened, and St. Cuthbert buried beneath the slab, so that now the only
remnants visible are the furrows worn in the adjoining pavement by the feet of the ancient
worshippers. Tradition tells that the exact position of St. Cuthbert's grave is known only
to three Benedictine monks, of whom Scott writes:

  "There, deep in Durham's Gothic shade,
  His relics are in secret laid,
    But none may know the place,
  Save of his holiest servants three,
  Deep sworn to solemn secrecy,
    Who share that wondrous grace."

The corpse, however, rests beneath the blue slab. In 1827 it was raised, and, while other human
remains were found, there was disclosed beneath them, in a coffin, a skeleton vested in mouldering
robes, and with it various treasures, which, with the robes, accord with the description of
those present in St. Cuthbert's coffin when opened in 1104. The skeleton was reinterred in
a new coffin, and the relics, particularly an ancient golden cross and a comb, were placed
in the cathedral library.

In the galilee of Durham Cathedral, near the south-eastern angle, is a plain, low altar-tomb
that marks the resting-place of St. Bede, commonly known as "the Venerable Bede"--a title which
angelic hands are said to have supplied to the line inscribed on his tomb. He was the first
English historian, a gentle, simple scholar, who spent his life from childhood in a monastery
at Jarrow, near the mouth of the Wear, and took his pleasure in learning, teaching, or writing.
His great work was the Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation, which occupied many years
in compilation, and is still the most trusted history of the period of which it treats. His
literary activity was extraordinary, and he produced many other works. He was born near Durham
in 672, and died in 735. His devotion to literary work was such that even during his last illness
he was dictating to an amanuensis a translation of the Gospel of St. John into Anglo-Saxon,
and upon completing the last sentence requested the assistant to place him on the floor of
his cell, where he said a short prayer, and expired as the closing words passed his lips. He
was buried where he had lived, at Jarrow, and as the centuries passed the fame of his sanctity
and learning increased. Then a certain Ælfred conceived the idea of stealing St. Bede's remains
for the glorification of Durham. Several times baffled, he at length succeeded, and carrying
the precious relics to Durham, they were for a time preserved in St. Cuthbert's shrine, but
were afterwards removed to a separate tomb, which in 1370 was placed in the galilee, where
it has since remained. At the Reformation the shrine was destroyed, and St. Bede's bones, like
St. Cuthbert's, were buried beneath the spot on which the shrine had stood. This tomb was opened
in 1831, and many human bones were found beneath, together with a gilt ring. The bones in all
probability were St. Bede's remains. Durham Cathedral contains few monuments, for reverence
for the solitude of St. Cuthbert whom it enshrined excluded memorials of other men during several
centuries.

The remains of the Benedictine monastery to which the care of these shrines was entrusted are
south of the cathedral, forming three sides of a square, of which the cathedral nave was the
fourth. Beyond is an open green, with the castle on the farther side and old buildings on either
hand. From this green the castle is entered by a gateway with massive doors, but, while the
structure is picturesque, it is not very ancient, excepting this gateway. It has mostly been
rebuilt since the twelfth century. This was the palace of the bishops of Durham, of whom Antony
Bek raised the power of the see to its highest point. He was prelate, soldier, and politician,
equally at home in peace or war, at the head of his troops, celebrating a mass, or surrounded
by his great officers of state. He was the first who intruded upon the solitude of St. Cuthbert
by being buried in the cathedral. Here lived also Richard of Bury, noted as the most learned
man of his generation north of the Alps, and the first English bibliomaniac. Bishop Hatfield
also ruled at Durham, famous both as architect and warrior. Cardinal Wolsey lived here when
Archbishop of York and his quarrel with Henry VIII. resulted in the Durham palatinate beginning
to lose part of its power, so that in the days of his successor, Tunstall, it came to be the
"peace of the king," and not of the bishop, that was broken within its borders. Here also ruled
the baron-bishop Crewe, who was both a temporal and a spiritual peer, and Bishop Butler, the
profound thinker. But the bishops live there no longer, their palace being moved to Auckland,
while the university is located in the castle. It is the Northern University, first projected
in Cromwell's time. About a mile to the westward of Durham was fought the battle of Neville's
Cross in October, 1346. This was a few months after Edward had won the battle of Crecy in France,
and the King of Scotland, taking advantage of the absence of the English king and his army,
swept over the Border with forty thousand men, devastating the entire country. His chief nobles
accompanied him, and to encourage the troops the most sacred relic of Scotland, the "Black
Rood," a crucifix of blackened silver, was present on the battlefield. This had been mysteriously
delivered to David I. on the spot in Edinburgh where to commemorate it Holyrood Abbey was afterwards
founded. But, though King Edward was in France, Queen Philippa was equal to the emergency.
An army was quickly gathered under Earl Neville, and Durham sent its contingent headed by the
warlike bishop. The invaders drew near the walls of Durham, and the English army, inferior
in numbers, awaited them. To confront the "Black Rood," the bishop brought into camp an "ark
of God" in obedience to a vision: this was one of the cathedral's choicest treasures, "the
holy corporax cloth wherewith St. Cuthbert covered the chalice when he used to say mass." This,
attached to the point of a spear, was displayed in sight of the army, while the monks upon
the cathedral towers, in full view of the battlefield, prayed for victory for the defenders
of St. Cuthbert's shrine. They fought three hours in the morning, the Scotch with axes, the
English with arrows; but, as the watching monks turned from prayer to praise, the Scottish
line wavered and broke, for the banner of St. Cuthbert proved too much for the Black Rood.
The King of Scotland was wounded and captured, and fifteen thousand of his men were slain,
including many nobles. The Black Rood was captured, and placed in the Nine Altars Chapel. Afterwards
the "corporax cloth" was attached to a velvet banner, and became one of the great standards
of England, being carried against Scotland by Richard II. and Henry IV., and it waved over
the English army at Flodden. When not in use it was attached to St. Cuthbert's shrine. At the
Reformation the Black Rood was lost, and St. Cuthbert's banner fell into possession of one
Dean Whittingham, whose wife, the historian lamentingly says, "being a Frenchwoman, did most
despitefully burn the same in her fire, to the open contempt and disgrace of all ancient relics."
A narrow lane, deeply fringed with ferns, leads out of Durham over the hills to the westward
of the town, where at a cross-road stand the mutilated remains of Earl Neville's Cross, set
up to mark the battlefield, now a wide expanse of smoky country.

LUMLEY CASTLE AND NEWCASTLE.

Following the Wear northward towards its mouth, at a short distance below Durham it passes
the site of the Roman city of Conderum, which had been the resting-place of St. Cuthbert's
bones until the Danish invasion drove them away, and it is now known as Chester-le-Street.
Here, in the old church of St. Mary and St. Cuthbert, is the rude effigy of the saint which
once surmounted his tomb, and here also is the "Aisle of Tombs," a chain of fourteen monumental
effigies of the Lumleys, dating from Queen Elizabeth's reign. Lumley Castle, now the Earl of
Scarborough's seat (for he too is a Lumley), is a short distance outside the town, on an eminence
overlooking the Wear. It dates from the time of Edward I., but has been much modernized, the
chief apartment in the interior being the Great Hall, sixty by thirty feet, with the Minstrel
Gallery at the western end. Here on the wall is a life-size statue of the great ancestor of
the Lumleys, Liulph the Saxon, seated on a red horse. North of this castle, across the Wear,
is the Earl of Durham's seat, Lambton Castle, a Gothic and Tudor structure recently restored.

Still journeying northward, we cross the hills between the Wear and the Tyne, and come to the
New Castle which gives its name to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, the great coal shipping port. This
is a strange-looking town, with red-tiled roofs, narrow, dingy, crooked streets, and myriads
of chimneys belching forth smoke from the many iron-works. These mills and furnaces are numerous
also in the surrounding country, while the neighborhood is a network of railways carrying coal
from the various lines to the shipping-piers. But this famous city is not all smoke and coal-dust:
its New Castle is an ancient structure, rather dilapidated now, coming down from the reign
of Henry II., approached by steep stairways up the rock on which the keep is perched. It has
a fine hall, which is used as a museum of Roman relics, and from the roof is a grand view along
the Tyne. This castle has a well ninety-three feet deep bored in the rock. Newcastle in its
newer parts has some fine buildings. Grey Street, containing the theatre and Exchange, for
a space of about four hundred yards is claimed to be the finest street in the kingdom. In Low
Friars Street is the old chapel of the Black Friars monastery, where Baliol did homage to Edward
III. for the Scottish throne. Sir William Armstrong lives at Jesmond, just outside Newcastle,
and at Elswick, west of the city, are the extensive workshops where are made the Armstrong
guns. The great High Level bridge across the Tyne Valley, built by Stephenson, with a railway
on top of a roadway, and one thousand three hundred and thirty-seven feet long, is one of the
chief engineering works at Newcastle. George Stephenson was born in 1781 at High Street House,
Wylam, near Newcastle, while at Frudhoe Castle is a seat of the Duke of Northumberland. At
Wallsend, three miles east of Newcastle, begins the celebrated Roman wall that crossed Britain,
and was defended by their legions against incursions by the Scots. Its stone-and-turf walls,
with the ditch on the north side, can be distinctly traced across the island.

HEXHAM.

Ascending the Tyne, we come to Hexham, an imposing town as approached by the railway, with
the Moat Hall and the abbey church occupying commanding features in the landscape. The Moat
Hall is a large and ancient tower, notable for its narrow lights and cornice-like range of
corbels. The abbey church, formerly the cathedral of St. Andrew, is a fine specimen of Early
English architecture, of which only the transept and some other ruins remain, surmounted by
a tower rising about one hundred feet and supported upon magnificent arches. Here is the shrine
of the ancient chronicler. Prior Richard, an attractive oratory: and the town also produced
another quaint historian of the Border troubles, John of Hexham. It is an antique place, and
almost all of its old buildings bear testimony to the disturbed state of the Scottish frontier
in the olden time, for not far away are the Cheviot Hills that form the boundary, and in which
the Tyne takes its rise. Similar evidence is also given in Haltwhistle, Hexham's suburb, across
the narrow river.

ALNWICK CASTLE.

Journeying northward through Northumberland, and following the coastline--for here England
narrows as the Scottish border is approached--the road crosses the diminutive river Alne, running
through a deep valley, and standing in an imposing situation on its southern bank is the renowned
stronghold of the Percies and guardian of the Border, Alnwick Castle. The great fortress, as
we now see it, was built as a defence against the Scots, and was protected on the northward
by the river-valley and a deep ravine, which formerly cut it off from the village, which is
as ancient as the fortress, as its quaint old Pottergate Tower attests. Roman remains have
been found on the site, and it was also inhabited by the Saxons, the castle at the time of
the Norman Conquest being held by Gilbert Tysen, a powerful Northumbrian chief. It was then
a primitive timber fortress in a wild region, for the earliest masonry works are Norman, and
are attributed to Tysen's descendants. Alnwick Castle is a cluster of semicircular and angular
bastions, surrounded by lofty walls, defended at intervals by towers, and enclosing a space
of about five acres. It has three courts or wards, each defended formerly by massive gates,
with portcullis, porters lodge, and a strong guardhouse, beneath which was a dungeon. Trap-doors
are the only entrances to the latter, into which the prisoners were lowered by ropes. From
the village the entrance to the castle is through the barbican, or outer gate, a work of gigantic
strength and massive grandeur, which has been the scene of many a brave encounter. Near by
is the Postern Tower, a sally-port adjacent to the "Bloody Gap" and "Hotspur's Chair." The
history of this famous stronghold is practically the history of this portion of the realm,
for in all the Border warfare that continued for centuries it was conspicuous. In the reign
of William Rufus it was gallantly defended by Mowbray, Earl of Northumberland, in the memorable
siege by the Scots under King Malcolm III. The garrison were about surrendering, being almost
starved, when a private soldier undertook their deliverance. He rode out to the besiegers'
camp, carrying the keys of the castle dangling from his lance, and presented himself a suppliant
before the Scottish king, as if to deliver up the keys. Malcolm advanced to receive them, and
the soldier pierced him through the heart. Malcolm fell dead, and in the confusion the bold
trooper sprang upon his horse, dashed across the river, and was safe. Malcolm's eldest son,
Prince Edward, advanced rashly to avenge the king's death, and fell mortally wounded from the
castle. Hammond's Ford, named for the bold trooper, marks the spot where he and his horse swam
across the Alne, which at the time was swollen. In memory of Malcolm, a cross stands on the
spot where he was slain, and near by is Malcolm's Well and the ruins of St. Leonard's Chapel,
built for the unfortunate king's expiation. Upon the cross the inscription states that Malcolm
fell November 13, 1093, and that the original cross, decayed by time, was restored by his descendant,
Elizabeth, Duchess of Northumberland, in 1774. Eustace de Vesci, who built St. Leonard's Chapel,
lived in the days of Henry I. and Stephen, and founded the abbey of Alnwick. King David of
Scotland captured the old timber castle there in 1135 on his great invasion of England, and
Eustace afterwards built the first masonry work of Alnwick Castle, traces of his walls having
since been found.

Alnwick descended to William, son of Eustace, and in 1174, William the Lion, returning from
an invasion of Cumberland, passed before the castle, and was captured and sent a prisoner into
England. Alnwick descended to William's son Eustace, who was visited by King John in 1209,
and the king there received the homage of Alexander of Scotland. Eustace was one of the chief
barons who wrested Magna Charta from John, and in the closing year of that reign met his death
from an arrow before Barnard Castle. Henry III. visited Alnwick, and the great Edward I. was
there several times as the guest of John de Vesci near the close of the thirteenth century.
The Barons de Vesci soon afterwards became extinct, and then the warlike bishop of Durham,
Antony Bek, came in and grabbed the castle. He sold it in 1309 to Henry de Percy, and from
this dates the rise of the great family of the northern Border, who have held Alnwick for nearly
six centuries, its present owner being his descendant, Algernon George Percy, Duke of Northumberland,
in whose veins flows the blood of so many great families that he can use nine hundred heraldic
devices on his armorial bearings, including those of many kings and princes. Henry de Percy
became the leader of the Border barons, and, although living at Alnwick only five years, seems
to have rebuilt most of the castle, his son completing it. The Percies became the Earls of
Northumberland, and such warlike lives did they lead (as, for instance, young Henry Percy,
"Hotspur") that it is noted that Henry Algernon, the fifth earl, was the first of the race
who died in bed. The next of the line was executed for rebellion, and the next was beheaded
at York for conspiring against Queen Elizabeth. The eighth earl, favoring Mary Queen of Scots,
was imprisoned in the Tower, and was one day found in his chamber shot through the heart. Henry,
the ninth earl, was implicated in the Gunpowder Plot, imprisoned in the Tower, and fined $250,000.
After his release he spent the remainder of his life at Petworth; Alnwick was neglected; and
the direct line of descent ultimately ended with Elizabeth, daughter of the eleventh earl,
who married the Duke of Somerset in 1682. Her grandson, Algernon, became Earl of Northumberland,
and his daughter, Elizabeth Seymour, was the ancestress of the present family, her husband
being created the first Duke of Northumberland. Alnwick was then a ruin, but he restored it,
and subsequently, under the direction of the architect Salvin, it was completely rebuilt, everything
worthy of preservation being kept, and the new work being adapted to the days of the earlier
Percies, whose achievements gave the stronghold such world-wide renown.

This famous castle is full of recollections of the great men who formerly inhabited it. The
Constable's Tower, remaining mostly in its ancient condition, has in an upper apartment arms
for fifteen hundred men, the Percy tenantry, while in the rooms beneath is deposited the ancient
armor. "Hotspur's Chair" is the name given to a seated recess of the Ravine Tower which was
Hotspur's favorite resort, where he sat while his troops exercised in the castle-yard beneath,
and where he had an admirable lookout to discover an approaching enemy. Through the loopholes
on either side of the seat in this commanding tower there is an extensive prospect over the
valley of the Alne and to the distant seacoast. The "Bloody Gap," another noted site in the
castle, is between the Ravine and Round Towers. It was the name given to a breach in the wall
made by the Scots during the Border wars, although the exact time is unknown. According to
tradition, three hundred Scots fell within the breach, and they were ultimately beaten off.
Many arrows have been found in the adjacent walls, so located as to indicate they were shot
from the battlements and windows of the keep when the assailants were making this breach. Alnwick
Castle was restored by Salvin with strict regard to the rules of mediæval military architecture.
When it was the great Border stronghold its governor commanded a force of no less than two
thousand men, who were employed in a complicated system of day and night watching to guard
against forays by the Scots. The day watchers began at daylight, and blew a horn on the approach
of the foe, when all men were bound on pain of death to respond for the general defence. The
great feature of the restored castle is the Prudhoe Tower, built about twenty-five years ago.
After entering the barbican, which admits to the outer ward, the visitor passes between the
Abbot's Tower on the left and the Corner Tower and Auditor's Tower on the right. Earl Hugh's
turreted tower also rises boldly from the battlements. Passing through the middle gatehouse,
the keep, constructed in the form of a polygon around a court, is seen on the right hand, and
in the gateway-wall is Percy's famous draw-well, with a statue of St. James above blessing
the waters. Opposite this draw-well is a covered drive which leads to the entrance of Prudhoe
Tower. This tower is a magnificent structure, containing the family and state-apartments, built
and decorated in the Italian style, and approached by a staircase twelve feet wide. It was
built at enormous cost, and alongside is a vaulted kitchen of ample proportions, constructed
in the baronial style, where there are sufficient facilities to prepare dinner for six hundred
persons at one time, while the subterranean regions contain bins for three hundred tons of
coal. Such is this great baronial Border stronghold, replete with memories of the warlike Percies.
From here Hotspur sallied forth to encounter the marauding Scottish force which under Douglas
had laid waste England as far as the gates of York, and almost within the sight of the castle
is the bloody field of Otterbourn, where Douglas fell by Hotspur's own hand, though the English
lost the day and Hotspur himself was captured. Again, as war's fortunes change, just north
of Alnwick is Humbleton Hill, where the Scots had to fly before England's "deadly arrow-hail,"
leaving their leader, Douglas, with five wounds and only one eye, a prisoner in the hands of
the Percies. It was from Alnwick's battlements that the countess watched "the stout Earl of
Northumberland" set forth, "his pleasure in the Scottish woods three summer days to take"--an
expedition from which he never returned. Such was the history for centuries of this renowned
castle, which is regarded as presenting the most perfect specimen now existing, perhaps in
the world, of the feudal stronghold of mediæval days.

And now let us turn from the castle to the church. Almost alongside of it is St. Michael's
Church, built with battlements, as if prepared as much for defence as for worship, and a watch-tower,
made evidently for a lookout and to hold a beacon to warn of the approach of forays. This was
one of the regular chain of Border beacons. Within the church an old iron-work lectern still
holds the "Book of the Homilies," while the churchyard is full of ancient gravestones. Alnwick
Abbey once existed down alongside the river, under the protection of the castle, but it has
been long since ruined, and its remains have served as a quarry for the village buildings until
little of them remains. Its extensive domains are now part of the Duke's Park, and another
contributor to this park was Hulne Priory, the earliest Carmelite monastery in England, founded
in 1240. It stood upon a projecting spur of rising land above the Alne, backed by rich woods,
but was neither large nor wealthy, as the neighboring abbey eclipsed it. The discipline of
the Carmelites was rigorous. Each friar had a coffin for his cell and slept on straw, while
every morning he dug a shovelful of earth for his grave and crept on his knees in prayer. Silence,
solitude, and strict fasting were the injunction upon all, and their buildings were sternly
simple. The porter's lodge and curtain-wall enclosing Hulne Priory still stand, and its outline
can be traced, though the ruins are scant. Yet this, like all else at Alnwick, bears evidence
of the troublous times on the Border. The most important of its remaining buildings is an embattled
tower of refuge from the Scottish invader. Its inscription states that it was built in 1448
by Sir Henry Percy, fourth Earl of Northumberland. Opposite Hulne Priory is Brislee Hill, which
presents the most renowned view in Alnwick Park. A tower rises among the trees upon the crest
of the hill from which bonfires now blaze on occasions of festivity. Here, over the park, can
be seen the castle and town, and beyond, to the eastward, the sea, with its coast-castles as
far north as Bamborough. The little Coquet Island in the distance breaks the expanse of blue
waters. To the westward beyond the moors rises the sharp outline of the Scottish Border, the
Cheviot Hills, running off towards the north-east, and containing in their depressions the
passes through which the Scots used to pour when they harried Northern England and roused the
Alnwick warriors to defend their firesides.

FORD CASTLE AND FLODDEN FIELD.

Northward, past the extremity of the Cheviots, flows the Tweed, and one of its tributaries
on the English side is the Till, which drains the bases of those sharp hills, that rise nearly
twenty-seven hundred feet. Here was Ford Castle, and here was fought the terrible Border battle
of Flodden in 1513. Ford Castle dated from the time of Edward I., and its proximity to the
Border made it the object of many assaults. In the fifteenth century it was held by Sir William
Heron, and a few days before the battle of Flodden the Scots, under James IV., during Sir William's
captivity in Scotland, stormed and destroyed Ford, taking captive Lady Heron, who had endeavored
to defend it. In the last century Ford was restored by the Marquis of Waterford, to whom it
had descended, so that it now appears as a fine baronial mansion, surmounted by towers and
battlements, and standing in a commanding situation overlooking the valley of the Till, with
the lofty Cheviots closing the view a few miles to the south-west, their peaks affording ever-varying
scenes as the season changes.

The great attraction of the view, however, is the famous hill of Flodden, about a mile to the
westward, crowned by a plantation of dark fir trees, and presenting, with the different aspects
of the weather, ever-changeful scenery, recalling now the "dark Flodden" and anon the "red
Flodden" of the balladists. Across the valley from Ford Castle, and at the foot of this fir-crowned
hill, was fought one of the bitterest contests of the Border. Now, the famous battlefield is
a highly-cultivated farm and sheep-pasture. James IV. of Scotland had unjustly determined to
make war upon England, and he set out upon it in opposition to the real desire of his countrymen,
and even against the omens of Heaven, as the people believed. A few days before he departed
for his army the king attended St. Michael's Church, adjacent to his stately palace at Linlithgow,
when a venerable stranger entered the aisle where the king knelt. The hair from his uncovered
head flowed down over his shoulders, and his blue robe was confined by a linen girdle. With
an air of majesty he walked up to the kneeling king, and said, "Sire, I am sent to warn thee
not to proceed in thy present undertaking, for if thou dost it shall not fare well either with
thyself or those who go with thee." He vanished then in the awe-stricken crowd. But this was
not the only warning. At midnight, prior to the departure of the troops for the south, it is
related that a voice not mortal proclaimed a summons from the market cross, where proclamations
were usually read, calling upon all who should march against the English to appear within the
space of forty days before the court of the Evil One. Sir Walter Scott says that this summons,
like the apparition at Linlithgow, was probably an attempt by those averse to the war to impose
upon the superstitious temper of James IV. But the king started at the head of the finest army,
and supported by the strongest artillery-train, that had down to that time been brought into
the field by any Scottish monarch. He entered England August 22d. without having formed any
definite plan of action. He wasted two days on the Till, besieged Norham for a week, when it
surrendered, and then besieged Ford. These delays gave the English time to assemble. King James,
as above related, captured Lady Heron at Ford. She was beautiful and deceitful, and soon enthralled
the gay king in her spells, while all the time she was in communication with the English. Thus
James wasted his time in dalliance, and, as Scott tells us,

  "The monarch o'er the siren hung,
  And beat the measure as she sung,
  And, pressing closer and more near,
  He whispered praises in her ear."

All the time the energetic Earl of Surrey was marshalling the English hosts, and, marching
with twenty-six thousand men northward through Durham, received there the sacred banner of
St. Cuthbert. On September 4th. Surrey challenged James to battle, which the king accepted
against the advice of his best councillors. The Scots had become restive under the king's do-nothing
policy, and many of them left the camp and returned home with the booty already acquired. James
selected a strong position on Flodden Hill, with both flanks protected and having the deep
and sluggish waters of the Till flowing in front. Surrey advanced and reconnoitred, and then
sent the king a herald requesting him to descend into the plain, as he acted ungallantly in
thus practically shutting himself up in a fortress. The king would not admit the herald. Surrey
then attempted a stratagem. Crossing the Till on the 8th, he encamped at Barmoor Wood, about
two miles from the Scottish position, concealing his movement from the enemy. On the 9th he
marched down the Till to near its confluence with the Tweed, and recrossed to the eastern bank.
This, too, was uninterrupted by the Scots, who remained strangely inactive, though it is recorded
that the chief Scottish nobles implored the king to attack the English. The aged Earl Angus
begged him either to assault the English or retreat. "If you are afraid, Angus," replied the
king, "you can go home." The master of artillery implored the king to allow him to bring his
guns to bear upon the English, but James returned the reply that he would meet his antagonist
on equal terms in a fair field, and scorned to take an advantage. Then Surrey drew up his line
between James and the Border, and advanced up the valley of the Till towards the Scots. The
king set fire to the temporary huts on the hillside where he had been encamped, and descended
to the valley, the smoke concealing the movements of each army from the other; but Surrey's
stratagem was thus successful in drawing him from his strong position. The English van was
led by Lord Thomas Howard, Surrey commanding the main body, Sir Edward Stanley the rear, and
Lord Dacre the reserves. The Scottish advance was led by the Earls of Home and Huntley, the
king leading the centre, the Earls of Lennox and Argyle the rear, and the reserves, consisting
of the flower of the Lothians, were under the Earl of Bothwell. The battle began at four in
the afternoon, when the Scottish advance charged upon the right wing of the English advance
and routed it. Dacre promptly galloped forward with his reserves, and restored the fortunes
of the day for the English right. The main bodies in the mean time became engaged in a desperate
contest. The Scottish king in his ardor forgot that the duties of a commander were distinct
from the indiscriminate valor of a knight, and placed himself in front of his spearmen, surrounded
by his nobles, who, while they deplored the gallant weakness of such conduct, disdained to
leave their sovereign unprotected. Dacre and Howard, having defeated the Scottish wing in front
of them, at this time turned their full strength against the flank of the Scottish centre.
It was a terrific combat, the Scots fighting desperately in an unbroken ring around their king.
The battle lasted till night, and almost annihilated the Scottish forces. Of all the splendid
host, embracing the flower of the nobility and chivalry of the kingdom, only a few haggard
and wounded stragglers returned to tell the tale. The English victors lost five thousand slain,
and the Scots more than twice that number, and among them the greatest men of the land. They
left on the field their king, two bishops, two mitred abbots, twenty-seven peers and their
sons, and there was scarcely a family of any position in Scotland that did not lose a relative
there. The young Earl of Caithness and his entire band of three hundred followers perished
on the field. The body of the dead king, afterwards found by Dacre, was taken to Berwick and
presented to his commander, who had it embalmed and conveyed to the monastery of Sheyne in
Surrey. The poetic instincts of the Scots were deeply moved by the woes of the fatal field
of Flodden, and innumerable poems and ballads record the sad story, the crowning work of all
being Scott's Marmion.

BAMBOROUGH AND GRACE DARLING.

North of Flodden Field, and not far distant, is the Scottish Border, which in this part is
made by the river Tweed, with Berwick at its mouth. The two kingdoms, so long in hot quarrel,
are now united by a magnificent railway-bridge, elevated one hundred and twenty-five feet above
the river and costing $600,000. For miles along the coast the railway runs almost upon the
edge of the ocean, elevated on the cliffs high above the sea, while off the coast are Holy
Isle and Lindisfarne. Here St. Cuthbert was the bishop, and its abbey is a splendid ruin, while
on the rocky islet of Farne he lived a hermit, encompassing his cell with a mound so high that
he could see nothing but the heavens. Two miles from Farne, on the mainland, was the royal
city of Bebban Burgh, now Bamborough, the castle standing upon an almost perpendicular rock
rising one hundred and fifty feet and overlooking the sea. This was King Ida's castle, a Border
stronghold in ancient times whose massive keep yet stands. It is now a charity-school, a lighthouse,
and a life-saving station. Thirty beds are kept in the restored castle for shipwrecked sailors,
and Bamborough is to the mariner on that perilous coast what the convent of St. Bernard is
to the traveller in the Alps. Here, at this Border haven, we will close this descriptive tour
by recalling Bamborough's most pleasant memory--that of Grace Darling. She was a native of
the place, and was lodged, clothed, and educated at the school in Bamborough Castle. Her remains
lie in Bamborough churchyard under an altar-tomb bearing her recumbent figure and surmounted
by a Gothic canopy. She is represented lying on a plaited straw mattrass and holding an oar.
All this coast is beset with perils and wrecks have been frequent. The islet of Farne and a
cluster of other rocks off shore add to the dangers, and on some of them there are lighthouses.
One of these rocks--Longstone Island--Grace Darling rendered memorable by her intrepidity in
perilling her life during the storm of September, 1838. Her father was the keeper of Longstone
Light, and on the night of September 6 the Forfarshire steamer, proceeding from Hull to Dundee,
was wrecked there. Of fifty-three persons on board, thirty-eight perished, and on the morning
of the 7th, Grace, then about twenty-three years of age, discovered the survivors clinging
to the rocks and remnants of the steamer, in imminent danger of being washed off by the returning
tide. Poor Grace died four years later of consumption.

GLOUCESTER.

Journeying westward from the metropolis and beyond the sources of the Thames, let us mount
to the tops of the Cotswold Hills, in which they take their rise, and look down upon the valley
of the noble Severn River beyond. We have already seen the Severn at Shrewsbury, Wenlock, and
Bridgenorth, and, uniting with the classic Avon, it drains the western slopes of the Cotswolds,
and, flowing through a deep valley between them and the Malvern Hills, finally debouches through
a broad estuary into the British Channel. There is much of interest to the tourist along the
banks and in neighborhood of this well-known river. As we stand upon the elevations of the
Cotswolds and look over "Sabrina fair," the lower part of its valley is seen as a broad and
fertile plain, and the Severn's "glassy, cool, translucent wave," as the poet has it, flows
through a land of meadows, orchards, and cornfields, with the hills of the Forest of Dean rising
on the western horizon. Alongside the river is the cathedral city of Gloucester, the dépôt
for a rich agricultural region and for the mining wealth of Dean Forest, the Berkeley Canal
leading from its docks for sixteen miles down the Severn until the deep water of the estuary
is reached. The Romans early saw the importance of this place as a military post, and founded
Glevum here, upon their Ermine Street road, as an outpost fortress upon the border-land of
the Silures. Fragments of tessellated pavements, coins, and other relics from time to time
exhumed attest the extent of the Roman settlement. When the Britons succeeded the Romans, this
settlement became gradually transformed into Gleawecesore, forming part of the kingdom of Mercia,
and in the seventh century Æthelred bestowed it upon Osric, who founded a monastery here. Athelstan
died here in 941, and a few years afterwards the Danes, who overrun and devastated almost the
whole of England, burned the town and monastery. The history of Gloucester, however, was without
stirring incidents, excepting an occasional destructive fire, until the siege took place in
the Civil War, its people devoting themselves more to commerce than to politics, and in the
early part of the seventeenth century engaging extensively in the manufacture of pins. Gloucester,
however, gave the title to several earls and dukes, generally men not much envied; as, for
instance, Richard Crookback, who sent from Gloucester the order for the murder of his nephews,
the young princes, in the Tower. But the town never took kindly to him, and warmly welcomed
Richmond on his avenging march to Bosworth Field. The siege of Gloucester was made by King
Charles's troops, the citizens having warmly espoused the cause of the Parliament and strongly
fortified their city, mounting guns for its defence which they got from London. A polygonal
line of fortifications surrounded Gloucester, which was then much smaller than now, and the
bastions came down to the river, with outlying works to defend a small suburb on the opposite
bank. The Cavaliers were in great strength in Western England, and the malignity of the Gloucester
pin-makers seriously embarrassed them. On August 10, 1643, the siege began with a summons to
surrender, which the authorities refused. Parts of the suburbs were then burned, and next morning
a bombardment began, red-hot balls and heavy stones being plentifully thrown into the place,
knocking the houses into sad havoc, but in no wise damping the sturdy courage of the defenders.
They replied bravely with their cannon and made repeated sorties, which inflicted serious damage
upon the besiegers. After over three weeks of this sport, the Royalists shot an arrow into
the town, September 3, with a message in these words: "These are to let you understand your
god Waller hath forsaken you and hath retired himself to the Tower of London; Essex is beaten
like a dog: yield to the king's mercy in time; otherwise, if we enter perforce, no quarter
for such obstinate traitorly rogues.--From a Well-wisher." This conciliatory message was defiantly
answered in a prompt reply signed "Nicholas Cudgelyouwell;" and two days later, Prince Rupert
having suffered a defeat elsewhere, the Cavaliers abandoned the siege. Charles II., upon his
restoration, took care to have himself proclaimed with great pomp at Gloucester, and also took
the precaution to destroy its fortifications. The castle, which had stood since the days of
the Norman Conquest, then disappeared. The west gate, the last remains of the walls, was removed,
with the old bridge across the Severn, in 1809, to make room for a fine new bridge. This structure
is chiefly known through a humorous connection that Thackeray has given it with King George
III. That monarch made a royal visit to Gloucester, and in his lectures on the "Four Georges"

The town is quaint and picturesque, but the buildings generally are modern, most of them dating
from the days of good Queen Anne, but they exhibit great variety in design. The most noted
of the older Gloucester houses is the "New Inn," on Northgate Street. After the murder of Edward
II. at Berkeley Castle, not far from Gloucester, where he had been imprisoned in a dungeon
in the keep, in 1327, his remains were brought to the abbey church at Gloucester for interment,
a shrine being raised over them by the monks. The king was murdered with fiendish cruelty.
Lord Berkeley at the castle would willingly have protected him, but he fell sick; and one dark
September night Edward was given over to two villains named Gurney and Ogle. The ancient chronicler
says that the "screams and shrieks of anguish were heard even so far as the town, so that many,
being awakened therewith from their sleep, as they themselves confessed, prayed heartily to
God to receive his soul, for they understood by those cries what the matter meant." The king's
shrine in Gloucester naturally attracted many pilgrims, and the New Inn was built about 1450
for their accommodation. It is a brick-and-timber house, with corridors leading to the chambers
running along the sides of the inner court and reached by outside stairways, as was the common
construction of houses of public entertainment three or four centuries ago. The inn remains
almost as it was then, having been but slightly modernized. Most of the pilgrims to the shrine
brought offerings with them, and hence the pains taken for their accommodation. The usual tale
is told about a subterranean passage connecting this inn with the cathedral. New Inn is enormously
strong and massive, and covers a broad surface, being constructed around two courtyards.

Gloucester has many churches in proportion to its size--in fact, so many that "as sure as God
is in Gloucester" used to be a proverb. Oliver Cromwell, though the city had stood sturdily
by him, differed with this, however, for a saying of his is still quoted, that "there be more
churches than godliness in Gloucester." In later days the first Sunday-school in England was
opened here, and just outside the city are the fragmentary remains of the branch of Llanthony
Priory to which the monks migrated from the Welsh Border. The chief attraction of Gloucester,
however, is the cathedral, and the ruins of the Benedictine monastery to which it was formerly
attached. The cathedral is of considerable size, being four hundred and twenty feet long, and
is surmounted by a much-admired central tower. The light and graceful tracery of its parapets
and pinnacles gives especial character to the exterior of Gloucester Cathedral, and when the
open-work tracery is projected against the red glow of sunset an unrivalled effect is produced.
This tower is two hundred and twenty-five feet high, and forms an admirable centre to the masses
of buildings clustered around it. The monastery, founded by Osric in the seventh century, stood
on this site, but after the Danes burned it a convent was built, which passed into the hands
of the Benedictines in 1022. One of these monks was the "Robert of Gloucester" who in 1272
wrote in rhyme a chronicle of English history from the siege of Troy to the death of Henry
II. Their church was repeatedly burned and rebuilt, but it was not until the shrine of Edward
II. was placed in it that the religious establishment throve. The rich harvest brought by the
pilgrims to this shrine led to the reconstruction of the older church, by encasing the shell
with Perpendicular work in the lower part and completely rebuilding the upper portion. This
was in the fourteenth century, and by the close of the next century the cathedral appeared
as it is now seen. Entering the fine southern porch, we are ushered into the splendid Norman
nave bordered by exceptionally high piers, rising thirty feet, and surmounted by a low triforium
and clerestory. The design is rather dwarfed by thus impoverishing the upper stories. The choir
has an enormous east window, made wider than the choir itself by an ingenious arrangement of
the walls; and this retains most of the old stained glass. The choir has recently been restored,
and in the old woodwork the seat of the mayor is retained opposite the throne of the bishop.
On the floor an oblong setting of tiles marks the grave of William the Conqueror's son Robert,
who died at Cardiff, and whose monument stands in an adjoining chapel. The Lady Chapel is east
of the choir, and has a "whispering gallery" over its entrance. Beneath the choir is the crypt,
antedating the Norman Conquest, and one of the remains of the original church of the Benedictines.
On the south side of the choir is the monument to Edward II., standing in an archway. The effigy
is of alabaster, and is surmounted by a beautiful sculptured canopy. The cloisters north of
the nave are most attractive, the roof being vaulted in fan-patterns of great richness. There
can still be seen along the north walk of these cloisters the lavatories for the monks, with
the troughs into which the water flowed and the recesses in the wall above to contain the towels.
Beyond the cloisters are the other remains of the monastery, now generally incorporated into
houses. Gloucester has been a bishop's see since the reign of Henry VIII., and one of its bishops
was the zealous Reformer who was martyred in sight of his own cathedral--John Hooper: his statue
stands in St. Mary's Square, where Queen Mary had him burned as a heretic. Gloucester also
has its Spa, a chalybeate spring recently discovered in the south-eastern suburbs, but the
town is chiefly known to fame abroad by its salmon and lampreys. The lamprey is caught in the
Severn and potted for export, having been considered a dainty by the epicures of remote as
well as modern times. It was in great request in the time of King John, when we are told "the
men of Gloucester gave forty marks to that king to have his good will, because they regarded
him not as they ought in the matter of their lampreys." This was the favorite dish of Henry
I. (Beauclerc), and over-indulgence in lampreys finally killed him. It was the custom until
1836 for the corporation of Gloucester to send every Christmas to the sovereign "a lamprey
pie with a raised crust."

TEWKESBURY.

Let us ascend the valley of the Severn, and in the centre of its broad plain, at the confluence
of the Avon, find another great religious house in the smaller but equally noted town of Tewkesbury.
All around are rich meadows, and here, away from the hills, was the ideal site for a monastery
according to the ancient notion, where the languor of the gentle air prevented the blood flowing
with too quick pulse. The Avon, spanned by an old arched bridge, washes one side of the town;
the massive abbey-tower rises above a fringe of foliage and orchards, while on the one hand
the horizon is bounded by the steep Cotswolds, and on the other by the broken masses of the
Malverns. Close to the town, on its western verge, flows the Severn, crossed by a fine modern
iron bridge. Tewkesbury is known to fame by its mustard, its abbey, and its battle. The renown
of the Tewkesbury mustard goes back for at least three centuries: as "thick as Tewkesbury mustard"
was a proverb of Falstaff's. That old-time historian Fuller says of it, "The best in England
(to take no larger compass) is made at Tewkesbury. It is very wholesome for the clearing of
the head, moderately taken." But, unfortunately, the reputation of Tewkesbury for this commodity
has declined in modern times.

The history of Tewkesbury Abbey comes from misty antiquity, and it is thought by some to have
been named "Dukes-borough" from two ancient Britons, Dukes Odda and Dudda, but others say it
commemorates a missionary monk named Theoe, who founded a little church there in the seventh
century. Brictric, King of Wessex, was buried within its walls in the ninth century, and, like
Gloucester, it suffered afterwards from the ravages of the Danes. But it flourished subsequently,
and in the days of William Rufus the manor was conferred upon Fitz-Hamon, an influential nobleman,
under whose auspices the present abbey was built. Nothing remains of any prior building. The
church was begun in 1100, but the builder was killed in battle before it was completed. It
is in the form of a cross with short transepts, and a tower rising from the centre. The choir
was originally terminated by apses, which can still be traced, and there were other apses on
the eastern side of each transept. While the outlines of most of the abbey are Norman, the
choir is almost all of later date. The western front has the singular feature of being almost
all occupied by an enormous and deeply-recessed Norman arch, into which a doorway and tracery
were inserted about two hundred years ago, replacing one blown down by a storm in 1661. This
abbey church was dedicated in 1123, and the services were almost the last diocesan act of Theulf,
bishop of Worcester. One of the dedication ceremonies was quaint. As the bishop came to the
middle of the nave, we are told that he found part of the pavement spread with white wood-ashes,
upon which he wrote the alphabet twice with his pastoral staff--first the Greek alphabet from
north-east to south-west, and then the Latin, from south-east to north-west, thus placing them
in the form of a cross. He signified by this ceremony that all divine revelation was conveyed
by the letters of the alphabet, and that the gospel comprehended under the shadow of the cross
men of all races and all languages. The time had been when at such consecrations three alphabets
were written--the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin--as the title on the cross had been written in these
three tongues, but the Hebrew was early discontinued, "probably," writes Blunt, the historian
of Tewkesbury Abbey, "because even bishops might not always be able to manage their Alpha Beta
in that character." The best views of the abbey are from the south-east, and the interior is
regarded as more remarkable than the exterior. The nave is of singular grandeur, its round
Norman columns being exceptionally lofty. The triforium is stunted, and consists merely of
two pairs of small arches, above which the ribs of a noble fretted roof expand, so that it
appears as if the roof were immediately supported by the columns of the nave. The choir is
short and hexagonal, being only sixty-six feet from the reredos, and is surrounded by a number
of polygonal chapels, as at Westminster Abbey, with which it appears quite similar in plan.
The Lady Chapel, originally at the east end, has been entirely destroyed. There are several
monuments of great interest in these chapels, some of them in the form of chantries--being
exquisite cages in stone-work--within which are the tombs of the founders. Here lie some of
the chief nobility of England who in the days of the Plantagenets were the lords of Tewkesbury--the
Beauchamps, Nevilles, De Clares, and Despensers. Fitz-Hamon's tomb was not erected until the
fourteenth century. Here lie Clarence and his wife, Isabel, the daughter of Warwick the "King-maker,"
and also the murdered son of Henry VI., who was "stabbed in the field by Tewkesbury," with
other victims of that fatal battle. The remains of the cloisters lie to the south of the abbey,
and beyond is the ancient gateway, of rather unusual plan.

The battle of Tewkesbury, which sealed the fate of the Lancastrian party in England, was fought
in 1471 upon the Bloody Meadow, then called the Vineyard, just outside the town and to the
southward of the abbey. The Lancastrian line was soon broken, and the fight became practically
a slaughter, as the defeated party were forced back upon the town and into the very abbey itself.
Many of the fugitives sought refuge in the church, and the Yorkists followed them, striking
down their victims in the graveyard, and even within the church-doors. The abbot, taking in
his hand the sacred Host, confronted King Edward himself in the porch and forbade him to pollute
the house of God with blood, and would not allow him to enter until he had promised mercy to
those who had sought refuge inside. This clemency, however, was short-lived, for in the afternoon
the young Prince of Wales, Henry VI.'s son, was brought before Edward and murdered by his attendants.
Shakespeare represents Edward as dealing the first blow with a dagger, but the truer story
seems to be that, enraged by a haughty answer from the young prince, he struck him in the face
with his gauntlet, which the bystanders accepted as a signal for the murder. Two days afterwards
a number of the chief captives were executed.

WORCESTER.

Still ascending the valley of the Severn, we come to Worcester, another of the military stations
of the Romans, established to hold this rich, fertile, and coveted region. Its cathedral, and,
in fact, much of the town, stand upon an elevated ridge, with the river flowing at the base.
To this day Worcester retains the plan of the original Roman camp, but it does not seem to
have made at that time much mark in history. The Britons captured it, and named the place Wigoma
Ceaster, and it was afterwards incorporated into Mercia. In the eleventh century a castle was
built near the Severn, and the earlier kings of England were frequently its residents. King
John had great veneration for St. Wulstan, the founder of Worcester Cathedral, and he was laid
to rest beside that saint's shrine. Worcester suffered the usual penalties of the towns in
the Severn Valley: it was destroyed by the Danes and burned by Hardicanute, and in the twelfth
century town, castle, and cathedral were all consumed by a fire supposed to be caused by the
Welsh. It was partially burned three times subsequently in that century, and in Henry III.'s
reign Simon de Montfort and his son were defeated and slain on the neighboring hills. The final
conflagration was caused by Owen Glendower in 1401, after which quieter times came until the
Civil War. Worcester was zealous for King Charles, and suffered from two sieges, being the
last city that held out for the royal cause. It was the scene of Charles II.'s first and unsuccessful
effort to regain the English crown. He had been acknowledged and crowned by the Scots, and
attempted the invasion of England. His army marched down through the western counties, while
Cromwell kept between him and London. He reached Worcester, when Cromwell determined to attack
him, and marched the Parliamentary army to the outskirts of the city, encamping on Red Hill,
where he intrenched. Sending part of his troops across the Severn, on September 3, 1651, Cromwell
attacked Worcester on both sides, leading the van of the main body in person. Young Charles
held a council of war in the cathedral-tower, and when he descended to personally lead the
defence, the fight had become hot; and it lasted several hours, Cromwell describing the battle
as being "as stiff a contest as I have ever seen." The Scots were outnumbered and beaten, but
would not surrender, and the battle did not close till nightfall. Then it was found that, while
Cromwell had suffered inconsiderable loss, the royal forces had lost six thousand men and all
their artillery and baggage. Charles fought bravely, and narrowly avoided capture. A handful
of troops defended Sidbury Gate, leading in from the suburb of the town where the battle had
been hottest. Charles had to dismount and creep under an overturned hay-wagon, and, entering
the gate, mounted a horse and rode to the corn-market, where he escaped with Lord Wilmot through
the back door of a house, while some of his officers beat off Cobbett's troops who attacked
the front. Upon this house, built in 1557, is still read the inscription, "Love God; honor
the king." Then getting out of the city, Charles escaped into the wood of Boscobel, and after
a series of romantic adventures managed to reach the seacoast in Sussex, and on October 15th
embarked at Shoreham for France. It was in this battle that Worcester earned the motto it still
bears of "Civitas fidelis."

Worcester's most conspicuous building is the cathedral, its tower being prominently seen from
miles around. Its western front overlooks the Severn, and the ground-plan is an elongated rectangle
with small double transepts. The choir and portions of the nave are the original work, most
of the remainder being restored. St. Dunstan's successor, Bishop Oswald, built the first cathedral
here, and during the progress of the work he met an unexpected check. The ancient chronicler
tells us that a large stone became immovable, and despite every exertion could not be brought
to its proper place. "St. Oswald," he continues, "after praying earnestly, beheld 'Ethiopem
quendam' sitting upon the stone and mocking the builders: the sign of the cross removed him
effectually." No portion of this original building remains, the earliest parts of the present
cathedral dating from Bishop Wulstan's time, in the eleventh century. Wulstan was a man of
piety and simplicity who retained his see after the Norman Conquest. The increasing number
of monks in the monastery compelled the removal of Oswald's church to make more room, and Wulstan
regretfully built the new cathedral, saying he was pulling down the church of a far holier
man than himself. Miracles were frequent at Wulstan's tomb, and in 1203 he was canonized. His
church was unlucky--several times partly burned, and once the central tower fell, and afterwards
the two western towers during storms; but it was always repaired, and in 1218, St. Wulstan's
remains were removed to a shrine near the high altar, and the cathedral rededicated in the
presence of Henry III. The interior view is striking, the arches of the nave, triforium, and
clerestory being in harmonious proportions. In the middle of the choir is King John's monument,
the effigy representing him crowned and in royal robes, holding the sceptre and the sword,
the point of the latter inserted in the mouth of a lion on which his feet rest. We are told
that in 1797 the coffin was found beneath the tomb, with the apparel partially mouldered, but
the remains all gone. There are several other monuments in the cathedral--one a mural slab
commemorating Anne, wife of Izaak Walton, "a woman of remarkable prudence and of the primitive
piety." The crypt beneath the choir is a remnant of Wulstan's work, and the old doors of the
cathedral, dating from the thirteenth century, are preserved there: fragments of human skin
are still seen upon them, reputed to have been that of a man who was flayed for stealing a
holy bell. In the north walk of the cloisters is the grave-slab famous for bearing the shortest
and saddest inscription in England, "Miserrimus:" it is said to cover one of the minor canons,
named Morris, who declined to take the oath of allegiance to William III. and had to be supported
by alms. Around the cloisters are the ruins of the ancient monastery, the most prominent fragments
being those of the Guesten Hall, erected in 1320. Access to the cathedral close, on the south-eastern
side, is obtained through an ancient gateway called the Edgar Tower, one of the earliest structures
connected with the cathedral, which is still fairly preserved: it was evidently intended for
defence. The bishops of Worcester present an unbroken line for twelve centuries, including,
in later days, Latimer the martyr, Prideaux, and Stillingfleet. It was in Worcester Cathedral,
on October 23, 1687, that James II. touched several persons to cure the scrofula or king's
evil; and when William III. afterwards visited Worcester he yielded to sundry entreaties to
touch sufferers, but in doing so said, "God give you better health and more sense!" These were
about the last "touchings" known in England. Upon James II.'s visit he attended mass at the
Catholic chapel, and was waited upon to the door by the mayor and corporation officers, but
they declined to enter a Roman Catholic place of worship. A minute in the corporation proceedings
explains that they passed the time until the service was over in smoking and drinking at the
Green Dragon Inn, loyally charging the bill to the city. Worcester in ancient times was famous
for its cloth, but other places have since eclipsed it. It is now noted mainly for gloves,
fine porcelain, and Worcester Sauce.

THE MALVERN HILLS.

The broad valley of the Severn is bounded on its western side by the boldly-rising Malvern
range of hills, which are elevated so steeply and so suddenly above the plain that they produce
an impression of size and height much greater than they really possess, and are more imposing
than many summits that far surpass them in magnitude. There is reason, therefore, in Mrs. Browning's
poetic expression:

  "Malvern Hills, for mountains counted
  Not unduly, form a row."

The Malvern range is a ridge running nearly north and south, with a series of smooth, steep
summits, the breadth of the range being barely half a mile. Their slopes are of turf and furze,
often as steep as the pitched roof of a house, with crags projecting here and there. The chief
summits are the North Hill, rising eleven hundred and fifty-one feet above the Severn, the
Worcestershire Beacon, fourteen hundred and forty-four feet, and the Herefordshire Beacon,
thirteen hundred and seventy feet. Their highest parts are covered with verdure, and nearly
seventeen hundred different varieties of plants have been found on the range. These hills stand
as one of Nature's bulwarks, an outwork of the mountain-region of Wales, dividing an upland
from a lowland district, each furnishing totally different characteristics. They were the boundary
between the Romans and the Britons, and their summits present some remarkable remains of ancient
fortifications. The Worcestershire Beacon rises directly above the town of Great Malvern, and
south of it a fissure called the Wyche sinks down to about nine hundred feet elevation, enabling
a road to be carried across the ridge. Some distance south of this there is an even lower depression,
by which the high-road crosses from Worcester to Hereford. Then to the southward is the Herefordshire
Beacon, and beyond it several lower summits. These two gaps or gateways in this natural wall
of defence are both guarded by ancient camps of unusual strength and still in good preservation.
One of these camps on the Herefordshire Beacon, with ditches, ramparts, and a keep, encloses
forty-four acres. Also on top of the ridge are found traces of the ditch that was dug to mark
the dividing-lines between the hunting-grounds of the bishops who ruled on either hand in Hereford
and in Worcester. The bishops in the olden time appear to have been as keen sportsmen as the
nobles.

The town of Great Malvern, on the eastern slope of the hills, is elevated five hundred and
twenty feet, and is in high repute as a watering-place. It had its origin in a priory, of which
there still remains the fine old church, with a surmounting gray tower and an entrance-gateway
which have escaped the general ruin of the monastery. Within this ancient church the ornaments
of some of the old stalls in the choir are very quaint, representing a man leading a bear,
a dying miser handing his money-bags to the priest and doctor, and three rats solemnly hanging
a cat on a gallows. The priory was the nucleus about which gathered the town, or, properly
speaking, the towns, for there are a series of them, all well-known watering-places. Great
Malvern has North Malvern alongside it and Malvern Link on the lower hills, while to the southward
are Malvern Wells and Little Malvern, with West Malvern over on the Hereford side of the ridge.
They are aggregations of pretty villas, and the many invalids who seek their relief are drawn
about in Bath-chairs by little donkeys. The view from the Worcestershire Beacon is grand, extending
over a broad surface in all directions, for we are told that when the beacon-fires that were
lighted upon this elevated ridge warned England of the approach of the Spanish Armada,

  "Twelve fair counties saw the blaze
    From Malvern's lonely height."

The advantages the Malvern range offers as a sanitarium are pure air and pure water. The towns
are elevated above the fogs of the valleys, and the rainfall is small, while both winter's
cold and summer's heat are tempered. St. Anne's Well and the Holy Well are the great sources
of pure water. The latter is at Malvern Wells, and the former on the side of the Worcestershire
Beacon, at an elevation of eight hundred and twenty feet. Both are slightly alkaline, but St.
Anne's Well is the most famous, and is tastefully enclosed. Water-cure establishments abound
here, and with such air, such water, and such magnificent scenery it is no wonder that the
Malvern Hills are among the most popular resorts of England.

THE RIVER WYE.

From the top of the Malvern Hills the western view looks down upon the attractive valley of
the river Wye, a famous stream that takes its rise in the mountains of Wales, and after flowing
through Herefordshire and Monmouthshire falls into the Severn. Rising on the south-eastern
side of Plynlimmon, a group of three mountains elevated nearly twenty-five hundred feet, it
is one of five rivers whose sources are almost in the same spot, but which flow in opposite
directions--the Llyffnant, Rheidol, Dyfi, Severn, and Wye. For miles it is a mountain torrent,
receiving other streams, and flowing eastward through Radnor and Brecknock, where it is the
resort of artists and anglers. It passes near the burial-place of Llewellyn, the last native
Prince of Wales, who died in 1282, and then, bordered by railway and highway, comes down through
picturesque ravines past Hay and its ruined castle in a beautiful glen at the base of the Black
Mountains, which rise abruptly from its southern bank. Near Hay, and overlooking the river,
are the ruins of Clifford Castle, which was the birthplace of "Fair Rosamond." Here the Wye
enters Herefordshire, the valley broadens, and the stream gradually leads us to the ancient
town of Hereford, standing chiefly on its northern bank and in a delightful situation. This
city does not lay claim to Roman origin, but it was nevertheless one of the fortified outposts
of England on the border of Wales, and was often the scene of warfare. It was walled and vigorously
defended, while hostelries and chapels were erected for the accommodation of pilgrims and other
visitors. Hereford contained the shrines of St. Ethelbert and St. Thomas Cantelupe, but its
chief relic of antiquity is the house that remains of the "old Butchers' Row," which was originally
a large and irregular cluster of wooden buildings placed nearly in the middle of the locality
known as the High Town. All but one of these houses have been taken down, and the one that
remains shows window-frames, doors, stairs, and floors all made of thick and solid masses of
timber, apparently constructed to last for ages. A shield over one of the doors bears a boar's
head and three bulls' heads, having two winged bulls for supporters and another bull for a
crest. On other parts are emblems of the slaughter-house, such as ropes, rings, and axes. Thus
did our English ancestors caricature the imaginary dignity of heraldry. This attractive old
house is a relic of the days of James I. Nell Gwynne was born in Hereford, and the small cottage
in Pipe Lane which was her birthplace has only recently been pulled down. It was a little four-roomed
house, and an outhouse opening on the Wye, which was standing in poor Nelly's days, remains.
Hereford Cathedral is a fine Norman structure, begun in the eleventh century and recently restored.
The most imposing portion of the interior is the north transept, which was built to receive
the shrine of Cantelupe. The remains of the Black Friars' monastery are in the Widemarsh suburb.
They consist chiefly of an interesting relic of that religious order, an hexagonal preaching-cross
standing on a flight of steps and open on each side. Hereford Castle has disappeared, but its
site is an attractive public walk overlooking the Wye, called the Castle Green.

THE MAN OF ROSS.

The Wye flows on through a fairly open valley, with broad meadows extending from the bases
of the wooded hills to the river. On approaching Ross the meadows contract, the hills come
nearer together, and the new phase of scenery in the glen which here begins makes the Wye the
most beautiful among English rivers. Ross stands at the entrance to the glen, built upon a
sloping hill which descends steeply to the Wye. It was the Ariconium of the Romans, and has
been almost without stirring history. It has grown in all these centuries to be a town of about
four thousand five hundred population, with considerable trade, being the centre of a rich
agricultural section, and is chiefly known to fame as the home of Pope's "Man of Ross." This
was John Kyrle, who was born at the village of Dymock, not far away, May 22, 1637. He was educated
at Balliol College, Oxford, where they still preserve a piece of plate which he presented as
a parting gift. He afterwards settled at Ross, and lived to an advanced age, dying November
11, 1724. He was described as "nearly six feet high, strong and lusty made, jolly and ruddy
in the face, with a large nose." His claim to immortality, which has made his name a household
word in England, cannot better be described than by quoting some of Pope's lines:

  "Who hung with woods yon mountain's sultry brow?
  From the dry soil who bade the waters flow?...
  Whose causeway parts the vale with shady rows?
  Whose seats the weary traveller repose?
  Behold the market-place with poor o'erspread!
  The Man of Ross divides the weekly bread:
  He feeds yon almshouse, neat, but void of state,
  Where age and want sit smiling at the gate:
  Him portioned maids, apprenticed orphans blest,
  The young who labor, and the old who rest.
  Is any sick? The Man of Ross relieves.
  Prescribes, attends, the med'cine makes and gives.
  Is there a variance? Enter but his door.
  Balked are the courts and contest is no more....
  Thrice happy man! enabled to pursue
  What all so wish, but want the power to do!
  Oh say what sums that generous hand supply,
  What mines to swell that boundless charity?
  Of debts and taxes, wife and children, clear.
  That man possessed--five hundred pounds a year!"

It is not often that a man can do so much to benefit his townsfolk out of the modest income
of $2500 a year; and not only Pope, but Coleridge also, has found this a theme for verse. The
house in which the "Man of Ross" lived is on the left-hand side of the market-place, and still
stands, though much changed. It is now a drug-store and a dwelling. The floors and panelling
of several of the chambers are of oak, while a quaint opening leads to a narrow corridor and
into a small room, which tradition says was his bedroom, where he endured his last and only
illness, and died. The bedroom looks out upon his garden, divided like the house, one-half
being converted into a bowling-green. The surrounding walls are overrun with vines and bordered
by pear trees. On the other side of the market-place is the town-hall, standing on an eminence
and facing the principal street, which comes up from the river-bank. This hall is somewhat
dilapidated, though still in daily use, and is supported on crumbling pillars of red sandstone.
Ross is chiefly built upon the slope of a hill, terminating in a plateau, one side of which
the Wye, flowing through a horseshoe bend, has scarped out into a river-cliff. Upon this plateau
stands the little Ross Church with its tall spire, a striking building in a singularly fortunate
situation. The churchyard, with an adjoining public garden called the Prospect, extends to
the brow of the cliff. The church is cruciform, and its spire the landmark for the surrounding
country. It was built in the fourteenth century, but is without architectural features. The
"Man of Ross" rests within its walls, buried near the altar under a blue slab. His memory is
the most cherished remembrance of Ross, and is mellowed as the ages pass. His fireside chair
stands in the chancel, and they also show a book containing his autograph. A tablet to his
memory is inserted in the wall, erected by a distant relative, Lady Betty Dupplin, for it is
said, as is usually the case, that his good deeds excited more enthusiasm in strangers than
among the people whom he benefited. Within the church, in front of a window, two trees are
growing, another indirect and posthumous memorial of the "Man of Ross." They appeared about
fifty years ago, and the story is that a rector of the parish had cut down a tree on the outside
of the wall which the "Man of Ross" had originally planted, whereupon these suckers made their
appearance within the building and asserted the vitality of the parent tree. They shot up against
the seat which is said to have been his favorite one, and though at first objected to, the
church-wardens bowed to the inevitable, and they are now among the most prized relics within
the church. The public garden (the Prospect) adjoining the churchyard was another benefaction
of the "Man of Ross," and with some private houses and a hotel it crowns the summit of the
plateau. Here the hand of the "Man of Ross" again appears in a row of noble elms around the
churchyard which he is said to have planted, some of them of great size. The view from the
Prospect, however, is the town's chief present glory. It stands on the brink of the river-cliff,
with the Wye sweeping at its feet around the apex of the long horseshoe curve. Within the curve
is the grassy Oak Meadow dotted with old trees. On either hand are meadows and cornfields,
with bits of wood, and the Welsh hills rise in the distance.

GOODRICH CASTLE AND SYMOND'S YAT.

The Wye flows on through its picturesque glen towards Monmouth, the water bubbling with a strong
current. A raised causeway carries the road to Monmouth over the meadows. On the right hand
are the ruins of Wilton Castle, built in Stephen's reign, and burned in the Civil War. Tourists
go by small boats floated on the current down the Wye, and the boats are hauled back on donkey-carts,
little trains of them being seen creeping along the Monmouth road. From Ross to Monmouth the
river flows through a region of rolling hills, with abrupt declivities where the rapid stream
has scarped the margin into cliffs and ridges. The valley narrows, and the very crooked river
flows through bewitching scenery until by another great horseshoe bend it winds around the
ruins of Goodrich Castle, reared upon a wooded cliff, with Goodrich Court near by. The latter
is a modern imitation of a mediæval dwelling, constructed according to the erratic whims of
a recent owner. This Court once contained the finest collection of ancient armor in England,
but most of it has been transferred to the South Kensington Museum. Goodrich Castle was once
a formidable fortress, and it dates from the reign of Stephen. Here it was that in the days
of Edward the Confessor, "entrenched in a stockade of wood, Goderic de Winchcomb held the ford"
over the Wye, and gave the place his name. It grew in strength until the Civil War, when Sir
Richard Lingen held it for the king. This was a memorable contest, lasting six weeks, during
which the besiegers belabored it with the best battering-cannon they could procure, and used
up eighty barrels of gunpowder voted by Parliament for the purpose. Then the defenders demanded
a parley, but the assailants, angry at being so long baulked of their prey, insisted upon unconditional
surrender. Afterwards the castle was demolished, but the fine old keep remains in good preservation,
commanding a grand view over the winding valley of the Wye and to the Forest of Dean in one
direction and the Malvern Hills in another. The ruins are of a quadrangular fortress, and within
the courtyard Wordsworth once met the child whose prattle suggested his familiar poem, "We
are Seven." Little now remains of Goodrich Priory, but the parish church of the village can
be seen afar off, and contains a chalice presented by Dean Swift, whose grandfather, Thomas
Swift, was once its rector.

Below Goodrich this wayward river makes an enormous loop, wherein it goes wandering about for
eight miles and accomplishes just one mile's distance. Here it becomes a boundary between the
two Bickner villages--Welsh Bickner and English Bickner. To the eastward is the Forest of Dean,
covering over twenty-six thousand acres, and including extensive coal-pits and iron-works,
the smoke from the latter overhanging the valley. The river-channel is dug deeply into the
limestone rocks, whose fissured and ivy-clad cliffs rise high above the water, varied by occasional
green meadows, where cattle are feeding. The river bends sharply to the westward past the crags
at Coldwell, and then doubles back upon its former course. This second bend is around a high
limestone plateau which is the most singular feature of the beautiful glen. The river sweeps
in an elongated loop of about five miles, and returns to within eighteen hundred feet of its
former channel, and the plateau rises six hundred feet to the apex of the headland that mounts
guard over the grand curve--the famous Symond's Yat. On the top are the remains of an ancient
British fort, and rocks, woods, fields, and meadows slope down to the river on almost every
side, making a bewitching scene. It was here that the Northman Vikings in 911 fortified themselves
after they landed on the Severn and penetrated through the Forest of Dean. They were led by
Eric in quest of plunder, and captured a bishop, who was afterwards ransomed for two hundred
dollars. Their foray roused the people, who besieged the Vikings, forming a square encampment
which commanded their fortification, and remains of which are still visible. They drove the
Vikings out with their hail of arrows, and punished them so terribly that the defile down which
they fled is still known as "The Slaughter." The remnant who escaped afterwards surrendered
on condition of being allowed to quit the country, and their experience had such wholesome
influence that no Vikings came that way afterwards.

The Wye next bends around two bold limestone hills known as the Great and the Little Doward,
each surmounted by ancient encampments, where arrowheads and other relics, not to forget the
bones of a giant, have been found. In fact, bones seem to be a prolific product of this region,
for the "bone-caves" of the Dowards produce the relics of many animals long vanished from the
kingdom, and also disclose rude weapons of flint, showing that the primitive races of men were
here with them. Beds of stalagmites, sand, and gravel covered these relics, deposited by an
ancient stream which geologists say flowed three hundred feet above the present bed of the
Wye. Then we come to the richly-wooded deer-park of the Leys with its exquisite views, and
here the wildly romantic scenery is gradually subdued into a more open valley and a straighter
stream as the Wye flows on towards Monmouth. The parts of the river just described are not
more renowned for their beauty, though considered the finest in England, than for their salmon,
and we are told that three men with a net have been known to catch a ton of salmon in a day,
while the fishery-rights are let at over $100,000 annually.

MONMOUTH.

The beautiful valley, with its picturesque scenery, expands somewhat as the Wye approaches
its junction with the river Monnow and flows through a succession of green meadows. Here, between
the two rivers on a low spur, a prolongation of their bordering hills, stands Monmouth, its
ancient suburbs spreading across the Monnow. From the market-place, the chief street of the
town leads down to these suburbs, crossing over an old-time bridge. The town has its church
and the ruins of a priory, while perched on a cliff overlooking the Monnow is its castle, displaying
rather extensive but not very attractive remains. John of Monmouth is said to have built this
castle in the reign of Henry III. Here also lived at one time John of Gaunt and his son, Harry
Hereford, who afterwards became Henry IV., and the latter's son, Harry Monmouth, was born in
this old castle, growing up to become the wild "Prince Hal," and afterwards the victor at Agincourt.
They still show a narrow window, with remains of tracery, as marking the room in which he first
saw the light. Thus has "Prince Hal" become the patron of Monmouth, and his statue stands in
front of the town-hall, representing the king in full armor, and inscribed, "Henry V., born
at Monmouth August 9, 1387," but it is not regarded as remarkable for its artistic finish.
The remains of the old priory are utilized for a school. It was founded by the Benedictines
in the reign of Henry I., and in it lived Geoffrey of Monmouth, a familiar author in days when
books were few. He was Bishop of St. Asaph's in the year 1152, and wrote his History of the
Britons, wherein he combined all the fables of the time so ingeniously with the truth that
they became alike history. Out of his imagination grew the tale of the "Round Table" and its
knights.

Upon the old bridge crossing the Monnow stands an ancient gate-house, constructed in the style
that prevailed in the thirteenth century, but it is doubtful if this was a military work, its
probable use being the collection of tolls on the produce brought into the town. It is pierced
with postern arches for the foot-passengers, and still retains the place for its portcullis.
All around the Monmouth market-place are the old houses where the celebrated Monmouth caps
were made that were so popular in old times, and of which Fluellen spoke when he told Henry
V., "If Your Majesty is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks
did grow, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps." Monmouth is not a large town, having but six
thousand inhabitants, but it takes a mayor, four aldermen, two bailiffs, and twelve councillors
to govern them, and its massive county-jail is a solid warning to all evil-doers. From the
summit of the lofty Kymin Hill, rising seven hundred feet on the eastern side of the town,
there is a grand panorama over the valley of the Wye. This hill is surmounted by a pavilion
and temple, built in 1800 to record the naval victories of England in the American wars. Farther
down the valley was the home of the late Lord Raglan, and here are the ruins of Raglan Castle,
built in the fifteenth century. For ten weeks in the Civil War the venerable Marquis of Worcester
held this castle against Fairfax's siege, but the redoubtable old hero, who was aged eighty-four,
ultimately had to surrender.

TINTERN ABBEY AND CHEPSTOW CASTLE.

The Wye at Monmouth also receives the Trothy River, and the confluence of the three valleys
makes a comparatively open basin, which, however, again narrows into another romantic glen
a short distance below the town. Wild woods border the steep hills, and the Wye flows through
the western border of the Forest of Dean, an occasional village attesting the mineral wealth
by its blackened chimneys. Here, below Redbrook, was the home of Admiral Rooke, who captured
Gibraltar in 1704, and farther down are the ruins of the castle of St. Briard, built in the
days of Henry I. to check Welsh forays. Here lived the lord warden of the Forest of Dean, and
for three centuries every Whit-Sunday they held the annual "scramble" in the church. It appears
that a tax of one penny was levied on every person who pastured his cattle on the common, and
the amount thus raised was expended for bread and cheese. The church was crowded, and the clerk
standing in the gallery threw out the edibles to the struggling congregation below. The railway
closely hugs the swiftly-flowing river in its steep and narrow glen as we pass Offa's Dyke
and Chair and the Moravian village of Brockweir. Here the line of fortifications crossed the
valley which the king of Mercia constructed to protect his dominions. The valley then slightly
expands, and the green sward is dotted by the houses of the long and scattered village of Tintern
Parva. The river sharply bends, and in the glen on the western side stand the ruins of the
far-famed Tintern Abbey in the green meadows at the brink of the Wye. The spot is well chosen,
for nowhere along this celebrated river has Nature indicated a better place for quiet, heavenly
meditation not un-mixed with earthly comforts.

Walter de Clare founded Tintern Abbey in 1131 for the Cistercian monks, and dedicated it to
St. Mary. It was built upon an ancient battlefield where a Christian prince of Glamorgan had
been slain by the heathen, but of the buildings erected by De Clare none now exist, the present
remains being of later date, and the abbey church that is now in ruin was erected by Roger
Bigod, Duke of Norfolk. It is a magnificent relic of the Decorated period. The vaulted roof
and central tower are gone, but the arches which supported the latter remain. The row of columns
on the northern side of the nave have fallen, with the clerestory above them, but the remainder
of the structure has suffered little damage. The western front, with its noble window and exquisite
tracery, is very fine. Ivy and ferns overrun the walls and form a coping, while green sward
has replaced the pavement, so that it would be difficult to imagine a more enchanting ruin,
and as such Tintern is renowned the world over. Lord Houghton has written:

  "The men who called their passion piety,
  And wrecked this noble argosy of faith,--
  They little thought how beauteous could be death,
  How fair the face of time's aye-deepening sea,
  Nor arms that desolate, nor years that flee,
  Nor hearts that fail, can utterly deflower
  This grassy floor of sacramental power
  Where we now stand communicants."

Tintern Abbey is two hundred and twenty-eight feet long. It had no triforium, and the clerestory
windows are rather large. The great east window was even more elaborate than the western, but
all of it has fallen excepting the central mullion and the stronger portion of the tracery
which branches out on either side from it. There yet remain in the building a few tiles with
heraldic emblems, some broken monuments, and some heaps of choice carvings, shattered as they
fell, but afterwards collected and piled against the walls. The Duke of Beaufort, to whose
estate it belongs, has done everything possible to arrest decay, and all is kept in perfect
order. A door leads out of the southern transept to a few fragments of buildings in the fields
on that side, but most of the convent was on the northern side, where its ruins surround a
grass-grown quadrangle. A cloister once ran around it; on the eastern side is the chapter-house,
with the dormitory above, and on the western side the remains of the abbot's lodgings and the
guest-chambers have been converted into cottages. The refectory and guest-hall are to the northward,
with ruins of the octagonal columns that supported the roof. Such is this magnificent relic
of the Cistercians, and yet it is but one of seventy-six abbeys that they possessed before
Henry VIII. dissolved them. From the high-road down the valley of the Wye, which skirts the
green meadows along its southern face, is the best view of the abbey, and the ruddy gray stone
ruins, with the grassy fields and the background of wooded hills beyond the broad river, make
up a picture that cannot easily be forgotten. Yet Tintern is most beautiful of all when the
full moon rising over the eastern hills pours a flood of light through the broken east window
to the place where once stood the high altar.

The valley of the Wye again broadens, and the river flows in graceful curves through the meadows,
guarded on either hand by cliffs and woods. The river is here a tidal-stream, having a rise
of twelve feet, so that it is now a strong current, flowing full and swift between grassy banks,
and anon is a shrunken creek, fringed by broad borders of mud. The railway on the eastern bank
runs over the meadows and through occasional tunnels in the spurs of the cliffs. The high-road
climbs the hill on the western bank, known as the Wynecliff, from the top of which there is
a grand view over the valley and to the southward towards and beyond Chepstow. This cliff rises
nine hundred feet above the river, and is the great monarch of a realm of crags that poke up
their heads in all directions. Across the Wye, on a tongue of land projecting into the stream,
Sir John Wyntour in the Civil War, with one hundred and eighty Royalists, hastily built a fort
to command the river. Before their intrenchments were complete the enemy in superior force
attacked and completely routed them; but twenty escaped, and Wyntour, cutting his way through
the assailants' lines, took refuge in the beetling crags behind known as the Tidenham Rocks.
The cavalry pursued him, when he forced his horse down a part somewhat less precipitous than
the rest, reached the bank in safety, and escaped by swimming his horse over the river. The
precipice is still known as Wyntour's Leap. Below, the Wye flows through Chepstow, with iron
bridges spanning it to carry the road and railway across. The main part of the town on the
western part is built upon a slope that in places descends somewhat rapidly to the river. Parts
of the old walls are still preserved, strengthened at intervals by round towers. Chepstow has
its ruined church, once a priory, within which Henry Marten the regicide was buried after twenty
years' imprisonment in the castle.

The great point of interest is Chepstow Castle, built here to command the Wye, and standing
in a fine situation on the edge of the river in a naturally fortified position. Upon the land-side
deep trenches and outworks protect it, while a grassy meadow intervenes between its gateway
and the Wye, that here makes a sharp curve. To get the castle in between the crags and the
river, it was constructed upon a long and narrow plan, and is divided into four courts. The
main entrance on the eastern side is through a ponderous gateway flanked by solid towers and
with curiously-constructed ancient wooden doors. Entering the court, there is a massive tower
on the left hand with an exterior staircase turret, while on the right the custodian lives
in a group of comparatively modern buildings, beneath which is a vaulted chamber communicating
with the river. Within this tower, whose walls are of great thickness, Henry Marten was imprisoned.
He was one of the court that tried King Charles, and his signature is upon the king's death-warrant.
He was a spendthrift, and afterwards had a quarrel with Cromwell, who denounced him as an unbeliever,
and even as a buffoon. When Charles II. made the proclamation of amnesty, Marten surrendered,
but he was tried and condemned to death. He plead that he came in under the proffer of mercy,
and the sentence was commuted to a life imprisonment; and after a short confinement in the
Tower of London he was removed to Chepstow, where he died twenty years later, in 1680. Passing
into the smaller second court, for the rocks contract it, there is a strong tower protecting
its entrance, and at the upper end are the ruins of the great hall, relics of the fourteenth
century. Two or three windows, a door, and part of an arcade remain, but roof and floor are
gone. A still smaller court lies beyond, at the upper end of which is a gateway defended by
a moat, beyond which is the western gate and court of the castle, so that this last enclosure
forms a kind of barbican. Chepstow was elaborately defended, and its only vulnerable points
were from the meadows on the east and the higher ground to the west; but before the days of
artillery it was regarded as impregnable, and excellently performed its duty as a check upon
the Welsh. Fitzosbern, Earl of Hereford, built the older parts in the eleventh century, but
the most of Chepstow dates from that great epoch of castle-building on the Welsh border, the
reign of Edward I. We are told that the second Fitzosbern was attainted and his estates forfeited,
but that the king one Easter graciously sent to him in prison his royal robes. The earl so
disdained the favor that he burned them, which made the king so angry that he said, "Certainly
this is a very proud man who hath thus abused me, but, by the brightness of God, he shall never
come out of prison so long as I live." Whereupon, says Dugdale, who tells the tale, he remained
a prisoner until he died. Chepstow was then bestowed upon the De Clares, who founded Tintern
Abbey, and it afterwards passed by marriage to the Bigod family. Chepstow in the Civil War
was held for the king, and surrendered to the Parliamentary troops. Soon afterwards it was
surprised at the western gate and retaken. Cromwell then besieged it, but, the siege proving
protracted, he left Colonel Ewer in charge. The Royalist garrison of about one hundred and
sixty men were reduced to great extremity and tried to escape by a boat, but in this they were
disappointed, as one of the besiegers, watching his opportunity, swam across the Wye with a
knife in his teeth and cut the boat adrift. Then the castle was assaulted and taken, and the
commander and most of the garrison slain. Parliament gave it to Cromwell, but after the Restoration
it was returned to the heirs of the Marquis of Worcester, its owner, and it still belongs to
his descendant, the Duke of Beaufort. The neighborhood of Chepstow has many pleasant villas
in beautiful sites, and the broadening Wye flows a short distance beyond through the meadow-land,
and then debouches into the estuary of the Severn.

THE GOLDEN VALLEY.

Still journeying westward beyond the beautiful valley of the Wye, we will ascend its tributary,
the Monnow, to its sources in the Black Mountains on the borders of Wales. We skirted along
the northern side of these mountains with the Wye, while the Monnow takes us fairly into them.
The little river Dore is one of the head-waters of the Monnow, and it flows through the picturesque
region known as the Golden Valley, just on the edge of Brecon, where the trout-fishing is as
attractive as the scenery. All its streams rise upon the flanks of the Black Mountains, and
the village of Pontrilas is its railway-station at the entrance to the valley. This village
is devoted to the manufacture of naphtha, for which purpose mules bring wood from the neighboring
forests, and it was once honored with the presence of a hotel. This was its principal mansion,
Pontrilas Court, but it has long since been converted into a private residence. This court
is a characteristic Elizabethan mansion, standing in a beautiful garden almost smothered in
foliage and running vines. About a mile up the valley is the pretty village of Ewias Harold,
with its church on one sloping bank of the little river and its castle on the other. Within
the church alongside the chancel there is a recumbent female figure holding a casket in its
hands. The tomb upon which it is placed was some time ago opened, but nothing was found within
excepting a case containing a human heart. The monument probably commemorates an unknown benefactress
whose corpse lies elsewhere, but who ordered her heart sent to the spot she loved best. The
castle, standing on an eminence, was once a strong fortress, and tradition says it was built
by Harold before he was king, but it does not occupy a prominent place in history. Ascending
a hill to the northward, a view is obtained over the valleys of the three picturesque streams--the
Dore, Dulas, and Monnow--that afterwards unite their waters; and, proceeding up the Dore, we
come to the village of Abbey Dore, with the roofless ruins of its abbey, a part of which is
utilized for the parish church, though scarcely anything is now left beyond fragments of the
conventual buildings. This was a Cistercian monastery founded by Robert of Ewias in the reign
of Henry I. We are now in the heart of the Golden Valley, which seems to be excavated out of
a plateau with long, terrace-like hills bounding it on either hand, their lower parts rich
in verdure, while their summits are dark and generally bare. Every available part of the lower
surface is thoroughly cultivated, its hedgerows and copses giving variety to the scene. As
we move up the valley the Scyrrid Vawr raises its notched and pointed summit like a peak dropped
down upon the lowlands. This mountain, nearly fifteen hundred feet high, whose name means the
"Great Fissure," is severed into an upper and lower summit by a deep cleft due to a landslip.
It is also known as the Holy Mountain, and in its day has been the goal of many pilgrims. St.
Michael, the guardian of the hills, has a chapel there, where crowds resorted on the eve of
his festival. It used to be the custom for the Welsh farmers to send for sackloads of earth
out of the cleft in this Holy Mountain, which they sprinkled over their houses and farm-buildings
to avoid evil. They were also especially careful to strew portions over the coffins and graves
of the dead. At the village of Wormridge, where some members of the Clive family are buried,
there is a grand old elm on the village-green around which the people used to assemble for
wrestling and for the performance of other rural amusements. At the base of this tree stood
the stocks, that dungeon "all of wood" to which it is said there was

  "----neither iron bar nor gate,
  Portcullis, chain, nor bolt, nor grate,
  And yet men durance there abide
  In dungeon scarce three inches wide."

This famous valley also contains the pretty church and scanty ruins of the castle of Kilpeck;
also the church of St. Peter at Rowlstone, where the ornamental representations of cocks and
apostolic figures all have their heads downward, in memory of the position in which St. Peter
was crucified. Here also, on the edge of the Black Mountains, is Oldcastle, whose ruins recall
its owner, Sir John "of that ilk," the martyr who was sentenced in 1417 to be taken from the
Tower of London to St. Giles' gallows, there to be hanged, and burned while hanging, as "a
most pernicious, detestable heretic." At Longtown, the residence of the Lacies, there are remains
of the walls and circular keep of their strong Border fortress. Kentchurch, on the slope of
Garway Hill, is a seat of the Earl of Scudamore, where anciently lived John of Kent, a poet
and mathematician, of whom Symonds tells us in his Records of the Rocks that "he sold his soul
to the devil, and constructed the bridge over the Monnow in a single night." The ruined castle
of Grosmont is about a mile distant: it was often besieged by the Welsh, and we are told that
on one occasion "the king came with a great army to raise the siege, whereof, as soon as the
Welshmen had understanding, they saved their lives by their legges." It was here that Henry
of Monmouth defeated the Welsh, capturing Glendower's son Griffith.

ABERGAVENNY AND LLANTHONY.

Rounding the southern extremity of the Black Mountains, and proceeding farther westward, we
enter another beautiful region, the Vale of Usk, a stream that flows southward into the estuary
of the Severn. Here is Abergavenny, with its ancient castle guarding the entrance to the upper
valley, and with mountains on every side. Here rises, just north of the town, the Sugar Loaf,
one thousand eight hundred and fifty-two feet high, and on the left hand the mass of old red
sandstone known as the Blorenge, one thousand seven hundred and twenty feet high. A few miles
up the tributary vale of Ewias, which discloses glorious scenery, are the ruins of Llanthony
Priory. The valley is a deep winding glen cut out by the Hodeni between the great cliffs of
the Black Mountains on the one side and the ranges around the Sugar Loaf on the other. In places
the cliffs are precipitous, but, generally, the lower slopes furnish pasture-land and occasional
woods, while the upper parts are covered with bracken fern, with a few trees and copses. The
priory stands on a gentle slope at the base of the Black Mountains, elevated a short distance
above the stream. Its original name was Llanhodeni, or "the Place by the Hodeni." It was founded
by two hermits in the beginning of the twelfth century--William de Lacy, a Norman knight, and
Ernisius, chaplain to Maud, wife of Henry I. They first built a small chapel dedicated to St.
David; gifts flowed in, and they were soon enabled to construct a grand religious house, occupied
by Augustinian monks, of whom Ernisius became the first prior. Predatory raids by the Welsh,
however, harassed the monks, and after submitting for some time to these annoyances they migrated
to Gloucester, and founded another priory alongside the Severn. Later, however, they returned
to the old place and kept up both establishments, but in the reign of Edward IV. the older
was merged into the newer "because of the turbulence of the neighboring people and the irregular
lives of its inmates." The ruins of Llanthony are supposed to date from about 1200, and are
of a marked though simple beauty. The convent buildings are almost all gone, excepting fragments
of the cellars and chapter-house. The prior's residence has become a farm-house, and where
the monks sat in solemn conclave is now its outbuildings. The towers are used, one for chambers
and the other for a dairy. The main part of the church is, however, carefully preserved with
a green turf floor, and the western towers up to the level of the walls of the nave are still
quite perfect, though the west window is gone and parts of the adjacent walls have perished.
The north transept has fallen, but the southern transept is still in fair condition, lighted
at the end by a pair of round-headed windows, with a circular one above; a semicircular arch
on its eastern side opens into a chapel. The choir is also well preserved. These ruins exhibit
semicircular with pointed arches in indiscriminate combination, and during the present century
decay has caused much of them to fall. It was to Llanthony that Walter Savage Landor removed
in 1809, selling much of his family estates in order to buy it. He projected grand improvements,
including the restoration of the priory, the construction of roads and bridges, and the cultivation
of extensive tracts on the mountainside, so that it became of note among literary men as the
home of one of the most original of their guild. His biographer tells us that he imported sheep
from Segovia, and applied to Southey and other friends to furnish him tenants who would introduce
improved agricultural methods. The inhabitants of this remote region were morose and impoverished,
and he wished to reclaim them. To clothe the bare spots on the flanks of the mountains, he
bought two thousand cones of the cedars of Lebanon, each calculated to produce a hundred seeds,
and he often exulted "in the thought of the million cedar trees which he would thus leave for
shelter and the delight of posterity." But he met the fate of many projectors. After four years'
struggle he became disgusted with Llanthony and its people: he was in a quarrel with almost
everybody, and his genius for punctiliousness had turned nearly the whole neighborhood against
him. He had sunk his capital in the estate and its improvements, and becoming embarrassed,
it was taken out of his hands and vested in trustees. His half-built house was pulled down,
and the disgusted Landor left England for the Continent. At Llanthony he composed Latin verses
and English tragedy, but his best literary labor was performed after he left there. A few miles
farther up the valley is Capel-y-Ffyn, where Father Ignatius within a few years has erected
his Anglican monastery. He was Rev. Mr. Lyne, and came from Norwich, where he was in frequent
collision with the bishop. After much pother and notoriety he took his Protestant monastic
settlement to this nook in the heart of the Black Mountains, where he and his monks perform
their orisons in peace.

NEWPORT, CARDIFF, AND LLANDAFF.

We now follow down the Usk, and at its mouth upon the Severn estuary is Newport, in Monmouthshire,
where there are large docks and a considerable trade. The ruins of Newport Castle stand on
the western bank of the river. In the suburbs is Caerleon, where the Romans long had the garrison-post
of the second Augustan legion. The museum here is filled with Roman remains, and the amphitheatre,
called "King Arthur's Round Table," is alongside. Proceeding westward about twelve miles along
the shore of the Severn estuary, we come to Penarth Roads in Glamorganshire, sheltered under
a bold headland at the mouths of the Ely and the Taff, and the flourishing Welsh seaport of
Cardiff on the banks of the latter stream. This is the outport of the Welsh coal and iron region,
and the Marquis of Bute, who is a large landowner here, has done much to develop its enormous
trade, which goes to all parts of the world. Its name is derived from Caer Taff, the fortress
on the river Taff, and in early times the Welsh established a castle there, but the present
one was of later construction, having been built by Robert Fitzhamon, the Anglo-Norman conqueror
of Glamorgan. It was afterwards strongly fortified, and here the unfortunate Robert, son of
William the Conqueror, was imprisoned for twenty-eight years by his brother Henry I., his eyes
being put out for his greater security. The tower where he was confined still stands alongside
the entrance gateway, and during his long captivity we are told that he soothed his weariness
by becoming a poet. The ancient keep remains standing on its circular mound, but the castle
has been restored and modernized by the Marquis of Bute, who occasionally resides there, and
has given it a fine western front flanked by a massive octagonal tower. The moat is filled
up, and, with the acclivities of the ramparts, is made a public walk and garden. In the valley
of the Taff, a short distance from Cardiff, is the famous "Rocking Stone," standing on the
western brink of a hill called Coed-pen-maen, or the "Wood of the Stone Summit." It was anciently
a Druids' altar, and with a surface of about one hundred square feet is only two to three feet
thick, so that it contains about two hundred and fifty cubic feet of stone. It is the rough
argillaceous sandstone that accompanies the coal-measures in this part of Wales, and a moderate
force gives it quite a rocking motion, which can be easily continued with one hand. It stands
nearly in equilibrium upon a pivotal rock beneath. Two miles from Cardiff is the ancient and
straggling village of Llandaff, which was the seat of the earliest Christian bishopric in Wales,
having been founded in the fourth century. Its cathedral, for a long time dilapidated, has
within a few years been thoroughly restored. All the valleys in the hilly region tributary
to Cardiff are full of coal and iron, the mining and smelting of which have made enormous fortunes
for their owners and developed a vast industry there within the present century. About nine
miles north of Cardiff is Caerphilly Castle, which has the most remarkable leaning tower in
Britain, it being more inclined from the perpendicular than any other that is known. It is
about eighty feet high, and leans over a distance of eleven feet. It rests only on a part of
its southern side, and maintains its position chiefly through the strength of the cement. This
castle was built by the De Clares in the reign of Henry III., and large additions were made
to it by Hugh Despenser, who garrisoned it for Edward II. in order to check the Welsh. It is
a large concentric castle, covering about thirty acres, having three distinct wards, seven
gate-houses, and thirty portcullises. It was here that Edward II. and his favorites, the Despensers,
were besieged by the queen in 1326. The defence was well conducted, and the besiegers were
greatly annoyed by melted metal thrown down on them from the walls, which was heated in furnaces
still remaining at the foot of the tower. They made a desperate assault, which was partially
successful, though it ultimately failed; and we are told that while in the castle they let
the red-hot metal run out of the furnaces, and, throwing water on it from the moat, caused
an explosion which tore the tower from its foundations and left it in its present condition.
The fissures made by the explosion are still visible, and it has stood thus for over five centuries.
The castle ultimately surrendered, the king having previously escaped. The Despensers were
beheaded, and their castle never regained its ancient splendor.

SWANSEA.

Journeying westward from Cardiff along the coast of Glamorganshire, upon the Bristol Channel,
we come to the Welsh Bay of Naples, where the chimneys replace the volcano of Vesuvius as smoke-producers.
This is the Bay of Swansea, a very fine one, extending for several miles in a grand curve from
Porthcawl headland on the eastern verge around to the Mumbles, where a bold limestone cliff
runs far out into the sea and forms a natural breakwater. Within this magnificent bay, with
its wooded and villa-lined shores, there is a spot that discloses the bare brown hills guarding
the entrance to the valley of the river Tawe, up which the houses of Swansea climb, with a
dense cloud of smoke overhanging them that is evolved from the smelting-furnaces and collieries
behind the town. Forests of masts appear where the smoke permits them to be visible, and then
to the right hand another gap and overhanging smoke-cloud marks the valley of the Neath. The
ancient Britons called the place Aber-tawe, from the river, and there are various derivations
of the present name. Some say it came from flocks of swans appearing in the bay, and others
from the porpoises or sea-swine, so that the reader may take his choice of Swan-sea or Swine-sea.
In the twelfth century it was known as Sweynsey, and perhaps the best authority says the name
came from Sweyne, a Scandinavian who frequented that coast with his ships. When the Normans
invaded Glamorgan, Henry Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, captured Swansea, and in the twelfth century
built a castle there. King John gave it a charter, and it became a town of some importance,
as he granted it extensive trading-privileges. In another charter, given by the lord of the
manor in 1305, the first allusion is made to Welsh coal, for the people among other privileges
are allowed to dig "pit-coal in Ballywasta." Thus began the industry that has become the mainstay
of prosperity in South Wales. Warwick's Castle at Swansea has entirely disappeared, the present
ruins being those of a castle afterwards built by Henry de Gower, who became Bishop of St.
David's. What is left of it is almost hidden by modern buildings. It has the remains of a curtain-wall
and two towers, the larger of which has an arcade beneath the battlement--an unusual but pleasing
feature. Lewellyn harassed the town and castle, but it had not much history until the Civil
War, when there was a little fighting for its possession. A Parliamentary ship appeared in
the bay and demanded the surrender of the town, which was refused; but in the following year
the Parliamentary troops captured it. Subsequently the castle changed hands several times--the
guide-book states "rather politically than gloriously." Cromwell ultimately took possession
in 1648, resided at Swansea for some time as lord of the manor, and was very liberal to the
town. The castle was dismantled and partly destroyed, the keep being used as a jail. Swansea,
like all the cities in the Welsh coal and metal region, has grown greatly during the present
century. Walter Savage Landor lived here for a while, just when the copper-works were beginning
to appear in the valley of the Tawe. Their smoke defiled the landscape, and he exclaimed, "Would
to God there was no trade upon earth!" He preferred Swansea Bay above the gulf of Salerno or
of Naples, and wrote, "Give me Swansea for scenery and climate! If ever it should be my fortune
to return to England, I would pass the remainder of my days in the neighborhood of Swansea,
between that place and the Mumbles."

Swansea's earliest dock was made by walling a tidal inlet called Port Tennant, and is still
used. Its former great dock was the North Dock, constructed in the old bed of the Tawe, a newer
and more direct channel being made for the river. It has two recently-constructed and larger
docks. Up the valley of the Tawe the town spreads several miles, and here are the enormous
copper-works and smelting-furnaces which make a reproduction of the infernal regions, defile
the air, but fill the purses of the townsfolk. Swansea is the greatest copper-smelting dépôt
in the world, drawing its ores from all parts of the globe. There had been copper-works on
the Neath three centuries ago, but the first upon the Tawe were established in 1745. From them
have grown the fame and wealth of the Cornish family of the Vivians, who have been copper-smelters
for three generations at Swansea, and in front of the town-hall stands the statue of the "Copper
King," the late John Henry Vivian, who represented Swansea in Parliament. There are also iron,
zinc, lead, and tin-plate works, making this a great metallurgical centre, while within forty
miles there are over five hundred collieries, some existing at the very doors of the smelting-works.
It is cheap fuel that has made the fortune of Swansea.

The bold promontory of the Mumbles, which bounds Swansea Bay to the westward, has become a
popular watering-place, into which it has gradually developed from the fishing-village nestling
under Oystermouth Castle. The bay was once a great producer of oysters, and dredging for them
was the chief industry of the inhabitants. The remains of the castle stand upon a knoll overlooking
the sea, and with higher hills behind. The Duke of Beaufort, to whom it belongs, keeps the
ruins carefully protected, and they are in rather good preservation. The plan is polygonal,
approaching a triangle, with its apex towards the sea, where was the only entrance, a gateway
guarded by two round towers, of which only the inner face now remains. The interior court is
small, with the keep at the north-eastern angle, having a chapel at the top. There are some
other apartments with vaulted chambers underground. Henry de Bellamont is believed to have
built this fortress at about the time of the construction of Swansea Castle, but it has not
contributed much to history, though now a picturesque ruin.

On the eastern side of Swansea Bay enters the Vale of Neath, where is also a manufacturing
town of rapid growth, while within the Vale is beautiful scenery. Neath is of great antiquity,
having been the Nidum of the days of Antoninus. At the Crumlyn Bog, where white lilies blossom
on the site of an ancient lake, legend says is entombed a primitive city, in proof whereof
strains of unearthly music may be occasionally heard issuing from beneath the waters. In the
valley on the western bank of the river are the extensive ruins of Neath Abbey, said once to
have been the fairest in all Wales. This religious house was founded by Richard de Granville
in the twelfth century, but its present buildings are of later date. Within its walls Edward
II. took refuge when he escaped from Caerphilly, for it had the privilege of sanctuary; but
after leaving Neath a faithless monk betrayed him, and he was put to death most cruelly at
Berkeley Castle. Only a ruined gateway remains of Neath Castle, blackened by the smoke of smelting-works.

CAERMARTHEN AND PEMBROKE.

Proceeding westward along the coast of the jutting peninsula formed by South Wales, another
grand bay indents the shore, and on the bold banks of the Towy is Caermarthen, which gives
the bay its name. Here there was a Roman station, on the site of which the castle was built,
but by whom is not accurately known. The Parliamentarians captured and dismantled it, and it
has since fallen into almost complete decay, though part was occupied as a jail till the last
century. In Caermarthen Church, Richard Steele the essayist is buried, while from the parade
is a beautiful view up the Vale of Towy towards Merlin's Hill and Abergwili, which was the
home of that renowned sage. Around the sweeping shores of Caermarthen Bay, about fifteen miles
to the westward, is Tenby Castle, the town, now a watering-place, being singularly situated
on the eastern and southern sides of a narrow rocky peninsula entirely surrounded by the sea,
excepting to the northward. This was the Welsh "Precipice of Fishes," and its castle was strongly
fortified. It stood a five days' siege from Cromwell, and its shattered ruins, with the keep
on the summit of the hill, show a strong fortress. From the top there is a magnificent view
of the neighboring shores and far across the sea to the lofty coasts of Devonshire. Manorbeer
Castle, belonging to Lord Milford, is near Tenby, and is considered the best structure of its
class in Wales. It is the carefully-preserved home of an old Norman baron, with its church,
mill, dove-house, pond, park, and grove, and "the houses of his vassals at such distance as
to be within call." The buildings have stone roofs, most of which are perfect, and it has been
tenantless, yet carefully preserved, since the Middle Ages. Parts of it have stood for six
centuries. In the upper portion of the Vale of Towy is the Golden Grove, a seat of the Earl
of Cawdor, a modern Elizabethan structure. Here lived Jeremy Taylor, having taken refuge there
in the Civil War, and he here wrote some of his greatest works.

Beyond Caermarthenshire is Pembrokeshire, forming the western extremity of the Welsh peninsula.
The river Cleddan, flowing south-westward, broadens at its mouth into the estuary known as
Milford Haven. It receives a western branch, on the side of which is the county-town, Haverfordwest,
placed on a hill where the De Clares founded a castle, of which little now remains but the
keep, used (as so many of them now are) as the county-jail. Cromwell demolished this castle
after it fell into his hands. The great promontory of St. David's Head juts out into the sea
sixteen miles to the westward. The Cleddan flows down between the towns of Pembroke and Milford.
The ruins of Pembroke Castle upon a high rock disclose an enormous circular keep, seventy-five
feet high and one hundred and sixty-three feet in circumference. It was begun in the eleventh
century, and was the birthplace of Henry VII. in 1456. Here Cromwell was repulsed in 1648,
but the fortress was secured for the Parliament after six weeks' siege. The garrison were reduced
to great straits, but were only subdued by the skilful use of artillery in battering down the
stairway leading to the well where they got their water: the spring that supplied them is still
there. Pembroke has extensive trade, and its shipbuilding dockyard covers eighty acres. Opposite
this dockyard is Milford, the harbor being a mile and a half wide. The railway from London
runs down to the pier, and passengers are transferred to steamers for Ireland, this being the
terminus of the Great Western Railway route, two hundred and eighty-five miles from the metropolis.
Milford Haven, at which we close this descriptive journey, stretches for ten miles inland from
the sea, varying from one to two miles in breadth, affords ample anchorage, and is strongly
fortified. The ancient Pictou Castle guards the junction of the two branches of the Cleddan
above Milford, while Carew Castle stands on a creek entering Milford Haven on the south-eastern
shore, and is an august though ruined relic of the baronial splendors of the Middle Ages. It
well represents the condition of most of the seacoast castles in this part of Wales, of one
of which Dyer has written.

  "His sides are clothed with waving wood,
  And ancient towers crown his brow.
  That cast an awful look below;
  Whose rugged sides the ivy creeps,
  And with her arms from falling keeps.
  'Tis now the raven's bleak abode;
  'Tis now th' apartment of the toad;
  And there the fox securely feeds.
  And there the poisonous adder breeds,
  Concealed in ruins, moss, and weeds;
  While ever and anon there fall
  Huge heaps of hoary, mouldered wall.

ASCOT AND BEARWOOD.

Leaving London by the South-western Railway, and skirting along the edge of Windsor Park, we
pass Virginia Water, the largest artificial lake in England. Upon its bosom float miniature
frigates, and its banks are bordered by a Chinese fishing temple, and a colonnade which was
brought from the African coast near Tunis. Here also are a hermitage overlooking the lake,
and the triangular turreted building known as the Belvedere, where a battery of guns is kept
that was used in the wars of the last century. Not far beyond is Sunninghill, near which was
Pope's early home, and in the garden of the vicarage are three trees planted by Burke, Chesterfield,
and Bolingbroke. Farther westward is the famous Ascot race-course on Ascot Heath, where the
races are run in June upon a circular course of about two miles, the neighborhood containing
many handsome villas. Still journeying westward, the route passes Wokingham, where Gay, Swift,
Pope, and Arbuthnot were on one occasion detained at the Rose Inn in wet weather, and whiled
away the time by composing the song of "Molly Mog."

Just beyond Wokingham is the fine estate of Bearwood, the seat of John Walter, Esq., the proprietor
of the London Times, one of the stately rural homes of England. Here, in a large and beautiful
park which retains much of its original forest character, and standing upon the terraced bank
of a lovely lake, Bearwood House has within a few years been entirely rebuilt, its feature
being the central picture-gallery containing a fine collection of paintings, around which clusters
a suite of grand apartments. The estate includes several thousand acres, and in the many pleasant
cottages scattered over it and the homes at Bearwood village many of the aged and infirm employés
of the Times pass their declining years. The Times, which was founded January 1, 1788, by the
grandfather of the present proprietor, has steadily grown in commanding influence until it
occupies the front rank in English journalism and is the leading newspaper of the kingdom.
Its proprietor has recently entirely rebuilt its publication-offices in Printing-House Square
and on Queen Victoria Street in London, adapting all the modern appliances of improved machinery
and methods to its publication. It is at Bearwood, however, that his philanthropic ideas also
find a broad field of usefulness in caring for those who have grown gray in the service of
the Times, and thither every year go the entire corps of employés to enjoy an annual picnic
under the spreading foliage of the park, while no home in England is more frequented by Americans
or extends to kin from across sea a more generous hospitality.

KING ALFRED'S WHITE HORSE.

In the chalk hills of Berkshire, beyond Reading and north of Hungerford, there rises an eminence
over nine hundred feet high, known as the White Horse Hill. It is a famous place; upon the
summit, covering a dozen acres, and from which eleven counties can be seen, there is a magnificent
Roman camp, with gates, ditch, and mound as complete as when the legions left it. To the westward
of the hill, and under its shadow, was the battlefield of Ashdown, where Alfred defeated the
Danes and broke their power in 871. He fought eight other battles against the Danes that year,
but they were mere skirmishes compared with the decisive victory of Ashdown, and in memory
of it he ordered his army to carve the White Horse on the hillside as the emblem of the standard
of Hengist. It is cut out of the turf, and can be seen to a great distance, being three hundred
and seventy-four feet long. After a spell of bad weather it gets out of condition, and can
only be restored to proper form by being scoured, this ceremony bringing a large concourse
of people from all the neighboring villages. The festival was held in 1857, and the old White
Horse was then brought back into proper form with much pomp and great rejoicing. The ancient
balladist thus quaintly describes the festivity on these memorable occasions:

  "The owld White Harse wants zettin to rights, and the squire hev promised
     good cheer,
  Zo we'll gee un a scrape to kip un in zhape, and a'll last for many a
     year.
  A was made a lang, lang time ago, wi a good dale o' labor and pains.
  By King Alferd the Great, when he spwiled their consate and caddled[B]
     thay wosbirds[C] the Danes.
  The Bleawin Stwun in days gone by wur King Alferd's bugle harn,
  And the tharnin tree you med plainly zee as is called King Alferd's
     tharn.
  There'll be backsword play, and climmin the powl, and a race for a peg,
     and a cheese.
  And us thenks as hisn's a dummell[D] zowl as dwont care for zich spwoorts
     as theze."

Leaving London by the Great Western Railway, and passing beyond Berkshire, we cross the boundary
into Wiltshire, and go through the longest railway-tunnel in England, the noted Box Tunnel,
which is a mile and three-quarters in length and cost over $2,500,000 to construct. It goes
through a ridge of great-oolite, from which the valuable bath-stone is quarried, and the railway
ultimately brings us to the cathedral city that boasts the tallest church-spire in England--Salisbury,
the county-town of Wiltshire, standing in the valley formed by the confluence of three rivers,
the Avon, Bourne, and Wiley.

[Footnote B: caddled, worried.]

SALISBURY.

The celebrated cathedral, which in some respects may be considered the earliest in England,
is the chief object at Salisbury, and was founded by Bishop Poore in 1220. It was the first
great church built in the Early English style, and its spire is among the most imposing Gothic
constructions in existence. The city of Salisbury is unique in having nothing Roman, Saxon,
or Norman in its origin, and in being even without the remains of a baronial fortress. It is
a purely English city, and, though it was surrounded by walls, they were merely boundaries
of the dominions of the ecclesiastics. The see of Salisbury in 1215 was removed from Old Sarum
to its present location in consequence of the frequent contests between the clergy and the
castellans, and soon afterwards the construction of the cathedral began. King Henry III. granted
the church a weekly market and an annual fair lasting eight days, and the symmetrical arrangement
of the streets is said to have been caused by the original laying out of the city in spaces
"seven perches each in length and three in breadth," as the historian tells us. The cathedral
close, which is surrounded by a wall, has four gateways, and the best view of the cathedral
is from the north-eastern side of the close, but a more distant view--say from a mile away--brings
out the proportions of the universally admired spire to much greater advantage. The chief cathedral
entrance is by the north porch, which is a fine and lofty structure, lined with a double arcade
and having an upper chamber. The nave is beautiful, though it suffers somewhat in warmth of
coloring from lacking stained glass, and the cloisters, which are entered from the south-western
transept, are admirable, being of later date and exhibiting a more developed style than the
remainder of the cathedral. Their graceful windows and long gray arcades contrast splendidly
with the greensward of the cloister-garth. They include an octagonal chapter-house, fifty-eight
feet in diameter and fifty-two feet high, which has been restored in memory of a recent bishop
at a cost of $260,000. The restoration has enriched the house with magnificent sculptures representing
Old-Testament history, and the restoration of the cathedral is also progressing. The adjoining
episcopal palace is an irregular but picturesque pile of buildings, with a gateway tower that
is a prominent feature.

Salisbury has plenty of old houses, like most English towns, and it also has a large square
market-place, containing the Gothic Poultry Cross, a most graceful stone structure, and also
the council-house of modern erection, in front of which is a statue of Sidney Herbert. Its
ancient banquet-hall, built four hundred years ago by John Halle, and having a lofty timber
roof and an elaborately-carved oak screen, is now used as the show-room for a shop.

To the northward of Salisbury is that region filled with prehistoric relics known as Salisbury
Plain. Here are ancient fortresses, barrows, and sepulchral mounds, earthworks, dykes, and
trenches, roadways of the Roman and the Briton, and the great British stronghold, guarding
the southern entrance to the plain, which became the Old Sarum of later times. Until within
a century this plain was a solitary and almost abandoned region, but now there are good roads
crossing it and much of the land is cultivated. It is a great triangular chalk-measure, each
side roughly estimated at twenty miles long. The Bourne, Wiley, and Avon flow through it to
meet near Salisbury, and all the bolder heights between their valleys are marked by ancient
fortifications. Wiltshire is thus said to be divided between chalk and cheese, for the northern
district beyond the plain is a great dairy region. Let us journey northward from Salisbury
across the plain, and as we enter its southern border there rises up almost at the edge the
conical hill of Old Sarum, crowned by intrenchments. When they were made is not known, but
in 552 they were a British defence against the Saxons, who captured them after a bitter fight
and overran the plain. Five centuries later William the Norman reviewed his army here, and
after the first Domesday survey summoned all the landholders of England to the number of sixty
thousand, who here swore fealty to him. The Normans strengthened it with a castle, and soon
a cathedral also rose at Old Sarum, while a town grew around them. But all have disappeared,
though now there can be traced the outlines of streets and houses and the foundations of the
old cathedral. When the clergy removed to Salisbury it is said they determined the new site
by an arrow shot from the ramparts of Old Sarum, and moving the cathedral soon attracted the
people. Old Sarum for some time remained a strong fortress with many houses, but the cathedral
was taken down in 1331 and its materials used for building the famous spire at Salisbury. The
castle decayed, the town was gradually deserted, and as long ago as the sixteenth century we
are told there was not a single house left there. And such it is to this day. Climbing the
steep face of the hill, the summit is found fenced by a vast earthen rampart and ditch enclosing
twenty-seven acres with an irregular circle, the height from the bottom of the ditch to the
top of the rampart being over one hundred feet. A smaller inner rampart as high as the outer
one made the central citadel. Nearly all the stone has long ago been carried off to build Salisbury,
and weeds and brushwood have overrun the remarkable fortress that has come down to us from
such venerable antiquity. Under the English "rotten-borough" system Old Sarum enjoyed the privilege
of sending two members to Parliament for three centuries after it ceased to be inhabited. The
old tree under which the election was held still exists, and the elder Pitt, who lived near
by, was first sent to Parliament as a representative of Old Sarum's vacant mounds.

STONEHENGE.

A few miles' farther journey to the northward over the hills and valleys, and among the sheep
that also wander on Salisbury Plain, brings us to that remarkable relic of earlier ages which
is probably the greatest curiosity in England--Stonehenge. When the gigantic stones were put
there, and what for, no man knows.

Stonehenge is about nine miles north of Salisbury, near the town of Amesbury, where another
ancient camp, known as "The Ramparts," crowns a wooded hill, around which the Avon flows, the
camp enclosing nearly forty acres. Stonehenge stands in a bleak, bare situation on Salisbury
Plain, and in its original perfection, as nearly as can now be judged, consisted of two concentric
circles and two ellipses of upright stones, surrounded by a bank and ditch, outside of which
is a single upright stone and traces of a hippodrome. The entrance to the cluster of circles
was from the north-east, and the avenue to it is still traceable by the banks of earth. The
outer circle at Stonehenge originally consisted of thirty upright stones fixed in the ground
at intervals of about three and a half feet. On the top of them thirty other stones formed
a continuous ring about sixteen feet above the ground. Within this circle, and leaving a space
about nine feet wide between, was another circle of thirty or forty unhewn stones about four
to seven feet high. Within this, again, was the grandest part of the structure--a great ellipse
formed of five triplets of stones or trilithons, each composed of two uprights and one placed
crosswise. Within these was the inner ellipse of nineteen obelisks surrounding the altar-stone.
Such was Stonehenge originally, but its ruins now appear very differently, and are only a confused
pile of huge stones, for the most part such as are found on the neighboring plain and known
as sarsens (a siliceous sandstone), though some of the smaller ones may be boulders brought
from a distance. The diameter of the enclosure is three hundred and thirty-six feet. On the
outer circle sixteen of the uprights and six of the surmounting stones forming the ring remain
in their original positions. Two of the inner trilithons, the highest rising twenty-five feet,
remain perfect, and there are two single uprights, which lean considerably. The flat slab or
altar-stone is lying on the ground. The avenue of approach opens in front of the inner ellipse
and in a line with the altar-stone. In the avenue, outside the enclosure, is a block sixteen
feet high in a leaning position, and known as the Friar's Heel. The legend tells us that when
the great Enemy of the human race was raising Stonehenge he muttered to himself that no one
would ever know how it was done. A passing friar, hearing him, exclaimed, "That's more than
thee can tell," and then fled. The Enemy flung this great stone after him, but hit only the
friar's heel. The investigators of Stonehenge say that when standing on the altar-stone the
midsummer sun is seen to rise to the north-east directly over the "Friar's Heel." The traces
of the avenue in which it stands are, however, soon found to divide into two smaller avenues,
one running south-east and the other north, and the latter is connected beyond with a long
enclosure called the Cursus, and marked by banks of earth stretching east and west for about
a mile and a half: there is nothing known of its use. The whole country about Stonehenge is
dotted with groups of sepulchral barrows, and at the western end of the Cursus is a cluster
of them more prominent than the others, and known as the "Seven Burrows." Stonehenge itself
inspires with mystery and awe, the blocks being gray with lichens and worn by centuries of
storms. Reference to them is found in the earliest chronicles of Britain, and countless legends
are told of their origin and history, they usually being traced to mythical hands. In James
I.'s reign Stonehenge was said to be a Roman temple, dedicated to Coelus; subsequently, it
was attributed to the Danes, the Phoenicians, the Britons, and the Druids by various writers.
Sir Richard Hoare, who has studied the mystery most closely, declines all these theories, and
says the monument is grand but "voiceless." Horace Walpole shrewdly observes that whoever examines
Stonehenge attributes it to that class of antiquity of which he is himself most fond; and thus
it remains an insoluble problem to puzzle the investigator and impress the tourist. Michael
Drayton plaintively and quaintly confesses that no one has yet solved the mystery:

  "Dull heape, that thus thy head above the rest doest reare,
  Precisely yet not know'st who first did place thee there.
  Ill did those mightie men to trust thee with their storie;
  Thou hast forgot their names who rear'd thee for their glorie;
  For all their wondrous cost, thou that hast serv'd them so,
  What 'tis to trust to tombes by thee we easily know."

WILTON HOUSE.

Returning along the valley of the Avon past the almost lifeless town of Amesbury, where there
formerly was a grand Benedictine monastery long since gone to decay, we cross over to the Wiley
Vale, and at about three miles distance from Salisbury come to the Earl of Pembroke's seat
at Wilton House. The ancient town of Wilton--or, as it was originally called, Willytown--stands
at the confluence of the rivers Nadder and Wiley. The Britons established it, and it was one
of the capitals of the West Saxons. It was famous long before the Norman Conquest, and it afterwards
obtained renown from the number and importance of its monastic establishments, having had no
less than twelve parish churches, though not a trace of its abbey now remains. Henry VIII.
dissolved it, and gave the site and buildings to Sir William Herbert, who was afterwards created
Earl of Pembroke, and from its relics Wilton House was largely constructed. The town is now
chiefly noted as the manufactory of Axminster and Wilton carpets, dextrously woven by operatives
who use most primitive machinery. The Earl's Park adjoins the town, and in it is Wilton House,
one of the grandest palaces in England, standing upon the site of the abbey. The buildings
were designed by Holbein, and the garden front being burned in 1648, was rebuilt soon afterwards,
while the entire structure was enlarged and remodelled during the present century, the cloisters
being then added for the display of the fine collection of sculptures. The plan of the house
is a quadrangle, with a glazed cloister occupying the central square. Within this cloister
and the hall leading to it are the well-known Pembroke Marbles--statues, busts, urns, vases,
bassi-relievi, and fragments of great value from Grecian and Roman works. This collection was
formed during the last century, being gathered by the then earl from various sources. In the
hall are statues, but its chief interest comes from the numerous suits of armor with which
it is adorned, chiefly memorials of the battle of St. Quentin, fought in 1557, when the Earl
of Pembroke commanded the British forces. One of the suits was worn by the earl himself, and
two others by the Constable of France and the Duc de Montpensier, both being taken prisoner.
On either side are entrances to various apartments containing valuable paintings. The chief
of these is the "Family Picture," regarded as Vandyke's masterpiece--seventeen feet long and
eleven feet high, and filling one end of the drawing-room. It contains ten full-length figures--Philip,
Earl of Pembroke, and his countess and their children. Above them, hovering in the clouds,
are three other children, who died in early life. In the Double Cube-room, which is regarded
as a gem in its way and has a most magnificent fireplace, there are some thirteen other paintings
by Vandyke. Other paintings by Italian masters are also distributed on the walls of the various
apartments, but the Vandykes are regarded as the gems of the collection. The library is a large
and lofty apartment, with an oak-panelled ceiling, and a fine collection of volumes with appropriate
furnishing. Out of the library window the western view over the terrace discloses charming
pleasure-grounds, laid out in the Italian style from designs by a former Countess of Pembroke,
while in the background is a beautiful porch constructed by Holbein. To the gardens, summer-houses
and conservatories add their attractions, while beyond is the valley of the Nadder, over which
a picturesque bridge leads to the park. This bridge has an Ionic colonnade, and in the park
are some of the finest cedars to be seen in the kingdom. Here, it is said, Sir Philip Sidney
wrote Arcadia, and the work shows that he drew much inspiration from these gardens and grounds,
for it abounds in lifelike descriptions of Nature.

At Wilton also lived George Herbert the poet, and later Sidney Herbert, who was afterwards
made Lord Herbert of Lea, and whose son is now the thirteenth Earl of Pembroke. A statue of
Sidney Herbert has already been referred to as standing in Pall Mall, London, and another is
in Salisbury. He was secretary of war, yet was the gentle and genial advocate of peace and
charity to all mankind, and his premature death was regarded as a public calamity. He erected
in 1844 the graceful New Church at Wilton. It was the Earls of Pembroke in the last century
who were chiefly instrumental in bringing the manufacturers of fine carpets over from France
and Flanders and laying the foundation of that trade, in which England now far surpasses those
countries. The factory at Axminster, on the southern coast, was also afterwards transferred
to Wilton. These carpets are all hand-made, and the higher class, which are an inch or more
in thickness and of the softness of down when trod upon, are also of the most gorgeous design
and brilliancy of colors.

BATH.

Crossing over the hills to the north-west of Salisbury Plain, we descend to the attractive
valley of another river Avon, and come to the "Queen of all the Spas in the World," the city
of Bath. It is the chief town of Somersetshire, and is surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills.
The abbey and principal streets are in the valley, while above, on its northern slope, rise
terraces and crescents, tier upon tier, to a height of nearly eight hundred feet, the most
conspicuous being the Royal and the Lansdowne Crescents. Many of the buildings are handsome,
and are constructed of the white great-oolite, known as bath-stone. To its waters this famous
resort owes its importance, but from an insignificant place Bath has risen to the highest point
of popularity as a fashionable watering-place and in architectural magnificence through the
genius of Architect Wood and Master-of-Ceremonies Beau Nash. The legendary king Bladud is said
to have first discovered the Bath waters twenty-seven hundred years ago, and to have built
a town there and dedicated the medicinal springs to Minerva, so that "Bladud's Well" has passed
into a proverb of sparkling inexhaustibility. The Romans, passionately attached to the luxury
of the hot springs, made Bath one of their chief stations, and here and in the neighborhood
the foundations of their extensive buildings have been traced, with the remains of altars,
baths, tessellated pavements, and ornaments, and few British towns can produce such a collection
of Roman relics. In the height of the Roman power in the fifth century the city extended nearly
three miles along the valley, and was surrounded by a wall twenty feet high and nine feet thick.
Such a fascinating spot was naturally selected for the foundation of a religious house at an
early period, and we consequently find that the abbey of Bath was built by King Offa in the
eighth century, and refounded by King Edgar in the tenth century. It existed until the dissolution
in 1539. The church fell into decay in the reign of Henry VII., and the present abbey-church
was then built, being for a long time unfinished. It has recently been restored. It stands
at the southern extremity of High Street, and is a fine specimen of Perpendicular Gothic, the
plan being a cross, with a tower at the intersection rising one hundred and sixty-two feet
and flanked by octagonal turrets. The church is two hundred and ten feet long, and has a fan-traced,
stone-vaulted roof seventy-eight feet high, while the western front contains a magnificent
window flanked by turrets carved with angels, who are ascending and descending, but have, unfortunately,
all lost their heads. The Pump Room, which is one of the chief buildings, is a classical structure
with a Corinthian portico bearing the motto, "Water, best of elements!" A band plays in the
spacious saloon, which also contains a statue of the genius of Bath, Beau Nash, whose monument
is in the abbey-church. Here the waters, which are the hottest in England, reaching a temperature
of 120°, tumble continually from a drinking-fountain into a serpentine basin beneath. There
are numerous other baths replete with comforts for the invalid, for this is essentially a hospital
town, and the city also contains many stately public and private buildings, and its Victoria
Park and Sydney Gardens are beautiful and popular resorts. The wild scenery of the neighborhood
provides myriads of attractive drives and walks, while on top of Lansdowne Hill, where Beckford
is buried, is his tower, one hundred and fifty feet high and commanding extensive views. The
Bath waters, which are alkaline-sulphurous with a slight proportion of iron, are considered
beneficial for palsy, rheumatism, gout, and scrofulous and cutaneous affections. The chief
spring discharges one hundred and twenty-eight gallons a minute. While a hundred years ago
Bath was at the height of its celebrity, the German spas have since diverted part of the stream
of visitors.

FONTHILL AND BECKFORD.

It was at Bath that Pitt and Sheridan lived, but its most eccentric resident was William Beckford,
the author of Vathek, who came to Bath from Fonthill, not far from Salisbury. His father, a
London alderman, owned Fonthill, and died in 1770, leaving his son William, aged ten, with
$5,000,000 ready money and $500,000 annual income. He wrote Vathek in early life after extensive
travels, but founded its scenes and characters upon places and people at Fonthill. He then
began building Fonthill Abbey, shrouding his proceedings in the greatest mystery and surrounding
his estate with a wall twelve feet high and seven miles long, guarded by chevaux-de-frise to
keep out intruders. The building of the abbey was to him a romance pursued with wild enthusiasm.
So anxious was he to get it finished that he employed relays of men, working day and night
and throughout Sunday, keeping them liberally supplied with liquor. The first tower was built
of wood, four hundred feet high, to see its effect, and it was then taken down and the same
form put up in wood covered with cement. This fell down, and the third tower was built of masonry.
When the idea of the abbey occurred to Beckford he was extending a small summer-house, but
he was in such a hurry that he would not remove the summer-house to make a proper foundation
for the tower, but carried it up on the walls already standing, the work being done in wretched
style and chiefly by semi-drunken men. He employed five hundred men day and night at the work,
and once the torches used set fire to the tower at the top, a sight that he greatly enjoyed.
Beckford lived at the abbey, practically a hermit, for nearly twenty years, but his fortunes
being impaired he removed to Bath in 1822. Preparatory to selling Fonthill, he opened the long-sealed
place to public exhibition at a guinea a ticket, and sold seventy-two hundred tickets. Then
for thirty-seven days he conducted an auction-sale of the treasures at Fonthill, charging a
half-guinea admission. He ultimately sold the estate for $1,750,000. In 1825 the tower, which
had been insecurely built, fell with a great crash, and so frightened the new owner, who was
an invalid, that, though unhurt by the disaster, he died soon afterwards. The estate was again
sold and the abbey taken down, so that now only the foundations can be traced.

BRISTOL.

Proceeding about twelve miles down the beautiful valley of the Avon, we come to its junction
with the Frome, where is located the ancient city and port of Bristol, the capital of the west
of England. A magnificent suspension-bridge spans the gorge of the Avon, connecting Bristol
with its suburb of Clifton, and it is believed that the earliest settlements by the Romans
were on the heights of Clifton and the adjoining Brandon Hill. The Saxons called it Bright-stow,
or the "Illustrious City;" from this the name changed to Bristow, as it was known in the twelfth
century, and Bristold in the reign of Henry III. When the original owners concluded that it
was time to come down from the hills, they founded the city in the valley at the junction of
the two rivers. A market-cross was erected where the main streets joined, and Bristow Castle
was built at the eastern extremity, where the Avon makes a right-angled bend. The town was
surrounded with walls, and in the thirteenth century the course of the Frome was diverted in
order to make a longer quay and get more room for buildings. Few traces remain of the old castle,
but portions of the ancient walls can still be seen. In the fifteenth century the city-walls
were described as lofty and massive and protected by twenty-five embattled towers, some round
and some square. The abbey of St. Augustine was also then flourishing, having been founded
in the twelfth century. Bristol was in the Middle Ages the second port of England, enjoying
lucrative trade with all parts of the world, and in the fifteenth century a Bristol ship carrying
nine hundred tons was looked upon with awe as a leviathan of the ocean. Sebastian Cabot, the
great explorer, was a native of Bristol, and his expeditions were fitted out there, and it
was Bristol that in 1838 built and sent out the first English steamer that crossed the Atlantic,
the Great Western. It still enjoys a lucrative trade, and has recently opened new docks at
the mouth of the Avon, seven miles below the city, so that this venerable port may be considered
as renewing its prosperous career. It has over two hundred thousand population, and in past
times had the honor of being represented in Parliament by Edmund Burke. The pomp of christenings
and funerals then far exceeded anything seen in any other part of England, and the hospitality
of the city was widely renowned. This was especially the case with the banquets given by the
guild of sugar-refiners, where the drink was a rich beverage made of Spanish wine and known
as "Bristol milk." In 1831 the opposition of the Recorder of Bristol to the Reform Bill resulted
in serious riots, causing a great fire that burned the Mansion House and a large number of
other prominent buildings. The troops suppressed the riots after shooting several rioters,
and four were afterwards hanged and twenty-six transported. The city has since enjoyed a tranquil
history.

Bristol Cathedral was the convent-church of St. Augustine's Abbey, and was begun in the twelfth
century. It formerly consisted only of the choir and transepts, the nave having been destroyed
in the fifteenth century, but the nave was rebuilt in uniform style with the remainder of the
church in 1876. The cathedral presents a mixture of architectural styles, and in it are the
tombs of the Earls of Berkeley, who were its benefactors for generations. Among them was Maurice,
Lord Berkeley, who died in 1368 from wounds received at Poictiers. The abbot, John Newland,
or Nail-heart, was also a benefactor of the abbey, and is said to have erected the magnificent
Norman doorway to the west of it leading to the college green. The most attractive portion
of the interior of the cathedral is the north aisle of the choir, known as the Berkeley Chapel,
a beautiful specimen of Early English style. The side-aisles of the choir are of the same height
as the central aisle, and in the transepts are monuments to Bishop Butler, author of the Analogy,
and to Robert Southey, who was a native of Bristol. This cathedral is not yet complete, the
external ornamentation of the nave and the upper portions of the western towers being unfinished.
Forty-seven bishops have sat upon the episcopal throne of Bristol. The old market-cross, which
stood for four centuries in Bristol, was removed in the last century, but in 1860 it was replaced
by a modern one erected upon the college green. The church of St. Mary Redcliffe, standing
upon a red sandstone rock on the south side of the Avon, is the finest church in Bristol, and
Chatterton calls it the "Pride of Bristowe and Western Londe." It is an Early Perpendicular
structure, two hundred and thirty-one feet long, with a steeple rising over two hundred feet,
founded in the twelfth century, but enlarged and rebuilt in the fifteenth century by William
Canynge, who was then described as "the richest merchant of Bristow, and chosen five times
mayor of the said town." He and his wife Joan have their monuments in the church, and upon
his tomb is inscribed the list of his ships. He entered holy orders in his declining years,
and founded a college at Westbury, whither he retired. It has for many years been the custom
for the mayor and corporation of Bristol to attend this church on Whitsunday in state, when
the pavement is strewn with rushes and the building decorated with flowers. In the western
entrance is suspended a bone of a large whale, which, according to tradition, is the rib of
the dun cow that anciently supplied Bristol with her milk. Sebastian Cabot, in all probability,
presented the city with this bone after his discovery of Newfoundland. The chief popular interest
in St. Mary Redcliffe, however, is its connection with Thomas Chatterton, born in a neighboring
street in 1752, the son of a humble schoolmaster, who ultimately went up to London to write
for the booksellers, and there committed suicide at the early age of seventeen. A monument
to this precocious genius, who claimed to have recovered ancient manuscripts from the church-archives,
stands in the churchyard. Bristol is full of old and quaint churches and narrow yet picturesque
streets, with lofty gabled timber-houses.

The great gorge of the Avon, five hundred feet deep, is, however, its most attractive possession.
The suspension-bridge, erected by the munificence of a citizen, spans this gorge at the height
of two hundred and eighty-seven feet, and cost nearly $500,000. It is twelve hundred and twenty
feet long, and has a single span of seven hundred and three feet crossing the ravine between
St. Vincent's Rocks and the Leigh Woods. Alongside this gorge rises Brandon Hill, which Queen
Elizabeth sold to two citizens of Bristol, who in turn sold it to the city, with a proviso
that the corporation should there "admit the drying of clothes by the townswomen, as had been
accustomed;" and to this day its western slope is still used as a clothes-drying ground. From
this the tradition arose--which, however, Bristol denounces as a libel--"that the queen gave
the use of this hill to poor freemen's daughters as a dowry, because she took compassion on
the many plain faces which she saw in one of her visits." Some hot springs issue out of St.
Vincent's Rocks, and these give Clifton fame as a watering-place. A fine pump-house has been
built there, and the waters are said to be useful in pulmonary complaints. From this beginning
large and ornamental suburbs have been terraced on the rocks and hills above the springs, while
on the summit is an observatory. There is a hermitage cave of great antiquity carved in the
perpendicular face of the rock just above the river, and known as the "Giant's Hole." The entire
neighborhood is full of charming scenery, and thus the ancient port presents varied attractions,
combining business profit with recreation, while from the hilltops there are glorious views
extending far down Bristol Channel to the dim hills of South Wales.

WELLS.

Proceeding southward into Somersetshire, we arrive at the cathedral city of Wells, which is
united with Bath in the well-known bishopric of Bath and Wells, and is considered the most
completely representative ecclesiastical city in England. It gets its name from its numerous
springs, taking their rise from the wells in the Bishop's Garden, where they form a lake of
great beauty, while bright, clear water runs through various streets of the town. After leaving
the edge of the Bristol Channel the plain of the Somersetshire lowlands is bordered by rocky
uplands, of which the most important is the elevated plateau known as the Mendip Hills, carved
on the outside with winding valleys having precipitous sides. Wells nestles in a wide grassy
basin at the foot of the Mendips, its entire history being ecclesiastical, and that not very
eventful. It never had a castle, and no defensive works beyond the wall and moat enclosing
the bishop's palace. It seems to have had its origin from the Romans, who worked lead-mines
among the Mendips, but the first fact actually known about it is that the Saxon king Ina established
here a house of secular canons "near a spring dedicated to St. Andrew." It grew in importance
and privileges until it became a bishopric, there having been fifteen bishops prior to the
Norman Conquest. The double title of Bishop of Bath and Wells was first assumed in the days
of King Stephen. In looking at the town from a distance two buildings rise conspicuously--the
belfry of St. Cuthbert's Church and the group of triple towers crowning the cathedral. There
are few aggregations of ecclesiastical buildings in England that surpass those of Wells, with
the attractive gateways and antique houses of the close, the grand façade of the cathedral,
and the episcopal palace with its ruined banquet-hall and surrounding moat. From the ancient
market-square of the city, stone gateways surmounted by gray towers give access, one to the
close and the other to the enclosure of the palace. Entering the close, the western front of
the cathedral is seen, the most beautiful façade of its kind in Britain--an exquisite piece
of Early English architecture, with Perpendicular towers and unrivalled sculptures rising tier
upon tier, with architectural accompaniments such as are only to be found at Chartres or Rheims.
The old Saxon cathedral lasted until Bishop Jocelyn's time in the thirteenth century, when
he began a systematic rebuilding, which was not finished until the days of Bishop Beckington
in the fifteenth century, who completed the gateways and cloisters. Entering the cathedral,
the strange spectacle is at once seen of singular inverted arches under the central tower,
forming a cross of St. Andrew, to whom the building is dedicated. These arches were inserted
subsequently to the erection of the tower to strengthen its supports--an ingenious contrivance
not without a certain beauty. The choir is peculiar and beautiful, and produces a wonderful
effect, due to its groups of arches, the Lady Chapel and retro-choir, and the rich splendors
of the stained glass. The chapter-house, north-east of the northern transept, is built over
a crypt, and is octagonal in plan, the roof supported by a central column, while the crypt
beneath has an additional ring of columns. The cloisters are south of the cathedral, having
three walks, with galleries above the eastern and western walks, the former being the library.
Through the eastern wall of the cloisters a door leads to a private garden, in which and in
the Bishop's Garden adjoining are the wells that name the city. The most important of these
is St. Andrew's Well, whence a spring issues into a large pool. The water from the wells falls
by two cascades into the surrounding moat, and a conduit also takes away some of it to supply
the town. From the edge of the pool is the most striking view of the cathedral.

The close is surrounded by various ancient houses, and the embattled wall with its bastioned
towers and moat encloses about fifteen acres. Here is the gateway known as the "Bishop's Eye,"
and another called the "Dean's Eye," the deanery where Henry VII. was entertained in 1497,
the archdeanery, coming down from the thirteenth century, and the beautiful Chain Gate in the
north-east corner that connects the cathedral with the Vicar's Close. The latter, one of the
most peculiar features of Wells, is a long and narrow court entered through an archway, and
having ancient houses with modernized fittings on either hand. Bishop Ralph of Shrewsbury erected
this close in the fourteenth century, and his monumental inscription in the cathedral tells
us he was a great sportsman, who "destroyed by hunting all the wild beasts of the great forest
of Cheddar." The moat and wall completely surround the bishop's palace, and its northern front
overhangs the moat, where an oriel window is pointed out as the room where Bishop Kidder and
his wife were killed by the falling of a stack of chimneys upon their bed, blown down by the
terrible gale of 1703 that swept away the Eddystone Lighthouse. It was Bishop Ralph who made
the walls and moat as a defence against the monks of Bath, who had threatened to kill him;
Bishop Jocelyn built the palace. Adjoining it is the great banquet-hall, of which only the
northern and western walls remain, in ruins. It was a magnificent hall, destroyed from mere
greed. After the alienation of the monasteries it fell into the hands of Sir John Gates, who
tore it partly down to sell the materials; but happily, as the antiquarian relates, Gates was
beheaded in 1553 for complicity in Lady Jane Grey's attempt to reach the throne, and the desecration
was stopped. Afterwards, Parliament sold Wells for a nominal price to Dr. Burgess, and he renewed
the spoliation, but, fortunately again, the Restoration came; he had to give up his spoils,
and died in jail. Thus was the remnant of the ruin saved. It was in this hall that Whiting,
the last abbot of Glastonbury, was condemned, and hanged on Tor Hill above his own abbey. The
great bishops of Wells were the episcopal Nimrod Ralph, and Beckington, who left his mark so
strongly on the cathedral and town. He was a weaver's son, born at the village of Beckington,
near the town of Frome, and from it got his name. Hadrian de Castello, who had a romantic history,
became Bishop of Wells in 1504. Pope Alexander VI. made him a cardinal, and afterwards tried
to poison him with some others at a banquet; by mistake the pope himself drank of the poisoned
wine, and died. The bishop afterwards entered into a conspiracy against Leo X., but, being
detected, escaped from Rome in disguise and disappeared. Wolsey was Bishop of Wells at one
time, but the most illustrious prelate who held the see after the Reformation was Thomas Ken.
He was educated at Winchester, and afterwards became a prebend of the cathedral there. Charles
II. paid a visit to Winchester, and, bringing Nell Gwynne with him, Ken was asked to allow
her to occupy his house. He flatly refused, which had just the opposite effect upon the king
to that which would be supposed, for he actually respected Ken for it, and when the see of
Wells became vacant he offered it to "the little fellow who would not give poor Nelly a lodging."
Ken attended the king's deathbed shortly afterwards. He was very popular in the diocese, and
after the Sedgemoor battle he succored the fugitives, and with the Bishop of Ely gave spiritual
consolation to the unfortunate Duke of Monmouth on the scaffold. Ken was one of the six bishops
committed by James II. to the Tower, but, strangely enough, he declined to take the oaths of
allegiance to William III., and, being deprived of preferment, retired to the home of his nephew,
Izaak Walton. All reverence his sanctity and courage, and admire his morning and evening hymns,
written in a summer-house in the Bishop's Garden.

The Mendip Hills, with their picturesque gorges and winding valleys, were formerly a royal
forest. It was here that King Edmund was hunting the red deer when his horse took fright and
galloped towards the brow of the highest part of the Cheddar Cliffs. Shortly before, the king
had quarrelled with Dunstan, and expelled the holy man from his court. As the horse galloped
with him to destruction, he vowed if preserved to make amends. The horse halted on the brink
as if checked by an unseen hand, and the king immediately sought Dunstan and made him abbot
of Glastonbury. These hills were the haunt of the fiercest wild beasts in England, and their
caves still furnish relics of lions to a larger extent than any other part of the kingdom.
The most remarkable deposit of these bones is in the Wookey Hole, on the southern edge of the
Mendips, about two miles from Wells. At the head of a short and picturesque glen, beneath an
ivy-festooned cliff, is a cavern whence the river Axe issues and flows down the glen. The cave
that disclosed the animal bones is on the left bank of the glen, and was but recently discovered
in making a mill-race. It also contained about three hundred old Roman coins, rude flint implements,
and skeletons of a mammoth and woolly rhinoceros. The larger cave, which is hung with fine
stalactites, can be explored for some distance. Near the entrance is a mass of rock known as
the Witch of Wookey, who was turned into stone there by a timely prayer from a monk who opportunely
arrived from Glastonbury. The underground course of the Axe in and beyond this cave is traced
for at least two miles. The Mendips contain other pretty glens and gorges, and from the summit
of their cliffs can be seen the valley of the Axe winding away southward, while to the westward
the scene broadens into the level plains that border the Bristol Channel, guarded on either
side by the hills of Exmoor and of Wales. Little villages cluster around the bases of the hills,
the most noted being Cheddar, famous for its cheese, straggling about the entrance to a gorge
in which caves are numerous, each closed by a door, where an admission-fee is charged. Some
of them are lighted with gas and entered upon paved paths. Lead-and zinc-mines are worked in
the glens, and above Cheddar rises the Black Down to a height of eleven hundred feet, the most
elevated summit of the Mendips.

GLASTONBURY.

About six miles south-west of Wells is the ancient Isle of Avelon, where St. Patrick is said
to have spent the closing years of his life, and where are the ruins of one of the earliest
and most extensive religious houses in England--Glastonbury Abbey. A sixpence is charged to
visit the ruins, which adjoin the chief street, but the remnants of the vast church, that was
nearly six hundred feet long, are scanty. Of the attendant buildings there only remain the
abbot's kitchen and an adjoining gateway, now converted into an inn. This kitchen is about
thirty-four feet square within the walls and seventy-two feet high. The church ruins include
some of the walls and tower-foundations, with a well-preserved and exceedingly rich chapel
dedicated to St. Joseph. On the High Street is the old George Inn, which was the hostelrie
for the pilgrims, built in the reign of Edward IV. and still used. It is fronted by a splendid
mass of panelling, and the central gateway has a bay-window alongside rising the entire height
of the house. The church of St. John the Baptist in Glastonbury has a fine tower, elevated
one hundred and forty feet and richly adorned with canopied niches, being crowned by an open-work
parapet and slender pinnacles. Almost the entire town of Glastonbury is either constructed
from spoils of the abbey or else is made up of parts of its buildings. One of the most characteristic
of the preserved buildings is the Tribunal, now a suite of lawyers' offices. Its deeply-recessed
lower windows and the oriel above have a venerable appearance, while beyond rises the tower
of St. John the Baptist. Behind the town is the "Weary-all Hill," from which arose the foundation
of the monastery. Tradition tells that Joseph of Arimathea, toiling up the steep ascent, drove
his thorn staff into the ground and said to his followers that they would rest there. The thorn
budded, and still flowers, it is said, in winter. This was regarded as an omen, and they constructed
the abbey there around the chapel of St. Joseph. The ponderous abbot's kitchen, we are told,
was built by the last abbot, who boasted, when Henry VIII. threatened to burn the monastery,
that he would have a kitchen that all the wood in Mendip Forest could not burn down. King Arthur
was buried at Glastonbury, and a veracious historian in the twelfth century wrote that he was
present at the disinterment of the remains of the king and his wife. "The shin-bone of the
king," he says, "when placed side by side with that of a tall man, reached three fingers above
his knee, and his skull was fearfully wounded." The remains of King Arthur's wife, which were
quite perfect, fell into dust upon exposure to the air.

SEDGEMOOR BATTLEFIELD.

Proceeding westward towards the Bristol Channel, the low and marshy plain of Sedgemoor is reached.
Much of it is reclaimed from the sea, and here and there the surface is broken by isolated
knolls, there being some two hundred square miles of this region, with the range of Polden
Hills extending through it and rising in some places three hundred feet high. In earlier times
this was an exact reproduction of the Cambridgeshire fenland, and then, we are told,

  "The flood of the Severn Sea flowed over half the plain,
  And a hundred capes, with huts and trees, above the flood remain;
  'Tis water here and water there, and the lordly Parrett's way
  Hath never a trace on its pathless face, as in the former day."

It is changed now, being thoroughly drained, but in the days of the
Saxons the river Parrett was the frontier of Wessex, and one of its
districts sheltered Alfred from the first onset of the Danish invasion
when he retreated to the fastnesses of the Isle of Athelney. In the
epoch of the Normans and in the Civil War there was fighting all along
the Parrett. After the defeat at Naseby the Royalists, under Lord
Goring, on July 10, 1645, met their foes on the bank of the Parrett,
near Langport, were defeated and put to flight, losing fourteen thousand
prisoners, and the king's troops never made a stand afterwards.
Bridgwater is a quiet town of about twelve thousand people on the
Parrett, a half dozen miles from the sea, and in its churchyard reposes
Oldmixon, who was made collector of customs here as a reward for his
abusive writings, in the course of which he virulently attacked Pope.
  And why ye gods should two and two make four?'
  He said, and climbed a stranded lighter's height.
  Shot to the black abyss, and plunged downright."

In the Market Inn at Bridgwater Admiral Blake was born, who never held a naval command until
past the age of fifty, and then triumphed over the Dutch and the Spaniards, disputing Van Tromp's
right to hoist a broom at his masthead, and burned the Spanish fleet in the harbor of Santa
Cruz. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, but Charles II. ejected his bones. Bridgwater is
now chiefly noted for its bath bricks, made of a mixture of clay and sand deposited near there
by the tidal currents.

It was from the Bridgwater church tower that the unfortunate son of Charles II. and Lucy Walters,
who had been proclaimed "King Monmouth," looked out upon the grassy plains towards the eastward
before venturing the last contest for the kingdom. This view is over Sedgemoor, the scene of
the last fight deserving the name of a battle that has been fought on British ground. It is
a long tract of morass lying between the foot of the Polden Hills and the Parrett River, but
with a fringe of somewhat higher ground along the latter, where are Weston Zoyland, Chedzoy,
and Middlezoy, each a hamlet clustering around its old church, that at Weston Zoyland being
surmounted by an attractive square tower over one hundred feet high. Monmouth had been proclaimed
king by the mayor and corporation of Bridgwater June 21, 1685, but had been checked at Bath,
and fell back again to Bridgwater, where his army was encamped on the Castle Field. He had
been three weeks in the kingdom without marked success, and the royal army was closing in upon
him. Four thousand troops under Lord Feversham marched westward, and on the Sunday evening
of July 5th, when Monmouth looked out from the tower, had encamped upon Sedgemoor about three
miles from Bridgwater. Monmouth had seven thousand men to oppose them, but his forces were
mostly undisciplined and badly armed, some having only scythes fastened on poles. The moor
was then partly reclaimed and intersected by trenches, and Feversham's headquarters was at
Weston Zoyland, where the royal cavalry were encamped, with the other troops at Middlezoy and
Chedzoy beyond. Monmouth saw that their divisions were somewhat separated, and that his only
hope was a night-attack. At midnight he started, marching his army by a circuitous route to
the royal camp, strict silence being observed and not a drum beaten or a shot fired. Three
ditches had to be crossed to reach the camp, two of which Monmouth knew of, but he was unfortunately
ignorant of the third, called the Bussex Rhine, behind which the camp had been made. A fog
came down over the moor; the first ditch was crossed successfully, but the guide missing his
way caused some confusion before the second was reached, during which a pistol was discharged
that aroused a sentinel, who rode off and gave the alarm. As the royal drums beat to arms Monmouth
rapidly advanced, when he suddenly found himself checked by the Bussex Rhine, behind which
the royal army was forming in line of battle in the fog. "For whom are you?" demanded a royal
officer. Immediately the royal troops replied with a terrific volley of musketry that sent
the rebel cavalry flying in all directions. Monmouth, then coming up with the infantry, was
startled to find the broad ditch in front of him. His troops halted on the edge, and for three
quarters of an hour the opposing forces fired volleys at each other across the ditch. But the
end was not far off. John Churchill was a subordinate in the royal army and formed its line
of battle, thus indicating the future triumphs of the Duke of Marlborough. Then the royal cavalry
came up, and in a few minutes the rebels were routed, and Monmouth, seeing all was lost, rode
from the field. His foot-soldiers, with their scythes and butt-ends of muskets, made a gallant
stand, fighting like old soldiers, though their ammunition was all gone. To conquer them the
artillery were brought up, for which service the Bishop of Winchester loaned his coach-horses.
The cannon were ill served, but routed the rebels, and then the infantry poured over the ditch
and put them to flight. The king lost three hundred killed and wounded; the rebel loss was
at least a thousand slain, while there was little mercy for the survivors. The sun rose over
a field of carnage, with the king's cavalry hacking and hewing among their fleeing foes. Monmouth,
with one or two followers, was by this time far away among the hills, but was afterwards captured
in the New Forest, and ended his life on the scaffold. The Sedgemoor carnage went on all the
morning; the fugitives poured into Bridgwater with the pursuers at their heels; five hundred
prisoners were crowded into Weston Zoyland Church, and the next day a long row of gibbets appeared
on the road between the town and the church. Bridgwater suffered under a reign of terror from
Colonel Kirke and his "Lambs," who put a hundred prisoners to death during the week following
the battle, and treated the others with great cruelty. Then Judge Jeffreys came there to execute
judicial tortures, and by his harsh and terrible administration of the law, and his horrible
cruelties and injustice, gained the reputation that has ever since been execrated.

Six miles south-east of Bridgwater is the Isle of Athelney, a peninsula in the marsh between
the Parrett and the Tone. Here King Alfred sought refuge from the Danes until he could get
time to mature the plans that ultimately drove them from his kingdom. It was while here that
the incident of the burned cakes occurred. The king was disguised as a peasant, and, living
in a swineherd's cottage, performed various menial offices. The good wife left him in charge
of some cakes that were baking, with instructions to turn them at the proper time. His mind
wandered in thought and he forgot his trust. The good wife returned, found the cakes burning,
and the guest dreaming by the fireside; she lost her temper, and expressed a decided opinion
about the lazy lout who was ready enough to eat, but less ready to work. In the seventeenth
century there was found in the marshes here a jewel that Alfred had lost: it is of gold and
enamel, bearing words signifying, "Alfred had me wrought." The following spring (878) he sallied
forth, defeated the Danes in Wiltshire, and captured their king Guthram, who was afterwards
baptized near Athelney by the name of Æthelstan; they still show his baptismal font in Aller
Church, near by.

SHERBORNE.

Crossing over from Somersetshire into Dorsetshire, we arrive in the northern part of that county
at Sherborne, which was one of the earliest religious establishments in this part of England,
having been founded by King Ina in the eighth century. Here was the see that was removed to
Old Sarum in the eleventh century, and subsequently to Salisbury. After the removal, Sherborne
became an abbey, and its remains are to be seen in the parish church, which still exists, of
Norman architecture, and having a low central tower supported by massive piers. The porch is
almost all that survives of the original structure, the remainder having been burned in 1436,
but afterwards restored. Within this church are buried the Saxon kings, Æthelbald and Æthelbert,
the brothers of King Alfred. Such of the domestic buildings of the abbey as have been preserved
are now the well-known Sherborne Grammar-School. The great bell of the abbey was given it by
Cardinal Wolsey, and weighed sixty thousand pounds. It bears this motto:

  "By Wolsey's gift I measure time for all;
  To mirth, to grief, to church, I serve to call."

It was unfortunately cracked in 1858, but has been recast. The chief fame of Sherborne, however,
is as the home of Sir Walter Raleigh, of whom Napier says that his "fortunes were alike remarkable
for enviable success and pitiable reverses. Raised to eminent station through the favor of
the greatest female sovereign of England, he perished on the scaffold through the dislike and
cowardly policy of the meanest of her kings." Herein tradition says was the seed of Raleigh's
misfortunes. King Stephen dispossessed the lands, and gave them to the Montagues, who met with
grievous disasters, the estate ultimately reverting to the Church. In Edward VI.'s reign Sherborne
was conveyed to the Duke of Somerset, but he was beheaded. This fall was ominous, and no question
he was apt to consider it so." But Raleigh did not falter, notwithstanding the omen. He begged
and obtained the grant of the castle from Queen Elizabeth, and then married Elizabeth Throgmorton
and returned there, building himself a new house surrounded by ornamental gardens and orchards.
He settled the estate ultimately upon his son, but his enemies got King James to take it away
and give it to a young Scotch favorite, Robert Carr, afterwards Earl of Somerset. Lady Raleigh
upon her knees, with her children, appealed to James not to do this, but it was of no avail.
The king only answered, "I mun have the land; I mun have it for Carr." She was a woman of high
spirit, and while still on her knees she prayed God to punish those who had wrongfully exposed
her and her children to ruin. Carr met with constant misfortunes, being ultimately implicated
in a murder and imprisoned. James's son Charles, afterwards king, aided to bring Raleigh to
the block, while the widow had the satisfaction of living long enough to be assured that Charles
would meet the same fate. The remains of the castle are at the east end of Sherborne, covering
about four acres on a rocky eminence surrounded by a ditch. The gate-tower and portions of
the walls and buildings still exist. The house that Raleigh built is now called the "Castle,"
and has since had extensive wings added to it, with a fine lake between it and the old castle-ruins,
surrounded by attractive pleasure-grounds and a park. This famous estate fell into possession
of the Earl of Digby, and is now a home of G. D. Wingfield Digby, Esq., being a popular resort
in the hunting-season.

THE COAST OF DORSET.

The river Avon upon which Salisbury stands--for there are several of these Avon Rivers in England--flows
southward between Dorsetshire and Hampshire, and falls into the Channel. Westward from its
mouth extends a line of sandy cliffs, broken by occasional ravines or chines, past Bournemouth
to Poole Harbor, a broad estuary surrounded by low hills which is protected by a high ridge
of chalk rocks on its south-western side running out into the sea. The sleepy town of Poole
stands on the shore, having dim recollections of its ships and commerce of centuries ago. It
was a nursery for privateersmen, and many are the exploits recorded of them. It was also, from
the intricacy of its creeks and the roving character of its people, a notorious place for smuggling.
Poole is an old-fashioned, brick-built town, with a picturesque gateway yet remaining as a
specimen of its ancient defences. In the vale of the Stour, which here debouches, is the ancient
minster of Wimborne, founded in the reign of King Ina by his sister, and containing the grave
of the Saxon king Æthelred. It is not remarkable excepting for its age, and for having had
for its dean Reginald Pole before he became a cardinal. The ancient and shrunken town of Wareham
is also near by, having had quite a military history, but being almost destroyed by fire in
1762, from which it never recovered. It has now but three churches out of the eight it originally
possessed, and of these only one is in regular use. But the great memory of this part of the
coast is connected with Corfe Castle.

The so-called Isle of Purbeck is near Poole Harbor, and the ruined castle of Corfe stands in
a narrow gap in the hills, guarding the entrance to the southern part of this island, its name
being derived from ceorfan, meaning "to cut," so that it refers to the cut or gap in the hills.
Queen Ælfrida in the tenth century had a hunting-lodge here. According to the legend, her stepson,
King Edward, was hunting in the neighborhood and stopped at the door to ask for a drink. It
was brought, and as he raised the cup to his lips he was stabbed in the back--it is said by
the queen's own hand. He put spurs to his horse, galloped off, fell, and was dragged along
the road, the battered corpse being buried at Wareham. The queen had committed this murder
for the benefit of her youngest son, and hearing him bewail his brother's death, she flew into
a passion, and, no cudgel being at hand, belabored him so stoutly with a large wax candle that
he could never afterwards bear the sight of one. The king's remains were then translated to
Shaftesbury, miracles were wrought, and the queen, finding affairs becoming serious, founded
two nunneries in expiation of the murder, to one of which she retired. This began the fame
of the Isle of Purbeck, although the present Corfe Castle was not built till the twelfth century.
It was attacked by, but baffled, Stephen, and King John used it as a royal residence, prison,
and treasure-house. Here he starved to death twenty-two French knights who had been partisans
of his nephew Arthur; and he also hanged a hermit named Peter who had made rash prophecies
of his downfall, this being intended as a wholesome warning to other unwelcome prophets. Its
subsequent history was uneventful until the Civil War, when it was greatly enlarged and strengthened,
occupying the upper part of the hill overlooking the village. Now it is ruined in every part:
the entrance-gateway leans over and is insecure, the walls are rent, and the towers shattered,
while the keep is but a broken shell, with one side entirely gone. This destruction was done
in the Civil War, when Corfe was held for King Charles. In 1643, when the owner, Sir John Bankes,
was absent, the castle was attacked, and his lady hastily collected the tenantry and some provisions
and made the best defence she could. The besiegers melted down the roof of the village church
for bullets, and approached the castle-walls under cover of two pent-houses called, respectively,
"the Boar" and "the Sow." So galling a fire, however, was kept up by the defenders that they
were driven off, and their commander with difficulty rallied them for another attack, being
well fortified with "Dutch courage." This time the brave little garrison, even the women and
children taking part, hurled down upon them hot embers, paving-stones, and whatever else came
handiest, and again drove them off when the effect of the liquor was spent; then, the king's
forces coming to the rescue, they decamped. But the fortunes of Charles waned: he was defeated
at Naseby, Sir John Bankes died, and Corfe was the only stronghold left him between London
and Exeter. Again it was attacked, and, through treachery, captured. It was afterwards dismantled
and blown up by gunpowder, while its heroic defender, Lady Bankes, was deprived of her dowry
as penalty for her "malignity." She received it again, however, and had the satisfaction of
living until after the Restoration.

Beyond the range of chalk-cliffs that here cross Dorsetshire the coast runs several miles southward
from Poole Harbor, the promontory of the Foreland protruding into the sea and dividing the
shore into two bays. The northern one is Studland Bay, alongside which is the singular rock
of the Agglestone. The devil, we are told, was sitting one day upon one of the Needles off
the neighboring coast of the Isle of Wight, looking about him to see what the world was doing,
when he espied the towers of Corfe Castle just rising towards completion; he seized a huge
rock and hurled it at the castle, but it fell short, and remains to this day upon the moor.
Nestling under the slopes of this moor, in a ravine leading down to the shore, is Studland
village, with its little Norman church embosomed in foliage and surrounded by ancient gravestones
and memorial crosses. South of the Foreland, and protected by the chalk range from the northern
blasts, is Swanage Bay, bordered by its little town, which in past times has been variously
called Swanwich, Sandwich, and Swanage. It is a quiet watering-place at the east end of Purbeck
Isle, landlocked from every rough wind, a pleasant spot for summer sea-bathing, with huge elms
growing on its beach and garden-flowers basking in the sunshine. The Purbeck marble, which
was so extensively used for church-building a few centuries ago, and which may be seen in Westminster
Abbey, Canterbury, Salisbury, Ely, and other cathedrals, was quarried here, though other quarries
of it exist in Britain. It is an aggregate of freshwater shells, which polishes handsomely,
but is liable to crumble, and has in later years been generally superseded by other building-stone.
The coast southward is lined with quarries, and the lofty promontory of St. Aldhelm's Head
projects into the sea, a conspicuous headland seen from afar. It was named for the first Bishop
of Sherborne, and its summit rises nearly five hundred feet, being crowned by an ancient chapel,
where in former days a priest trimmed the beacon-light and prayed for the mariners' safety.
This cliff exhibits sections of Portland stone, and the view is unusually fine, the entire
coast displaying vast walls of cream-colored limestone. These rocks extend westward past Encombe,
where Chancellor Eldon closed his life, and the Vale of Kimmeridge, where they dig a dark blue
clay, and Worbarrow Bay, with its amphitheatre of crags composed of Portland stone and breached
here and there to form the gateways into interior coves. Here are the Barndoor Cove, entered
through a natural archway; the Man-of-War Cove, its guardian rock representing a vessel; and
Lulworth Cove, with its castle-ruins, most of which have been worked into the modern structure
near by where the exiled French king, Charles X., once lived.

WEYMOUTH AND PORTLAND.

The coast next sweeps around to the southward, forming the broad expanse of Weymouth Bay, with
the precipitous headland of the White Nore on the one hand, and the crags of Portland Isle
spreading on the other far out to sea, with the breakwater extending to the northward enclosing
the bay and making a harbor under the lee of which vast fleets can anchor in safety. Weymouth
is a popular watering-place and the point of departure for steamers for the Channel Islands,
and it was George III.'s favorite resort. He had a house there, and on the cliffs behind the
town an ingenious soldier, by cutting away the turf and exposing the white chalk beneath, has
made a gigantic figure of the king on horseback, of clever execution and said to be a good
likeness. Weymouth has a steamboat-pier and an attractive esplanade, and on the cliffs west
of the town and overlooking the sea are the ruins of Sandsfoot Castle, erected for coast-defence
by Henry VIII. They are of little interest, however, and south of them is the estuary of the
Fleet, which divides Portland Isle from the mainland, but these are linked together by the
Chesil Bank, a huge mound of pebbles forming a natural breakwater. At the lower end it is an
embankment forty feet high, composed of large pebbles, some reaching a foot in diameter. As
it stretches northward it decreases gradually in height and in the size of its pebbles, till
it becomes a low shingly beach. To this great natural embankment the value of Portland Harbor
is chiefly due, and many are the theories to account for its formation. Near the estuary of
the Fleet is Abbotsbury, where are the ruins of an ancient church and the Earl of Ilchester's
famous swannery, where he has twelve hundred swans.

The Isle of Portland, thus strangely linked to the mainland, is an elevated limestone plateau
guarded on all sides by steep cliffs and about nine miles in circumference. Not far from the
end of the Chesil Bank is Portland Castle, another coast-defence erected by Henry VIII. Near
by, on the western slope, is the village of Chesilton. The highest part of the isle is Verne
Hill, four hundred and ninety-five feet high, where there is a strong fort with casemated barracks
that can accommodate three thousand men. Other works also defend the island, which is regarded
of great strategic importance, and in the neighborhood are the famous quarries whence the Portland
stone has been excavated for two centuries. The most esteemed is the hard, pale, cream-colored
oolite, which was introduced to the notice of London by Inigo Jones, and has been popular ever
since. With it have been built St. Paul's Cathedral, Somerset House, the towers of Westminster
Abbey, and Whitehall, with other London buildings. Here also was quarried the stone for the
great breakwater, of which the late Prince Consort deposited the first stone in 1849, and the
Prince of Wales the last one in 1872, making the largest artificial harbor in the world. The
first portion of this breakwater runs east from the shore eighteen hundred feet. There is an
opening four hundred feet wide, and the outer breakwater thence extends north-east six thousand
feet, terminated by a strong circular fort guarding the harbor entrance. It cost over $5,000,000,
and about one thousand convicts were employed in its construction, which took nearly six million
tons of stone. The materials, quarried and laden on cars by the convicts, were sent down an
inclined plane and out to the appointed place, where they were emptied into the sea. The prison
of the convicts is on the east side of the island adjoining the quarries, and is almost a town
of itself, having twenty-five hundred inmates. The prison-garb is blue and white stripes in
summer, and a brownish-gray jacket and oilskin cap in winter. The convicts have built their
own chapels and schools, and on the Cove of Church Hope near by are the ruins of Bow and Arrow
Castle, constructed by William Rufus on a cliff overhanging the sea, and also a modern building
known as Pennsylvania Castle, built by William Penn's grandson in a sheltered nook. The views
here are of great beauty, while at the southern end of the promontory is the castellated mass
of rocks projecting far into the sea, and supporting two lighthouses, known as the Portland
Bill. Below is the dangerous surf called the Race of Portland, where the tide flows with unusual
swiftness, and in the bordering cliffs are many romantic caves where the restless waves make
a constant plashing.

THE CHANNEL ISLANDS.

From the harbor of Portland we will make a steamer-excursion almost across the English Channel,
going about one hundred and fifteen miles to the Channel Islands, off the north-western coast
of France and within a few miles of the shores of Normandy and Brittany. They are Jersey, Guernsey,
Alderney, and Sark, standing in a picturesque situation, with a mild climate and fertile soil,
and devoted mainly to dairying and to fishing. These islands were known to the Romans, and
their strategic position is so valuable that England, while getting but $100,000 revenue from
them, has expended two or three millions annually in maintaining their fortifications. It was
upon the dangerous cluster of rocks west of Alderney, and known as the Caskets, that Henry
I.'s only son, Prince William, perished in the twelfth century, and here the man-of-war Victory
was lost with eleven hundred men in 1744. Jersey is the most remarkable of these islands for
its castles and forts, and has seen many fierce attacks. Both Henry VII. and Charles II. when
in exile found refuge in Jersey. In approaching this island the fantastic outline of the Corbière
Promontory on the western side is striking. When first seen through the morning haze it resembles
a huge elephant supporting an embattled tower, but the apparition vanishes on closer approach.
A lighthouse crowns the rock, and the bay of St. Aubin spreads a grand crescent of smiling
shores, in the centre of which is Elizabeth Castle, standing on a lofty insulated rock whose
jagged pinnacles are reared in grotesque array around the battlements. Within the bay is a
safe harbor, with the villages of St. Helier and St. Aubin on the shores. Here is the hermitage
once occupied by Jersey's patron saint Elericus, and an abbey dedicated to him anciently occupied
the site of the castle. The impregnable works of the great Regent Fort are upon a precipitous
hill commanding the harbor and castle. Upon the eastern side of the island is another huge
fortress, called the castle of Mont Orgueil, upon a lofty conical rock forming the northern
headland of Grouville Bay. The apex of the mountain shoots up in the centre of the fortifications
as high as the flagstaff which is planted upon them. Here lived Charles II. when in exile,
and this is the most interesting part of Jersey, historically. A part of the fortifications
is said to date from Cæsar's incursion into Gaul, and the Romans in honor of their leader called
the island Cæsarea, describing it at that time as a stronghold of the Druids, of whose worship
many monuments remain. It was first attached to the British Crown at the Norman Conquest, and,
though the French in the many wars since then have sent frequent expeditions against the island,
they have never been able to hold it. The Channel Islands altogether cover about seventy-five
square miles. Alderney, which is within seven miles of the French coast, now has an extensive
harbor of refuge. Guernsey contains the remains of two Norman castles--one almost entirely
gone, and the other called Ivy Castle, from its ruins being mantled with shrubbery. Its great
defensive work, Fort George, built in the last century, stands in a commanding position and
is of enormous strength. Upon a rocky islet off St. Peter's Port is the chief defensive fort
of that harbor, located about a mile to seaward--Castle Cornet, a work of venerable antiquity,
parts of which were built by the Romans. In 1672, Viscount Christopher Hatton was governor
of Guernsey, and was blown up with his family in Castle Cornet, the powder-magazine being struck
by lightning at midnight. He was in bed, was blown out of the window, and lay for some time
on the ramparts unhurt. Most of the family and attendants perished, but his infant daughter
Anne was found next day alive, and sleeping in her cradle under a beam in the ruins, uninjured
by the explosion. She lived to marry the Earl of Winchelsea and have thirty children, of whom
thirteen survived her.

THE SOUTHERN COAST OF DEVON.

Westward of Portland Isle, on the southern coast near Abbotsbury, are the ruins of a monastery
built by Canute, and St. Catharine's Chapel, perched on a steep hill overlooking the sea, while
in the neighborhood is the Earl of Ilchester's castle, surrounded by attractive gardens. Beyond
this the little river Lym flows into the sea from among grand yet broken crags mantled with
woods, and in a deep valley at the foot of the hills is the romantic town of Lyme Regis, with
a pleasant beach and good bathing, the force of the waves being broken by a pier called the
Cobb, frequently washed away and as often restored, sometimes at great cost. This is a semicircular
breakwater eleven hundred and seventy-nine feet long, protecting the harbor. There are grand
cliffs around this little harbor, the Golden Cap and the Rhodehorn rearing their heads on high,
the summit of the latter being cut by a passage called the Devil's Bellows. It was near Lyme
Regis that on Christmas, 1839, the Dowlands landslip took place, an area of forty acres sliding
down the cliff to a lower level, roughly removing two cottages and an orchard in the descent.
Five miles farther west the pretty river Axe, which flows down from the Mendips, enters the
sea, and on an eminence overlooking the stream is the town of Axminster, formerly a Saxon stronghold,
and afterwards famous for the carpet manufacture, which some time ago was removed to Wilton.
Its minster was founded in the days of Æthelstan, but the remains are Norman work. Still farther
west the little river Sid flows down past Sidbury and Sidford, and enters the sea through a
valley in which nestles the charming watering-place of Sidmouth, celebrated for its pebbles
found among the green sand. Salcombe Hill and High Peak, towering five hundred feet, guard
the valley-entrance on either hand, and in the church of St. Nicholas is a memorial window
erected by Queen Victoria in memory of her father, the Duke of Kent, who died here in 1820.
The esplanade in front of the town is protected by a sea-wall seventeen hundred feet long.
Near here, at Hayes Barton, now an Elizabethan farm-house, Sir Walter Raleigh was born, the
room in which he first saw the light being still shown. Beyond this, to the westward, the river
Exe falls into the sea through a broad estuary at Exmouth, also a favorite watering-place,
over which the lofty Haldon Hills keep guard at a height of eight hundred feet, the Beacon
Walks being cut on their sloping face and tastefully planted with trees, while a broad esplanade
protected by a sea-wall fronts the town. The shores all along are dotted with villas, and this
coast is a popular resort, the villages gradually expanding into towns as their populations
increase.

EXETER.

About eleven miles up the river Exe, before it has broadened out into the estuary, but where
it flows through a well-marked valley and washes the bases of the cliffs, stands Exeter, a
city set upon a hill. Here was an ancient "dun," or British hill-fort, succeeded by a Roman,
and then by a Norman, castle, with the town descending upon the slope towards the river and
spreading into the suburb of St. Thomas on the other side. The growing city now covers several
neighboring hills and tributary valleys, one of the flourishing new suburbs being named Pennsylvania.
Upon the ridge, where was located the old hill-fort, there still remain in a grove of trees
some scanty ruins of the Norman castle, while well up the slope of the hill rise the bold and
massive towers of Exeter Cathedral. Unique among English municipalities, this is essentially
a hill-city, the ancient British name of Caerwise having been Latinized by the Romans into
Isca, and then changed to Exanceaster, which was afterwards shortened into the modern Exeter.
Nobody knows when it was founded: the Romans almost at the beginning of the Christian era found
a flourishing British city alongside the Exe, and it is claimed to have been "a walled city
before the incarnation of Christ." Isca makes its appearance in the Roman records without giving
the date of its capture, while it is also uncertain when the Saxons superseded the Romans and
developed its name into Exanceaster. They enclosed its hill of Rougemont, however, with a wall
of masonry, and encircled the city with ramparts built of square stones and strengthened by
towers. Here the Saxon king Æthelstan held a meeting of the Witan of the whole realm and proclaimed
his laws, and in the first year of the eleventh century the Danes sailed up to the town and
attacked it, being, however, beaten off after a desperate struggle. Two years later they made
another attack, captured and despoiled it; but it rose from its ruins, and the townsmen afterwards
defied the Norman as they had the Dane. William attacked and breached the walls, the city surrendered,
and then he built Rougemont Castle, whose venerable ruins remain, to curb the stout-hearted
city. It was repeatedly besieged--in the days of Stephen, Henry VII., and Henry VIII., the
last siege during the quarrels preceding the Reformation lasting thirty four days, the defenders
being reduced to eating horse-flesh. In the Civil War the Royalists captured it from the Parliamentarians,
who held it, and it remained in the king's possession until after the defeat at Naseby, when
Cromwell recaptured it. Charles II. was proclaimed at Exeter with special rejoicings. When
William, Prince of Orange, first landed in England, he came to the valley of the Teign, near
Newton Abbot, where the block of granite is still preserved from which his proclamation was
read to the people. Three days later he entered Exeter, escorted by a great crowd of the townspeople.
He went in military state to the cathedral and mounted the bishop's throne, with its lofty
spire-like canopy, rich with the carving of the fifteenth century, while the choir sang the
Te Deum, after which Bishop Burnet read his proclamation. He remained several days in Exeter,
while events ripened elsewhere for his reception. Here many Englishmen of rank and influence
joined him, and his quarters began to display the appearance of a court. The daily show of
rich liveries and of coaches drawn by six horses among the old houses in the cathedral close,
with their protruding bow-windows and balconies, gave the usually quiet place a palatial appearance,
the king's audience-chamber being in the deanery. He remained here two weeks, and then left
for London, the entire kingdom having risen in his favor and James having deserted the capital
for Salisbury. This ended Exeter's stirring history. It afterwards grew in fame as a manufactory
of woollens, but this has declined, and the chief industries now consist in the making of gloves
and agricultural implements.

Exeter Cathedral is the most conspicuous feature in the view upon approaching the city, rising
well above the surrounding houses, its two massive gray towers giving it something of the appearance
of a fortress. This feature makes it unique among English cathedrals, especially as the towers
form its transepts. The close is contracted, and around it are business edifices instead of
ecclesiastical buildings. The exterior is plain and simple in outline, excepting the western
front, which is a very rich example of fourteenth-century Gothic. A church is said to have
been standing on its site and dedicated to the Benedictines as early as the seventh century,
and it lasted until after the Norman Conquest. The Normans built a new church in the twelfth
century, which contained the present towers, but the remainder of the structure was afterwards
transformed as we now see it. The rich western façade consists of three stages, receding one
behind the other; the lower is the porch, subdivided into three enriched arcades containing
figures and pierced by three doorways. The second stage is formed above this by the ends of
the nave and side-aisles, being terminated with a battlement flanked by small pinnacles about
halfway up the nave gable. A fine window pierces this stage, and above it the remainder of
the gable forms the third stage, also pierced by a window which opens over the battlement.
The figures in the lower stage represent the kings of England, apostles, and saints. The interior
of the nave discloses stone vaulting and Decorated architecture, with large clerestory windows,
but a small triforium. The bosses of the roof, which presents an unbroken line, are seventy
feet above the floor. One of the bays on the north side of the triforium is a beautiful minstrels'
gallery, communicating with a chamber above the porch. The inner walls of the towers have been
cut away, completely adapting them for transepts, the towers being supported on great pointed
arches. In the large east window the stained glass commemorates St. Sidwell, a lady murdered
in the eighth century at a well near Exeter by a blow from a scythe at the instigation of her
stepmother, who coveted her property. The cathedral is rich in monumental relics, and it has
recently been thoroughly restored. Little remains of the ancient convent-buildings beyond the
chapter-house, which adjoins the south transept.

The older parts of Exeter present a quaint and picturesque appearance, especially along the
High Street, where is located the old Guild Hall, a ponderous stone building, with a curious
front projecting over the footway and supported by columns; it was built in the sixteenth century.
Sir Thomas Bodley, who founded the Bodleian Library of Oxford, was born in Exeter, and also
Richard Hooker the theologian. Among its famous bishops was Trelawney (then the Bishop of Bristol),
who was one of the seven bishops committed by King James to the Tower, and whose memory still
lives in the West-Country refrain, the singing of which had so much to do with raising the
English revolt in favor of the Prince of Orange:

    "And shall Trelawney die?
    And shall Trelawney die?
  There's twenty thousand Cornish lads
    Will know the reason why."

TEIGNMOUTH AND TORBAY.

From the estuary of the Exe the Devonshire coast trends almost southward towards the mouth
of the Dart, being everywhere bordered by picturesque cliffs. Nestling in a gap among the crags,
under the protecting shelter of the headlands, is the little watering-place of Dawlish, fronted
by villas and flower-gardens, and having to the southward strange pinnacles of red rock rising
from the edge of the sea, two of them forming a fanciful resemblance to the human figure, being
named the Parson and the Clerk. A storm recently knocked off a considerable part of the Parson's
head. Upon their sides, piercing through tunnel after tunnel, runs the railway almost over
the water's edge. Soon the cliffs are breached with a wider opening, and here flows out the
river Teign, where is the larger watering-place of Teignmouth, which has frequently suffered
from Danish and French invasions, but is now best known by having the longest wooden bridge
in England spanning the river-estuary and extending seventeen hundred feet, with a swing-draw
to permit vessels to pass. The valley is broad, with picturesque villas on either bank. Below
Teignmouth the shores project into the sea at the bold promontory of Hope's Nose, which has
Torbay on one side and Babbicombe Bay on the other. Here, around the shores of the bay on the
southern side of the projecting cape, is the renowned watering-place of Torquay, which has
grown enormously since it has become such a fashionable resort in recent years. Its beautiful
scenery and sheltered position have made it a favorite home for invalids. Its name is derived
from the neighboring hill of Mohun's Tor, where there are ruins of an abbey. To the north of
the headland is the fine sweep of Babbicombe Bay, with a border of smooth sand beach backed
by steep cliffs, above which is the plateau where most of its villas are built. To the south
of the headland Torquay spreads around a fine park, with highlands protecting it on almost
all sides, while farther to the southward the limestone cliffs are bold and lofty, one of them
presenting the singular feature of a natural arch called London Bridge, where the sea has pierced
the extremity of a headland. Upon the eastern face of the promontory of Hope's Nose, and just
below Babbicombe Bay, another pretty cove has been hollowed out by the action of the waves,
its sides being densely clothed with foliage, while a pebbly beach fringes the shore. This
is Anstis Cove, its northern border guarded by limestone cliffs that have been broken at their
outer verge into pointed reefs. Compton Castle, about two miles from Torbay, is a specimen,
though in ruins, of the ancient fortified mansion of the reign of Edward III. It is of massive
construction, built of the native limestone, and part of it is now used as a farm-house. Following
around the deeply-recessed curve of Torbay, its southern boundary is found to be the bold promontory
of Berry Head, and here on the northern side is the old fishing-port of Brixham, having Church
Brixham built up on the cliffs and Brixham Quay down on the beach. It was here that the Prince
of Orange landed in 1688, and a monument in the market-place commemorates the event, the identical
block of stone on which he first stepped being preserved.

THE DART.

Southward of this promontory is the estuary of the Dart, a river which, like nearly all the
streams of Devonshire, rises in that great "mother of rivers," Dartmoor, whence come the Tawe
and the Teign, of which we have already spoken, and also the Torridge, the Yealm, the Erme,
the Plym, and the Avon (still another of them). This celebrated moor covers an area of about
one hundred and thirty thousand acres, stretching thirty-three miles in length and twenty-two
miles in breadth, and its elevation averages seventeen hundred feet, though some of its tors,
the enormous rocks of granite crowning its hills, rise considerably higher, the loftiest of
these, the Yes Tor, near Okehampton, being two thousand and fifty feet high. The moor is composed
of vast stretches of bog and stunted heather, with plenty of places where peat is cut, and
having its streams filled with trout. Legend tells us that all manner of hill-and water-spirits
frequent this desolate yet attractive region, and that in Cranmore Pool and its surrounding
bogs, whence the Dart takes its rise, there dwelt the "pixies" and the "kelpies." The head-fountains
of both the Dart and the Plym are surrounded with romance, as the cities at their mouths are
famous in English history, and Spenser, in the Faerie Queene, announces that both Dart and
Plym were present at the great feast of the rivers which celebrated the wedding of the Thames
and Medway. The courses of the Dartmoor rivers are short, but with rapid changes. In the moorland
they run through moss and over granite; then among woods and cultivated fields, till, with
constantly broadening stream, the river joins the estuary or tidal inlet, and thus finds its
vent in the ocean. Strangely enough, with these short streams there are high points on the
Dartmoor tors from which both source and mouth of a river are visible at the same time. The
Dart, with steadily-increasing flow, thus runs out of the moorland, and not far from its edge
passes the antique town of Totnes, where the remains of an ivy-mantled wall upon the hill is
all that is left of Judhael's famous castle, which dates from the Norman Conquest. The surrounding
country is remarkably picturesque, and is noted for its agricultural wealth. About two miles
to the eastward is the romantic ruin of Berry Pomeroy Castle, founded upon a rock which rises
almost perpendicularly from a narrow valley, through which a winding brook bubbles. It is overhung
with foliage and shrubbery and mantled with moss and ivy, so that it is most attractive. The
great gate, the southern walls, part of a quadrangle, and a few turrets are all that remain
of the castle, which suffered severely in the Civil War. Tradition states that the adjacent
village was destroyed by lightning. This castle also dates from the Norman Conquest, and passed
from its original possessors, the Pomeroys, to Protector Somerset, the Duke of Somerset being
the present owner.

The Dart, which is a rocky stream above Totnes and a favorite resort of the fisherman and sketcher,
becomes navigable below the town, and has a soft, peculiar beauty of its own that has made
it often compared to the Rhine; but there is little comparison between them: the Dart has no
precipitous cliffs or vine-clad hills, and no castle excepting at its mouth. From Totnes to
Dartmouth is about twelve miles, through exquisitely beautiful scenery, especially where the
river passes the woods of Sharpham, the current narrowing to about one hundred and fifty feet,
and flowing through an amphitheatre of overarching trees rising in masses of foliage to the
height of several hundred feet. The stream makes various sharp bends--a paradise for the artist--and
finally it broadens out into an estuary like an inland lake, with a view over the intervening
neck of land to Torbay, and beyond the coast-line at Exmouth and towards Portland. Thus we
come to Dartmouth, the old houses built tier above tier on a steep hill running up from the
harbor, while at the extreme point of the promontory, guarding the entrance to the estuary,
is the little church of St. Petrox, with its armorial gallery and ruins of an ancient manor
house, and the castle, consisting of a square and a round tower, coming down from Henry VII.'s
reign, when it was built for coast-defence. On the opposite point of the harbor-entrance are
the foundations of another castle, evidently built about the same time. Dartmouth in early
times was a port of great importance, and Edward III. first gave it a charter under the name
of Clifton-Dartmouth-Hardness. Its merchants were then numerous and wealthy, and Coeur de Leon's
crusaders assembled their fleet in the harbor in 1190. The French destroyed both it and Plymouth
in 1377, and in 1403 the two towns, combining, ravaged the French coasts and burned forty ships.
The French retaliated the next year, but Dartmouth was too much for them, killing Du Chastel,
the commander, and defeating his expedition. It suffered severely in the Civil War, and there
are still traces of the land-fastenings of the iron chain stretched across the harbor to keep
out the French.

THE PLYM.

Westward of the valley of the Dart is the valley of the Plym, also flowing out of Dartmoor.
Two streams known as the Cad and the Mew join to form this river, and though they are of about
equal importance, the source of the Cad is generally regarded as the true Plym head, while
a crossing upon it is known as the Plym Steps. Both are rocky, dashing mountain-streams, and
such are also the characteristics of the Plym after the junction until it enters its estuary.
The Plym Head is within the royal forest of Dartmoor, about twelve hundred feet above the sea,
and in the wild and lonely moorland. The stream flows by the flat summit of Sheeps Tor, one
of the chief peaks on the southern border of the moor. Here in a hollow formed by overhanging
rocks one of the Royalist Elfords, whose house was under the tor, sought refuge, and amused
his solitude by painting the walls of the cavern, which is known as the "Pixies' House," and
is regarded by the neighbors as a dangerous place for children, to whom these little fairies
sometimes take a fancy. It is not safe, they say, to go near it without dropping a pin as an
offering between the chinks of the rock--not a very costly way of buying immunity. In Sheeps
Tor churchyard in the valley below lies Sir James Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak, who died near there
in 1868. As the streams course down the hillside they disclose frequent traces of the rude
stone relics left there by an ancient people, the chief being the settlement at Trowlesworthy,
where there is a circular hut enclosure about four hundred feet in diameter, with stone avenues
leading to it and the entrances defended by portions of walls. The stones are nowhere large,
however, rarely exceeding five feet high. Then we come to Shaugh, where the rivers struggle
through rocky ravines and finally join their waters. The little Shaugh church crowns the granite
rocks on one side, while on the other is the towering crag of the Dewerstone. This ivy-clad
rock, which lifts its furrowed and wrinkled battlements far above the Plym, was the "Rock of
Tiw," that powerful god of the Saxons from whom comes the name of Tuesday. Once, we are told,
in the deep snow traces of a human foot and a cloven hoof were found ascending to the highest
point of the rock, which His Satanic Majesty seems to have claimed for his own domain. From
this lofty outpost of the moor, if he stayed there, our all-time enemy certainly had a wide
lookout. On the one hand is a grand solitude, and on the other a hilly country stretches to
the seaboard, with the river-valley winding through woods and fields, and Plymouth Sound and
its breakwater in the distance. Here, below the junction of the two streams, are the scant
remains of the old house of Grenofen, whose inmates lived in great state, and were the Slannings
who so ardently supported King Charles. A mossy barn with massive gables is the prominent feature
of the ruins. The river runs down through the very beautiful vale of Bickleigh, and then under
Plym Bridge, where it becomes broader and more tranquil as it approaches the head of the estuary.
This region belonged to the priory of Plympton, and its Augustinian owners raised at the end
of the bridge a small chapel where the traveller might pause for prayer before venturing into
the solitudes beyond. The remains of this structure, however, are now slight. At Plympton St.
Mary was the priory, and at Plympton Earl the castle of the Earls of Devon, a brook flowing
between them to the river. Both stand near the head of the estuary, and are in ruins. The priory
was the wealthiest monastic house in Devon, but the castle was only important as the head-quarters
of Plymouth's Royalist besiegers in the Civil War. The priory was the nurse of the noted port
of Plymouth, and its earlier beginnings can be traced to the fostering care of the Augustinians,
who developed the fishing-town that subsequently became the powerful seaport. Plympton, the
old rhyme tells us, was "a borough-town" when Plymouth was little else than a "a furzy down."
The priory was founded in the twelfth century, and was long patronized by the neighboring Earls
of Devon. The Augustinians, legend says, were the first to cultivate the apple in Devonshire,
and the ruins still disclose the moss-grown "apple-garth." Little remains of the monastery
beyond the old refectory doorway and walls. The town of Plympton Maurice is in the valley near
by, famous as the birthplace of Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1723, but the house has been swept away,
though the grammar-school in which his father taught remains. Reynolds is said to have made
good use of the recollections of the grand scenery around his birthplace in furnishing landscape
backgrounds for his pictures. The town afterwards elected him mayor, though he rarely visited
his birthplace, but in lieu sent the corporation his portrait painted by himself. Here begins
the broad estuary known as the Laira, at the mouth of which stands Plymouth, the town covering
the land between the Laira and the Hamoaze, the estuary of the Tamar, with its adjoining suburbs
of Stonehouse and Devonport. Here are now a population of two hundred thousand, while the station
is of vast importance as a government dockyard and barracks, with a chain of strong protecting
fortifications for defence from attacks both by sea and land. Along the southern bank of the
estuary extend the woods of Saltram, the seat of the Earl of Morley. Then we come to Catwater
Haven, crowded with merchant-ships, and the older harbor of Sutton Pool. Mount Batten on one
side and Citadel Point on the other guard the entrance to the haven. It was here that the English
fleet awaited the Armada in 1588; that Essex gathered his expedition to conquer Cadiz in 1596;
and from here sailed the Mayflower with the Pilgrim Fathers in 1620. Plymouth harbor's maritime
and naval history is, however, interwoven with that of England.

PLYMOUTH.

The port of Plymouth comprises what are called the "Three Towns"--Plymouth proper, covering
about a square mile, Stonehouse, and Devonport, where the great naval dockyard is located.
Plymouth Sound is an estuary of the English Channel, and receives the Plym at its north-eastern
border and the Tamar at its north-western, the sound being about three miles square and protected
by the great breakwater a mile long, with a lighthouse, and defended by forts. The Plym broadens
into the Catwater, used as a haven for merchant-vessels and transports and capable of furnishing
anchorage to a thousand ships at one time. The Tamar broadens into the Hamoaze, which is the
naval harbor, and is four miles long, with sufficient anchorage-ground for the entire British
navy. Sutton Pool is a tidal harbor now used by merchant-vessels. The coasts of Plymouth Sound
are rocky and abrupt, and strong fortresses frown at every entrance. It is the naval dockyard
that gives Plymouth its chief importance: this is at Devonport, which is strongly fortified
by breastworks, ditches, embankments, and heavy batteries. The great dockyard encloses an area
of ninety-six acres and has thirty-five hundred feet of water-frontage. There are here five
docks and also building-slips, where the great British war-ships are constructed. Another enclosure
of seventy-two acres at Point Keyham is used for repairing ships, and a canal seventy feet
wide runs through the yards to facilitate the movement of materials. Immense roofs cover the
docks. East of Devonport, divided from it by a creek, and adjoining Plymouth, is Stonehouse.
Here are the great victualling yard, marine barracks, and naval hospital. The Royal William
Victualling Yard occupies fourteen acres on a tongue of land at the mouth of the Tamar, and
cost $7,500,000 to build. Here the stores are kept and naval supplies furnished, its great
features being the vast government bakehouse, the cooperage, and the storehouses. Its front
is protected by a redoubt, and to the eastward are the tasteful grounds of the Earl of Mount
Edgcumbe's winter villa. The marine barracks, which have the finest mess-room in England, will
accommodate fifteen hundred men; the naval hospital, northward of Stonehouse, will furnish
beds for twelve hundred. There are three thousand men employed about these great docks and
stores, and they form the most extensive naval establishment in the world. Near Mount Wise
are the Raglan Barracks, where there is a display of cannon taken from the Turks.

In Plymouth Sound is a bold pyramidal rock, the Isle of St. Nicholas, which is a formidable
fortress. Mount Edgcumbe is on the western shore, and on the eastern side is Plymouth's pretty
park, known as the Hoe, where the old Eddystone Lighthouse will be set up. Having come down
the Plym, we will now ascend the Tamar, past the huge docks and stores, and about five miles
above see the great Albert Bridge, which carries a railway, at a height of one hundred feet,
from the hills of Devon over to those of Cornwall on the western shore. It is built on nineteen
arches, two broad ones of four hundred and fifty-five feet span each bridging the river, the
entire structure being two thousand two hundred and forty feet long. Out in the English Channel,
fourteen miles from Plymouth, is its famous beacon--the Eddystone Lighthouse. Here Winstanley
perished in the earlier lighthouse that was swept away by the terrible storm of 1703, and here
Smeaton built his great lighthouse in 1759, one hundred feet high, which has recently been
superseded by the new lighthouse. The Eddystone Rocks consist of twenty-two gneiss reefs extending
about six hundred and fifty feet, in front of the entrance to Plymouth Sound. Smeaton's lighthouse,
modelled after the trunk of a sturdy oak in Windsor Park, became the model for all subsequent
lighthouses. It is as firm to-day as when originally built, but the reef on which it rests
has been undermined and shattered by the joint action of the waves and the leverage of the
tall stone column, against which the seas strike with prodigious force, causing it to vibrate
like the trunk of a tree in a storm. The foundation-stone of the new lighthouse was laid on
a reef one hundred and twenty-seven feet south of the old one in 1878. It is built of granite
and rises one hundred and thirty-eight feet above the rock, its light being visible seventeen
miles: it was first lighted May 18, 1882.

TAVISTOCK.

A short distance up the Tamar it receives its little tributary the Tavy, running through a
deep ravine, and on its banks are the ruins of Tavistock Abbey, founded in the tenth century
and dedicated to St. Mary. Orgarius, the Earl of Devonshire, was admonished in a dream to build
it, but his son Ordulph finished it. He was of great strength and gigantic stature, could break
down gates and stride across a stream ten feet wide. They still preserve, we are told, some
of Ordulph's huge bones in Tavistock Church. The Danes plundered and burned the abbey, but
it was rebuilt in greater splendor, and its abbot sat in the House of Peers. When it was disestablished,
like Woburn it fell to Lord Russell, and it is now owned by the Duke of Bedford. The remains
of the grand establishment, however, are but scanty, and its best memory is that of the printing-press
set up by the monks, which was the second press established in England. The Duke of Bedford's
attractive villa of Endsleigh is near Tavistock, and a short distance south of the town is
Buckland Abbey, built on the river-bank by the Countess of Devon in the thirteenth century.
This was the home of Sir Francis Drake, and is still held by his descendants. Drake was born
in a modest cottage on the banks of the Tavy about the year 1539. North of Tavistock, on the
little river Lyd, are the ruins of Lydford Castle, surrounded by a village of rude cottages.
Here originated the "law of Lydford," a proverb expressive of hasty judgment:

  "First hang and draw,
  Then hear the cause by Lydford law."

One chronicler accounts for this proverb by the wretched state of the castle jail, in which
imprisonment was worse than death. At Lydford is a remarkable chasm where a rude arch is thrown
across an abyss, at the bottom of which, eighty feet below, the Lyd rattles along in its contracted
bed. This is a favorite place for suicides, and the tale is still told of a benighted horseman,
caught in a heavy storm, who spurred his horse along the road at headlong speed to seek shelter
in the village. Next day it was found that the storm had swept the bridge away, and the rider
shuddered to think how his horse on that headlong ride through the tempest had leaped over
the abyss without his knowing it.

THE NORTHERN COAST OF DEVON.

Exmoor is a broad strip of almost mountainous moorland extending through the northern borders
of Somerset and Devon and down to the coast of Bristol Channel. Its hills descend precipitously
to the sea, so that only small brooks flow northward from them, excepting the Lyn, which manages
to attain the dignity of a river by flowing for some distance among the hills parallel to the
coast. It was but recently that good roads were constructed across this lonely moor, and on
its northern edge, where the craggy headland of Greenaleigh is thrust out into the sea, is
the harbor of Minehead, with a little fishing-village skirting its shores. A short distance
inland, and seated at the bases of the steep Brendon Hills, which rise in sharp wooded slopes
above its houses, is the little market-town of Dunster. On an outlying hill, projecting from
the mass, the original lord of Dunster built his castle, perching it upon a rocky crag that
Nature herself designed for a fortress. The Saxons called it their "Hill-tower." Its picturesque
mass of buildings is of various dates, but much more modern than their early day, most of the
present structure having been built in Queen Elizabeth's reign. The castle was held for King
Charles in the Civil War, and besieged by the Parliamentary troops, whose commander sent this
bloodthirsty message to its governor: "If you will deliver up the castle, you shall have fair
quarter: if not, expect no mercy: your mother shall be in front to receive the first fury of
your cannon." The governor promptly and bravely replied, "If you do what you threaten, you
do the most barbarous and villainous act that was ever done. My mother I honor, but the cause
I fight for and the masters I serve are God and the king.--Mother, do you forgive me, and give
me your blessing, and let the rebels answer for spilling that blood of yours, which I would
save with the loss of mine own if I had enough for both my master and yourself." The mother
also without hesitation answered him: "Son, I forgive thee, and pray God to bless thee, for
this brave resolution. If I live I shall love thee the better for it: God's will be done!"
Whether the atrocious threat would have been put into execution was never decided, for a strong
Royalist force soon appeared, routing the besiegers, capturing a thousand of them, and releasing
the lady. But the castle was soon afterwards taken for the Parliament by Colonel Blake, subsequently
the admiral. It was then demolished, and now the summit of the flat-topped hill, where formerly
was the keep, is devoted to the peaceful amusement of a bowling-green, from which there are
exquisite views of the Brendon Hills and far away over the Bristol Channel to the distant coast
of Wales. It was at Dunster Castle that William Prynne was shut up a prisoner by Cromwell.
Prynne had been pilloried, shorn of his ears, and imprisoned by King Charles I. for his denunciations
of the court, and then indulging in the same criticism of the Protector, he was confined at
Dunster. It is now the head-quarters for those who love the exciting pleasures of stag-hunting
on Exmoor.

Journeying westward over the hills from Minehead, which is just now endeavoring, though with
only partial success, to convert itself into a fashionable watering-place, Dunkery Beacon is
seen raising its head inland--a brown, heathy moorland elevated seventeen hundred feet above
the sea. There is a grand panorama disclosed from its summit, though it is a toilsome ascent
to get up there and overlook the fifteen counties it can display. Far below is the level shore
of Porlock Bay, with the little village set in at the base of the cliffs. Here Southey was
sheltered at its inn, and wrote a sonnet while he was "by the unwelcome summer rain detained;"
and here the village has slept ever since the Danes harried and Harold burned it. Then the
road climbs laboriously up the hill again to Porlock Moor, and as the top is reached, far away
is seen a little grassy basin running like a streak off towards the north-west, and enclosed
by steep hills, in which it is ultimately lost. This is the valley of the Lyn, and joining
it is another little glen, with a hamlet of white cottages at the junction: this is the Oare
valley, the centre of some of the most stirring traditions of Exmoor, embodied in Blackmore's
novel of Lorna Doone. Two centuries ago a lawless clan established themselves in this lonely
glen, from which issues the Bagworthy Water not far away from the little village of Oare. Here
was Jan Ridd's farm, and near it the cataract of the Bagworthy Water-slide, while above this
cataract, in the recesses of Doone Glen, was the robbers' home, whence they issued to plunder
the neighboring country. The novel tells how Jan Ridd, who was of herculean strength, was standing
with his bride Lorna at the altar of the little church in Oare when a bullet wounded her. Out
rushed Jan from the presence of his wife, dead as he thought, to pursue the murderer. He was
unarmed, and rode after him over the moorland, tearing from an oak a mighty bough as he passed
under it. To this day the rent in "Jan Ridd's tree" is shown. Then came the struggle, and an
Exmoor bog swallowed up the murderer, who was the last of the robber chieftains; and afterwards
the bride recovered and the happy pair were united. Exmoor is the only place remaining in the
kingdom where the wild stag is still hunted with hounds, the season being in the early autumn,
when all the inns are crowded, and on the day of a "meet" all the country seems alive.

LYNTON AND LYNMOUTH.

From Oare the valley of the Lyn can be followed down to the sea, flowing through its wooded
gorge and disclosing many pretty views. It runs rapidly over the rocks, and, when at last seeking
the sea, the little stream manages to escape out of the hills that have so long encompassed
it, we again find coupled together an upper and a lower town--Lynton, perched hundreds of feet
above on the crags, and Lynmouth, down by the water's edge, both in grandly picturesque locations.
Crowded between the bases of the crags and the pebbly beach is the irregular line of old cottages
beside the bubbling stream, with creeping vines climbing over their walls and thatched roofs,
while beyond is thrust out the ancient pier that made the port of Lynmouth. Up on the crags,
with houses nestling here in nooks and perched there upon cliffs, Lynton mounts by zigzag paths,
until, on a rocky terrace above, it gets room to spread into a straggling street. The two streams
called the East and West Lyn unite here before seeking the sea, and join their currents at
the edge of the town.

Southey rapturously described the East Lyn Vale as the "finest spot, except Cintra and Arrabida,
that I ever saw." It is like a miniature glen in the Alps or the Pyrenees, and every turn in
the road up to the Waters-meet, where the Brendon joins the Lyn, discloses new beauties. It
is an exquisite combination of wood, rock, and stream that baffles all description. Gentle
flowers grow here to luxuriant perfection, protected from all chilling blasts and with ample
moisture to assist the sunshine in their cultivation. But barely a mile east of Lynton on the
coast there is told a different story: there is a valley of rocks, where between two ridges
of hills the vale is covered with stones and almost completely laid bare, a terrific mass of
boulders, the very skeleton of the earth. Overhanging the sea is the gigantic "Castle Rock,"
while facing it from the inland side, at an elbow of the valley, is a queer pile of crags known
as the "Devil's Cheese-Ring." From the castle is a view over the sea and of the romantic towns,
with the little river flowing alongside and the tower on Lynmouth beach, while far westward
the moorland spreads away towards those other romantic spots, Ilfracombe and Clovelly.

COMBE MARTIN AND ILFRACOMBE.

Let us skirt along the precipitous Devonshire coast westward from the Lyn, where the cliffs
rise high and abruptly from the water, with foliage on the hills above them and sheep browsing
like little white specks beyond. Thus Exmoor is prolonged westward in a broad and lofty ridge
of undulating hills, through which a stream occasionally carves its devious course in a deep
and sheltered valley that comes out to the sea between bold, rocky headlands. Far out over
the sea loom up the coasts of Wales in purple clouds. Soon in a breach in the wall of crags
we find Combe Martin, its houses dotted among the gardens and orchards clustering thickly around
the red stone church. Here were silver-mines long ago, and here lived Martin of Tours, to whom
William the Conqueror granted the manor which to this day bears his name. The neighboring hills
grow the best hemp in Devon, and the crags guarding the harbor are known as the Great and Little
Hangman, the former, which is the higher, standing behind the other. The local tradition says
that once a fellow who had stolen a sheep was carrying the carcase home on his back, having
tied the hind legs together around his neck. He paused for breath at the top of the hill, and,
resting against a projecting slab, poised the carcase on the top, when it suddenly slipped
over and garroted him. He was afterwards found dead, and thus named the hills. Near here was
born, in 1522, Bishop Jewel of Salisbury, of whom it is recorded by that faithful biographer
Fuller that he "wrote learnedly, preached painfully, lived piously, died peacefully." To the
westward are Watersmouth, with its natural arch in the slaty rocks bordering the sea, and Hillsborough
rising boldly to guard a tiny cove. Upon this precipitous headland is an ancient camp, and
it overlooks Ilfracombe, the chief watering-place of the northern Devonshire coast. Here a
smart new town has rapidly developed, with paths cut upon the cliffs and encroachments made
along the shore. High upon a pyramidal headland stands the ancient chapel where in the olden
time the forefathers of the village prayed to St. Nicholas for deliverance from shipwreck.
Now a lighthouse is relied on for this service. The promontory is connected with a still bolder
and loftier headland, the Capstone Rock. The town is built on the slope of the hills overlooking
these huge round-topped crags, but its streets do not run down to sand-beaches. There is little
but rocks on the shore and reefs in the water, worn into ridges of picturesque outline, over
which the surf breaks grandly in time of storm. We are told that in a cave near by, Sir William
Tracy, one of the murderers of St. Thomas à Becket at Canterbury, concealed himself while waiting
to escape from England. He and his accomplices were ordered to purge themselves by a pilgrimage
to the Holy Land, but Tracy was not able to accomplish it. The winds of heaven always drove
him back whenever he tried to embark, for he had struck the first blow at Becket. He was buried
in Morthoe Church beyond Ilfracombe.

MORTE POINT AND BIDEFORD.

A few miles westward the coast-line suddenly bends to the southward, the angle being marked
by a wild, rocky headland known as Morte Point, which the Devonshire proverb describes as "the
place on earth which Heaven made last and the devil will take first." It is a chaos of rock-ridges,
the sea washing against it on three sides, and is a noted place for wrecks. Far out at sea
can be seen a half-submerged black rock which the Normans christened the Morte Stone, or "Death
Rock." To the southward sweeps a fringe of yellow sand around Morte Bay, and behind the headland
is the little village of Morthoe, where Tracy is buried. Beyond the boundary of the bay, at
Baggy Point, is another and broader bay, whose shores make a grand sweep to the westward again.
This is Barnstaple Bay, into which flows a wide estuary forming the outlet of two rivers: the
northernmost is the Taw, and at the head of its estuary is Barnstaple. The other is the Torridge,
and upon it, at about nine miles distance from Barnstaple, is the small but prettier town of
Bideford. This is described by Kingsley as a little white town, sloping upward from its broad
tidal river, paved with yellow sands, and having a many-arched old bridge towards the uplands
to the westward. The wooded hills close in above the town, but in front, where the rivers join,
they sink into a hazy level of marsh and low undulations of sand. The town has stood almost
as it is now since Grenvil, the cousin of William the Conqueror, founded it. It formerly enjoyed
great commercial prosperity under the patronage of the Grenvilles, reaching its height in the
seventeenth century. The old quay remains. The ancient bridge, which is a remarkable one, was
built five hundred years ago, and is constructed on twenty-four piers, firmly founded, yet
shaking under the footstep. The superstitious say it is of miraculous origin, for when they
began to build it some distance farther up the river, each night invisible hands removed the
stones to their present position. It is also a wealthy bridge and of noble rank, having its
heraldic coat-of-arms (a ship and a bridge proper on a plain field) and owning broad estates,
with the income of which "the said miraculous bridge has from time to time founded chantries,
built schools, waged suits-at-law, and, finally, given yearly dinners, and kept for that purpose
the best-stocked cellar of wines in all Devon."

CLOVELLY.

The coast of Barnstaple Bay sweeps around to the westward again, and here, under the precipitous
crags, nestling in one of the most picturesque nooks in all England, is Clovelly. From an inland
plateau of considerable elevation the land falls steeply to the sea, with a narrow strip of
sand or shingle sometimes interposed, whereon the surf dashes before it reaches the rocks.
Dense foliage, with here and there a protruding crag, overhangs the cliffs. Ravines occasionally
furrow the rocky wall, and in one of these Clovelly is situated, beginning with some scattered
houses on the margin of the plateau above, descending the cliff in one steep street, and spreading
out about a miniature harbor on the edge of the sea. There are few such streets to be seen
elsewhere--not made for wheeled vehicles, but paved in a series of broad steps, over which
the donkeys and the population plod with the produce of the fleet of fishing-boats the village
owns. It is narrow, with strangely-shaped houses jumbled together alongside, and balconies
and bay-windows, chimneys and gables--all mixed up together. Here Kingsley spent most of his
boyhood, and hither flock the artists to paint odd pictures for almost every British art-exhibition.
Its little pier was built in Richard II.'s time, when as now it was a landing-place for the
mackerel-and herring-boats. This quay has recently been somewhat enlarged. Clovelly Court,
the home of the Careys, is near by, with its beautiful park extending out to the tall cliffs
overhanging the sea. On one craggy point, known as Gallantry Bower, and five hundred feet above
the waves, was an old watch-tower of the Normans, now reduced to a mere ring of stones; and
to the westward a few miles the bold rocks of Hartland Point mark another angle in the coast
as it bends southward towards Cornwall. Eleven miles out to sea, rising four hundred feet and
guarded all around by grim precipices, is Lundy Island. Here in a little cove are some fishermen's
huts, while up on the top is a lighthouse, and near it the ruins of the old Moresco Castle.
We have already referred to Sir Walter Raleigh's judicial murder: it was accomplished mainly
through the treachery of his near kinsman, Sir Lewis Stukely, then vice-admiral of Devon. This
and other actions caused Stukely to be almost universally despised, and he was finally insulted
by Lord Howard of Effingham, when he complained to the king. "What should I do with him?" asked
James. "Hang him? On my sawl, mon, if I hung all that spoke ill of thee, all the trees in the
island were too few." Being soon afterwards detected in the royal palace debasing the coin,
he fled to Devon, a ruined man. But he found no friends, and, every door being closed against
him, he sailed out to Lundy Island, and died alone in a chamber of the ruined castle.

CORNWALL.

Pursuing the bold shores of Cornwall southward, we pass many crags and headlands, notably the
Duke of Cornwall Harbor, protected by high projecting cliffs, and just below find the ruins
of King Arthur's castle of Tintagel, located amid some of the most romantic scenery of this
grand line of coast. Here King Arthur is supposed to have been born, and the fortress, built
on a high rock almost surrounded by the sea, was evidently of great strength. Here on the shore
are King Arthur's Cliffs, and their attractions, with the little church of Tintagel and the
partly-ruined fishing-town of Bossiney, make the place a popular resort for poets and painters.
Not far away in the interior, and standing near the Tamar River on the top of a steep hill,
is Launceston Castle, with the town built on the adjacent slopes. The ruins, which are of great
antiquity, cover considerable surface, the walls being ten or twelve feet thick, and the keep
rising high upon the top of the hill, nearly one hundred feet in diameter. This keep is said
to have been an ancient British structure. Old Roman and also leather coins have been found
in it, and it was a renowned stronghold when William the Norman came to England and gave it
to Robert, Earl of Moreton. It now belongs to the Duchy of Cornwall. It was garrisoned for
King Charles in the Civil War, and was one of his last supports. Westward in Cornwall is Camelford,
over which frown the two Cornish mountains, Rowtor and Brown Willy, a short distance to the
southward, rising respectively thirteen hundred and thirteen hundred and eighty feet. The Cornish
range forms the backbone of the narrow peninsula which now juts out to the south-westward,
marking the extreme point of England, and down which we will gradually journey. Crossing the
mountains, we come to Liskeard, in a beautiful country filled with ancient Roman remains. Going
down to the southern coast, we reach Fowey with its picturesque harbor and pier, with the Sharpitor
and Kilmarth Mountains beyond, twelve hundred and twelve hundred and seventy-seven feet high
respectively. Fowey harbor, sheltered by high hills richly clothed with green, is the "haven
under the hill" of which the balladist sings, and near its quaint old pier, almost covered
with houses, is Fowey Church, recently effectually restored.

THE LIZARD PENINSULA.

The Cornish peninsula upon approaching its termination divides into two, with the semicircular
sweep of Mount's Bay between them. To the southward juts out the Lizard, and to the westward
Land's End. While the latter is the westernmost extremity of England, the Lizard is usually
the earliest headland that greets the mariner. The Lizard peninsula is practically almost an
island, the broad estuary of the Helford River on one side and a strange inlet called Loo Pool
on the other narrowing its connecting isthmus to barely two miles width. To the northward of
the Helford River is the well-known port of Falmouth. Inland are the great Cornwall tin-and
copper-mines, the former having been worked for centuries, while the latter are now probably
of the greater importance. Competition and the costlier working of the tin-mines have caused
many of them to be abandoned. These metals are mostly mined on the black moorlands, which offer
little attraction to the tourist, who gladly avoids them for the picturesque shores of Falmouth
harbor. A broad estuary guarded by bold headlands forms Carrick Roads, and the western one
of these also guards the entrance to Falmouth harbor, which Leland describes as being in his
day "the principal haven of all Britain." Though long frequented, however, no town stood on
its shores until the seventeenth century. When Raleigh came back from his voyage to Guiana
there was but a single house on the shore, where his crew were lodged, and he, being impressed
with the advantages of the location for a port, laid before Queen Elizabeth a plan for the
foundation of a town. But it was a long while before anything came of it, and the place was
not named Falmouth or incorporated until the reign of Charles II. It became a post-office packet-station
for the Atlantic ports in the last century, and Byron in his day described it as containing
"many Quakers and much salt fish." Its Cornish name is Pen-combick, meaning "the village in
the hollow of the headland," which has been corrupted by the mariner into "Penny-come-quick,"
because on one occasion the landlady of the solitary inn sold the liquor engaged for a party
of visitors to a parcel of thirsty Dutch sailors who had just landed, and, being taken to task
for it explained that the "penny come so quick" she could not deny them. Pendennis Castle guards
the entrance to Carrick Roads, and was built by Henry VIII., being enlarged by Elizabeth. It
and Raglan were the last castles holding out for King Charles. Lightning greatly injured Pendennis
in the last century. On the opposite portal of the harbor stands St. Mawe's Castle. The ramparts
of Pendennis afford a view of extreme beauty.

On the narrow neck of land uniting the Lizard peninsula to the mainland stands Helston, formerly
guarded by a castle that has long since disappeared, and named, we are told, from the great
block of granite that once formed the portal of the infernal regions. The master of those dominions
once, when he went abroad, carried his front door with him, and was met in this neighborhood
by St. Michael, whereupon there was a "bit of a fight" between the two adversaries. His Satanic
Majesty was defeated, and, dropping his front door, fled. The great boulder, which thus named
the town, is built into a wall back of the Angel Inn, and they hold an annual festival on May
8th to commemorate the event. Loo Pool cuts deeply into the land to the westward of Helston,
and the district south of it is an elevated plateau, bare and treeless generally, but containing
many pretty glens, while the shore is lined with sequestered coves. Here grow the Cornish heath-flowers,
which are most beautiful in the early autumn, while the serpentine rocks of its grand sea-cliffs,
relieved by sparkling golden crystals and veins of green, red, and white, make fine ornaments.
Upon the coast, southward from Helston, is Mullyon Cove, a characteristic specimen of the Lizard
scenery. A glen winds down to the sea, displacing the crags to get an outlet, and disclosing
their beautiful serpentine veins. A pyramidal rock rises on one hand, a range of serpentine
cliffs on the other, and a flat-topped island in front. In the serpentine cliffs is the portal
of a cave that can be penetrated for over two hundred feet, and was a haunt of the smugglers
in former days, the revenue officers generally winking at them for a share of the spoils. We
are told that in the last century the smugglers here had six vessels, manned by two hundred
and thirty-four men and mounting fifty-six cannon--a formidable fleet--and when Falmouth got
a collector sufficiently resolute to try to break them up, they actually posted handbills offering
rewards for his assassination. At one place on shore they had a battery of six-pounders, which
did not hesitate to fire on the king's ships when they became too inquisitive. The coast is
full of places about which tales are told of the exploits of the smugglers, but the crime has
long since become extinct there because it no longer pays. South of Mullyon are the bold headlands
of Pradanack Point and Vellan Head, while beyond we come to the most noted spot on the Lizard
peninsular coast.

KYNANCE COVE AND LIZARD HEAD.

Kynance Cove is the opening of one of the many shallow valleys indenting the inland plateau,
with crags and skerries thrown over the sea, showing that the cliffs on the shore have not,
as usual, maintained an unbroken front to the waves, but have been knocked about in wild confusion.
Groups of islands dot the cove; Steeple Rock rears its solitary pinnacle aloft; the Lion Rock
crouches near the southern verge. It is as wild a place as can well be imagined, and at low
water strips of sand connect these rocks with the mainland, though the quickly-rising waters
often compel the visitor to run for it. At the water's edge, when the tide is low, little wave-worn
caverns are disclosed in the cliffs which are known as the "Drawing-Room," the "Parlor," etc.
On the smooth face of the landward slope of one of the larger islands there are two orifices
looking like the slit of a letter-box. The upper is called the "Post-Office," and the lower
one the "Bellows." If you hold a sheet of paper in the former a gust of air will suddenly suck
it into the aperture. Then if you look into the "Post-Office" to investigate its secrets, a
column of spray will as suddenly deluge you with a first-class shower-bath. This is on Asparagus
Island, and by climbing to the top of the rock the mystery is solved. The rock is almost severed
by a fissure opening towards the sea: a wave surges in and spurts from the orifices on the
landward side, then recedes and sucks the air back through them. From the cove at Kynance down
to the extremity of the Lizard the scenery is everywhere fine. Here is the southernmost extremity
of England, there being three headlands jutting into the sea near one another, the westernmost
being the Old Lizard Head. Upon the middle one are the lighthouses that warn the mariner. Black
cliffs above, and a sea studded with reefs below, give this place a forbidding aspect. One
of the reefs is known as "Man-of-War Rock," from the wreck of a vessel there, and the weapons
cast upon the neighboring shore gave it the name of the "Pistol Meadow." The other headland
supports a telegraph-station, and a submarine cable goes down into the sea, to reappear again
upon the distant shores of Portugal. From here the signals are sent that give notice of arriving
ships. Beneath the cliffs rises out of the sea that strange black crag, looking like a projecting
pulpit, which is known as the Bumble Rock. In the green sward above the cliffs a yawning gulf
opens its rocky mouth, and is called the Lion's Den. It terminates in a rocky tunnel which
communicates with the sea through a natural archway. This was a cavern, the rocky roof of which
fell in about thirty-five years ago. Nestling under the middle headland is the tiny port of
Polpeor, the little harbor of the Lizard, a fishermen's paradise in a small way. Around on
the eastern coast of the peninsula the rocks are also fine, and here are the fishing-villages
of Lizard Town and Landewednack, the latter having a strange old church, reputed to be the
last in which a sermon was preached in the Cornish tongue. The grave of one of the rectors
tells that he lived to be one hundred and twenty years old, for people live long in this delicious
climate. These villages are devoted to the pilchard-fishery, and during the season the lookout-men
can be seen perched on the cliffs watching for the approach of a shoal, to warn the fishing-boats
that are ready to put to sea from the sheltered coves below. Great crags are tumbled into the
ocean, and the coast abounds in caves, with occasionally a quarry for the serpentine. Beyond
can be traced the dim outline of the headlands guarding Falmouth entrance. This is a unique
district, whose rock-bound coast is a terror to the mariner, but a delight to the geologist
and artist, and whose recesses, where the Cornish dialect still flourishes among the old folk,
are about the only places in England not yet penetrated by the railway, which has gridironed
the British kingdom everywhere else.

ST. MICHAEL'S MOUNT.

The western peninsula of Cornwall juts far out beyond Mount's Bay, which acquires its name
from what is probably the most remarkable crag in all this wonderful region. This was the Iktis
of the ancient geographers, an object so conspicuous as to attract attention in all ages. It
is a mass of granite rising from the sands, covering about twenty-five acres, and the top of
the church which crowns it is elevated two hundred and thirty-eight feet. It is impossible
by either pen or pencil to give an adequate idea of St. Michael's Mount--of the shattered masses
of the rock itself, its watch-turrets and batteries, the turf and sea-plants niched in its
recesses, and the gray, lichen-covered towers that rise from the summit. Cornish tradition
says that the giant Cormoran built the first fortress here; and he is one of those unfortunate
giants whose fate is told under the name of Corincus in the veritable history of Jack the Giant-killer.
The archangel St. Michael afterwards appeared to some hermits on its rocks, and this gave the
mount its religious character and name.

It was always a strongly-defended place, and became a Benedictine monastery--at first as an
offshoot of the greater abbey of St. Michael in Normandy, which in situation it resembles,
and afterwards as an independent establishment. It was a stronghold as well as a religious
house, however, and was notorious as the "back-door of rebellion," frequently besieged. The
crowning square tower is that of the monastic church, and St. Michael's Chair is on the battlements--a
stone beacon which is of great importance to all newly-married couples in that region, for
it bestows the ascendency on the husband or wife who first sits in it. It is of this chair
Southey's ballad about the adventurous Rebecca was written; and he tells that just as she was
installed.

  "Merrily, merrily rang the bells,
    And out Rebecca was thrown."

The family of St. Aubyn hold the mount, and they have recently thoroughly restored the buildings,
adding some fine apartments. It is accessible only when the receding tide leaves bare the natural
causeway that connects the island with the shore.

PENZANCE AND THE LAND'S END.

This whole peninsula is filled with hut-villages, cromlechs, and other prehistoric remains
of its ancient people, but we have not the space to devote to their description, however agreeable
it might be. Hill-castles and caves are also frequent, each with its traditions. The chief
town is Penzance, or the "Holy Headland," jutting out into Mount's Bay, where once was a chapel
dedicated to St. Anthony, who with St. Michael kept guard over this favored region. Here is
another prosperous seat of the pilchard-fishery, and among its people the favorite toast is
to the three Cornish products, "tin, fish, and copper." Once, they tell us, seventy-five millions
of these fish were caught in a single day. They rise in small shoals from the depths of the
sea, then unite into larger ones, and finally, about the end of July, combine in a mighty host,
led by the "Pilchard King" and most powerful of the tribe. The lookouts on the crags give warning,
and then begins the extraordinary migration that calls out all the Cornish fishermen. Pursued
by hordes of sea-birds and predatory fish, the pilchards advance towards the land in such vast
numbers as to discolor the water and almost to impede the passage of vessels. The enormous
fish-army passes the Land's End, a grand spectacle, moving along parallel to the shore, and
then comes the harvest. On the southward of the granite mass that forms the extremity of the
peninsula rises the Logan Rock, the entire headland being defended by remains of ancient intrenchments.
The Logan itself is a granite block weighing sixty tons, and so nicely balanced that it will
oscillate. Near here, as we go out towards the western extremity of the peninsula, are several
old churches, many ancient remains that have yielded up their chief curiosities for museums,
and remarkable cliffs projecting into the sea, the strangest of them being the "holed headland
of Penwith," a mass of columnar granite which the waves have shattered into deep fissures.
Then beyond is the Land's End itself, the most westerly point in England, with the rocks of
the Longships out in the water with their guardian lighthouse. The extreme point of the Land's
End is about sixty feet high and pierced by a natural tunnel, but the cliffs on each side rise
to a greater elevation. The faint outlines of the Scilly Islands are seen on the distant horizon,
but all else is a view over the boundless sea. The Land's End is a vast aggregation of granite,
which Sir Humphrey Davy, the Cornish chemist and poet, who was born at Penzance, has thus depicted:

                               "On the sea
  The sunbeams tremble, and the purple light
  Illumes the dark Bolerium: seat of storms;
  High are his granite rocks; his frowning brow
  Hangs o'er the smiling ocean. In his caves
  There sleep the haggard spirits of the storm.
  Wild, dreary, are the schistine rocks around,
  Encircled by the wave, where to the breeze
  The haggard cormorant shrieks; and far beyond,
  Where the great ocean mingles with the sky,
  Are seen the cloud-like islands gray in mists."

GUILDFORD.

Crossing over the Thames to the Surrey side, we proceed southward to that vast chalk-measure
which, like a miniature mountain-wall, divides the watershed draining into that river from
the Weald of Sussex and of Kent. This chalky hill is here and there breached by the valley
of a stream, and through it the Wey and the Mole, to which we have heretofore referred, flow
northward to join the current of the Thames. In the gap formed by each there is a town, Guildford
standing alongside the Wey, and Dorking on the Mole. Both develop magnificent scenery on the
flanks of the chalk-ranges that surround them; and we will now go about thirty miles south-west
from London and visit Guildford, whose origin is involved in the mystery that surrounds the
early history of so many English towns. It was a royal manor in the days of King Alfred, being
granted to his nephew, and it was here a few years before the Norman Conquest that the ætheling
Ælfred was captured. Harold, the son of Canute, wished to destroy him to secure the succession
to the throne. He forged a letter purporting to be from his mother, Queen Emma, inviting Ælfred
to come to England, and sent his minister Godwine forward, who met and swore allegiance to
Ælfred, lodging him at Guildford, and most of his comrades in separate houses there. In the
night Harold's emissaries suddenly appeared, slew his comrades, and carried Ælfred off to Ely,
where he was loaded with fetters, and, being tried by some sort of tribunal, was blinded and
then put to death. The monks of Ely enshrined his body, and of course miracles were wrought
by it. The castle was built on the Wey after the Norman Conquest, and Henry II. made it a park
and royal residence, so that it was long called the King's Manor. In Charles I.'s time it was
granted to the Earl of Annandale. The situation of Guildford is picturesque; the chalk-range
is narrowed to a line of steep, ridgy hills almost as straight as a wall and severed by the
valley of the Wey. This pretty stream escapes from the Weald to the southward between the Hog's
Back on the west and Albury Down on the east, the valley narrowing so as to form a natural
gateway just where the river emerges. A bridge was built here, and this determined the site
of the town, which straggles up the Hog's Back and the Down, and also spreads out in the broadening
valley of the emerging river. High up in the hills that make the eastern slope of the valley
is the old gray castle-keep, with an ancient church-tower lower down and a new church by the
waterside. From the bridge runs straight up this hill the chief thoroughfare of the town, High
Street. The shapeless ruins of the old castle, the keep alone being kept in good condition,
are not far away from the upper part of this street, crowning an artificial mound encompassed
by what once was a ditch, but now is chiefly a series of gardens. The ancient church-tower,
part way down the hill, is dedicated to St. Mary, but has been shorn of its original proportions
in order to widen a street. This was done, we are told, for the convenience of George IV.,
who used to pass in a coach along this street on his way from London to Brighton. The tower
is low and unassuming, and is supposed to date from the time of King Stephen. The new church
of St. Nicholas stands by the river, and Guildford also possesses another church built of brick.
None of these churches have spires, and therefore some local wit has written,

  "Poor Guildford, proud people;
  Three churches--no steeple."

The High Street climbs the hill past many quaint buildings, particularly the old town-hall,
where the hill is somewhat less steep. Its upper stories project beyond the lower, being supported
by carved beams, and the town-clock hangs over the street. Abbot's Hospital, built by Guildford's
most noted townsman, George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, is also in this street. He was
born in a humble cottage, and the legend tells us that his mother, before the event, dreamed
that if she could eat a pike she would have a son who would be a great man. She was unable
to buy the fish anywhere, but, drawing a pailful of water from the river, to her surprise found
a pike in it. When George was born the tale was told, and several distinguished people offered
to become his sponsors. They gave him a good education, and he graduated at Balliol College,
Oxford, and was made Dean of Westminster. He was one of the revisers of the Scriptures who
prepared the revision in the seventeenth century, was made a bishop, and in 1611 Archbishop
of Canterbury. His brother was Bishop of Salisbury, and another brother Lord Mayor of London.
He was a great hunter, as were most ecclesiastics at that time, and in 1621, when shooting
at a buck, his arrow accidentally pierced the arm of a gatekeeper, who soon bled to death.
The archbishop was horror-stricken, settled an annuity upon the widow, and to the close of
his life observed Tuesday, the day of the accident, as a weekly fast. This occurrence raised
a hot dispute in the Church as to whether the archbishop, by having blood on his hands, had
become incapable of discharging the duties of his sacred office. He retired to his hospital
at Guildford while the inquiry was conducted, was ultimately exonerated, and in 1625 died.
This hospital is built around a small quadrangle, and in its gateway-tower the unfortunate
"King Monmouth" was lodged on his last journey from Sedgemoor to London. Abbot, according to
the inscription on the walls, founded this charity for "a master, twelve brethren, and eight
sisters"--all to be unmarried and not less than sixty years of age, and chosen from Guildford,
preference to be given to "such as have borne office or been good traders in the town, or such
as have been soldiers sent, and who have ventured their lives or lost their blood for their
prince and country." The number of inmates is now increased, the endowment having accumulated.
Guildford used to maintain the piety of its people by requiring that all should attend church
and listen to a sermon, or else be fined a shilling. Over on the other side of the valley,
on a grassy spur protruding from the Hog's Back, are the ruins of St. Catharine's Chapel, built
in the fourteenth century. The local tradition tells that this and St. Martha's Chapel, on
an adjacent hill, were built by two sister-giantesses, who worked with a single hammer, which
they flung from hill to hill to each other as required. St. Catharine's Chapel long since fell
in ruins, and not far away on the slope, St. Catharine's Spring flows perennially. On Albury
Down is a residence of the Duke of Northumberland, Albury Park, laid out in the seventeenth
century by John Evelyn, famous for his devotion to rural beauties, and the residence during
the present century of Henry Drummond, the banker, politician, and theologian, the most caustic
critic of his time in Parliament, and the great promoter of the Church of the Second Advent.

ALDERSHOT CAMP.

A few miles to the westward, near Farnborough, over the border in Hampshire, is Aldershot Camp,
permanently established there in 1854. The Basingstoke Canal flows through a plateau elevated
about three hundred and twenty feet above the sea, and divides the location into a north and
south camp, the latter occupying much the larger surface and containing most of the public
buildings. On a central hillock covered by clumps of fir trees are the headquarters of the
general in command when the troops are being exercised and going through their manoeuvres.
The Long Valley stretches to the westward, terminating in a steep hill rising six hundred feet,
from which the best view of the military movements is had on a field-day. The two camps cover
about seven square miles, and they commonly contain about twelve thousand troops during the
season for the manoeuvres. There are long rows of wooden huts for the soldiers, and there are
also barracks, hospitals, and other necessary buildings, the cost of the establishment of this
military dépôt having exceeded $7,000,000 already. The annual reviews take place from June
to September, the regiments of volunteers being detailed in turn to co-operate with the regular
troops, so as to gain a practical knowledge of military duties.

DORKING.

Proceeding eastward along the chalk-hills for about twelve miles, we come to the breach made
in them by the valley of the Mole for the passage of that strange little river. Here, however,
appears a second and parallel range of hills, distant about four miles, the long and generally
flat-topped ridge culminating in the commanding summit of Leith Hill. This is the highest ground
in this part of England, rising nearly one thousand feet, a broad summit sloping gradually
down towards the north, but presenting to the south a steep and, in places, a precipitous ascent.
At its foot is the residence known as Leith Hill Place, where Mr. Hull lived in the last century,
and built the tower for an outlook that crowns its summit, leaving orders in his will that
he should be buried there. The tower was partially burned in 1877, but has been restored. The
view from the top of Leith Hill is grand, although it takes some exertion to get there, and
it discloses a panorama of typical English scenery over the white chalk-downs, dappled with
green and the darker woodland, with the Thames lowlands far away to the north, while to the
southward the land falls abruptly to the great valley of the Weald, a plain of rich red earth,
with woods and grainfields and hedgerows stretching away to the dim line of the South Downs
at the horizon. Pleasant little villas and old-time comfortable farm-houses are dotted all
about with their dovecotes and outbuildings. To the eastward is the Redlands Wood, crowned
by a tall silver fir, and just beyond is Holmwood Common, whereon donkeys graze and flocks
of geese patiently await the September plucking. Here, at Holmwood Park, is one of those ancient
yet still populous dovecotes that contribute so much to enhance the beauties of English rural
scenery.

Dorking lies in the valley of the Mole, just south of the high chalk-ranges, at the foot of
wooded hills, and with its bordering meadows stretching out to the river-bank. It is an ancient
town, appearing in the Domesday Book under the name of Dorchinges, and standing on the route
which Julius Cæsar took through these hills on his invasion of Britain. After the Norman Conquest
the manor became the property of Earl Warrenne, and as a favorite halting-place on the road
between London and the south coast in the Middle Ages it throve greatly and was noted for the
number of its inns. Its chief street--High Street--runs parallel with the chalk-hills, and
presents a picturesque variety of old-time houses, though none are of great pretensions. Among
them is the long, low structure, with a quaint entrance-gate in the middle, suggestive of the
days before railroads, and known as the "White Horse Inn." The ancient "Cardinal's Cap" has
been transformed into the "Red Lion Inn," and the "Old King's Head," the most famous of these
hostelries, has been removed to make room for the post-office. This latter inn was the original
of "The Marquis of Granby, Dorking," where that substantial person, Mr. Weller, Senior, lived,
and under the sway of Mrs. Weller the veteran coachman smoked his pipe and practised patience,
while the "shepherd" imbibed hot pineapple rum and water and dispensed spiritual consolation
to the flock. An old stage-coachman who lived years ago at Dorking is said to have been Dickens's
original for this celebrated character, and the townsfolk still talk of the venerable horse-trough
that stood in front of the inn wherein the bereaved landlord immersed Mr. Stiggins's head after
kicking him out of the bar. The Dorking fowls all have the peculiarity of an extra claw on
each foot, being white and speckled, and a Roman origin being claimed for the breed, which
is most delicate in flavor and commands a high price. On the southern outskirts of the town
is Deepdene, a mansion surrounded by magnificent trees and standing on the slope of a hill.
It was the home of the Hopes, its late owner, H. T. Hope, having been the author of the novel
Anastasius. He was a zealous patron of art, and first brought Thorwaldsen into public notice
by commissioning him to execute his "Jason" in marble. The house contains many rare gems of
sculpture, including Canova's "Venus Rising from the Bath," with paintings by Raphael, Paul
Veronese, and others. It was here that Disraeli wrote the greater part of Coningsby. A dene
or glade opening near the house gives the place its name, the grounds being extensive and displaying
gardens and fine woods. The scenery of this glade is beautiful, while from the terrace at the
summit of the hill, where there is a Doric temple, a magnificent view can be had far away over
the lowlands. Deepdene is attractive both within and without, for its grand collection of art-treasures
vies with Nature in affording delight to the visitor. The ruins of Betchworth Castle, built
four hundred years ago, are alongside the Mole. "The soft windings of the silent Mole" around
Betchworth furnished a theme for Thomson, while Milton calls it "the sullen Mole that runneth
underneath," and Pope, "the sullen Mole that hides his diving flood." Spenser has something
to say of the

  "----Mole, that like a nousling mole doth make
  His way still underground till Thames he overtake."

This peculiarity comes from the river hiding itself under Box Hill, where, after disappearing
for about two miles, it comes bubbling up out of the ground again. This disappearance of streams
in hilly regions is not unusual. Box Hill, beneath whose slopes the Mole passes, is part of
the great chalk-range rising steeply on the eastern side of the gap where the river-valley
breaks through. Its summit is elevated four hundred feet, the hill being densely wooded and
containing large plantations of box, whence its name. One of these box-groves covers two hundred
and thirty acres. On the brow of Box Hill, Major Labillière, a singular character, was buried
in 1800. He lived in Dorking, and, becoming convinced that the world had been turned topsy-turvy,
selected his grave, and gave instructions that he should be buried head downward, so that at
the final setting right of mundane affairs he would rise correctly. In the Mole Valley, at
the base of Box Hill, at a pretty little house called the "Fox and Hounds," Keats finished
his poem of Endymion, and here Lord Nelson spent his last days in England before leaving on
the expedition that closed with his greatest victory and death at Trafalgar.

Upon the hill on the western side of the gap is the Denbies, from which there is a view all
the way to London. At the back of this high hill is Ranmore Common. The Denbies are the scene
of the "Battle of Dorking," having been held by the English defensive army in that imaginary
and disastrous conflict wherein German invaders land upon the southern coasts, destroy the
British fleets by torpedoes, triumphantly march to the base of the chalk-ranges, fight a terrific
battle, force their way through the gaps in the hills, capture London, and dethrone England
from her high place among the great powers of Europe. This was a summer-time magazine article,
written to call English attention to the necessity of looking after the national defences;
and it had a powerful effect. Westward of Dorking there is fine scenery, amid which is the
little house known as the "Rookery," where Malthus the political economist was born in 1766.
Wotton Church stands alongside the road near by, almost hid by aged trees--a building of various
dates, with a porch and stunted tower. Here John Evelyn was taught when a child, and the graves
of his family are in a chapel opening from the north aisle. Wotton House, where Evelyn lived,
is in the adjacent valley and at the foot of the famous Leith Hill. His favorite pastime was
climbing up the hill to see over the dozen counties the view discloses, with the sea far away
to the southward on the Sussex coast. The house is an irregular brick building of various dates,
the earliest parts built in Elizabethan days, and it contains many interesting relics of Evelyn,
whose diary has contributed so much to English history from the reign of Charles I. to Queen
Anne. He was a great botanist, and has left a prominent and valuable work in Sylva, his treatise
on trees. It was to the north-west of Wotton, on a tract of common known as Evershed Rough,
that Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, while riding with Earl Granville in 1873, was thrown from the
saddle by his stumbling horse, and striking the ground with his head was almost immediately
killed. A cross marks the sad and lonely spot.

EPSOM AND REIGATE.

On the northern verge of the chalk-downs, and about fifteen miles south of London, is the famous
race-course at Epsom, whither much of London goes for a holiday on the "Derby Day." Epsom is
a large and rather rambling town located in a depression in the hills, and two hundred years
ago was a fashionable resort for its medicinal waters, so that it soon grew from a little village
to a gay watering-place. Its water was strongly impregnated with sulphate of magnesia, making
the Epsom salts of the druggist, and also with small quantities of the chlorides of magnesium
and calcium. None of these salts are now made at Epsom, they being manufactured artificially
in large amounts at a low price. The Epsom well, however, that produced the celebrated waters,
still remains on the common near the town. From a watering-place Epsom became transformed into
a race-ground about a hundred years ago. There is a two days' meeting in April, but the great
festival comes in May, continuing four days from Tuesday to Friday before Whitsuntide, unless
Easter is in March, when it occurs in the week after Whitsunday. Wednesday is the grand day,
when a vast crowd gathers to witness the Derby race, established in 1780 and named from the
Earl of Derby's seat at Woodmansterne, near by. This is a race of a mile and a half for three-year
olds. The Oaks Stakes are run for on Friday over the same course, but for three-year-old fillies
only. This race is named from Lambert's Oaks, near the neighboring village of Banstead. The
race-hill is elevated about five hundred feet above the sea, and the grand stand, which is
the most substantial in England, affords magnificent views, stretching far away beyond Windsor
Castle and the dome of St. Paul's in London. Epsom Downs on the Derby Day show the great annual
festival of England, but at other times the town is rather quiet, though its Spread Eagle Inn
is usually a head-quarters for the racing fraternity.

The ruins of Reigate Castle are a short distance south of Epsom, the pretty village of Reigate
standing near the head of the lovely Holmsdale on the southern verge of the chalk-ranges. Beautiful
views and an unending variation of scenery make this an attractive resort. Surrey is full of
pleasant places, disclosing quaint old houses that bring down to us the architecture of the
time of Elizabeth and the days of the "good Queen Anne." Some of these buildings, which so
thoroughly exemplify the attractions of the rural homes of England, are picturesque and noteworthy.
As specimens of many we present Pierrepoint House and Longfield, East Sheen. These are the
old models now being reproduced by modern architects, combining novelty without and comfort
within, and they are just far enough from London to make them pleasant country-houses, with
all the advantage of city luxuries.

THE WEALD OF KENT.

Proceeding eastward along the chalk-downs and over the border into Kent, we reach the Wealden
formation, the "wooded land" of that county--so named by the Saxons--which stretches between
the North and South Downs, the chalk-formations bordering this primeval forest, but now almost
entirely transformed into a rich agricultural country. The Weald is a region of great fertility
and high cultivation, still bearing numerous copses of well-grown timber, the oak being the
chief, and furnishing in times past the material for many of its substantial oaken houses.
The little streams that meander among the undulating hills of this attractive region are nearly
all gathered together to form the Medway, which flows past Maidstone to join the Thames. It
was the portions of the Weald around Goudhurst that were memorable for the exploits of Radford
and his band, the originals of G. P. R. James's Smugglers. Goudhurst church-tower, finely located
on one of the highest hills of the Wealden region, gives a grand view on all sides, especially
to the southward over Mr. Beresford Hope's seat at Bedgebury Park. In this old church of St.
Mary are buried the Bedgeburys and the Colepeppers. Their ancient house, surrounded by a moat,
has been swept away, and the present mansion was built in the seventeenth century out of the
proceeds of a sunken Spanish treasure-ship, Sir James Hayes, who built the house, having gone
into a speculation with Lord Falkland and others to recover the treasure. This origin of Bedgebury
House is recorded on its foundation-stone: it has been greatly enlarged by successive owners,
and is surrounded by ornamental gardens and grounds, with a park of wood, lake, and heather
covering two thousand acres. In the neighboring church of Kilndown, Field-marshal Beresford,
the former owner of Bedgebury, reposes in a canopied sepulchre. Just to the eastward is Cranbrook,
the chief market-town of the Weald, the ancient sanctuary of the Anabaptists and the historical
centre of the Flemish cloth-trade, which used to be carried on by the "old gray-coats of Kent."
Their descendants still live in the old-time factories, which have been converted into handsome
modern houses. Edward III. first induced the Flemings to settle in Kent and some other parts
of England, and from his reign until the last century the broadcloth manufacture concentrated
at Cranbrook. When Queen Elizabeth once visited the town she was entertained at a manor about
a mile from Cranbrook, and walked thence into the town upon a carpet, laid down the whole way,
made of the same cloth that her loyal men of Kent wore on their backs. In Cranbrook Church
were held the fierce theological disputes of Queen Mary's reign which resulted in the imprisonment
of the Anabaptists and other dissenters by Chancellor Baker. Over the south porch is the chamber
with grated windows known as "Bloody Baker's Prison." Among the old customs surviving at Cranbrook
is that which strews the path of the newly-wedded couple as they leave the church with emblems
of the bridegroom's trade. The blacksmith walks upon scraps of iron, the shoemaker on leather
parings, the carpenter on shavings, and the butcher on sheepskins. In an adjacent glen almost
surrounded by woods are the ruins of Sissinghurst, where Chancellor Baker lived and built the
stately mansion of Saxenhurst, from which the present name of its ruins is derived. The artists
Horsley and Webster lived at Sissinghurst and Cranbrook for many years, and found there frequent
subjects of rustic study. The Sissinghurst ruins are fragmentary, excepting the grand entrance,
which is well preserved. Baker's Cross survives to mark the spot where the Anabaptists had
a skirmish with their great enemy; and the legend is that he was killed there, though history
asserts that this theological warrior died in his bed peaceably some time afterwards in London.

Near Lamberhurst, on the Surrey border and on the margin of the Teise, is the Marquis of Camden's
seat at Bayham Abbey. Its ruins include a church, a gateway, and some of the smaller buildings.
It was once highly attractive, though small, and its ruined beauty is now enhanced by the care
with which the ivy is trained over the walls and the greensward floor is smoothed. Ralph de
Dene founded this abbey about the year 1200, and after the dissolution Queen Elizabeth granted
it to Viscount Montague. It was bought in the last century by Chief-Justice Pratt, whose son,
the chancellor, became Marquis of Camden. The modern mansion is a fine one, and from it a five-mile
walk through the woods leads to Tunbridge on the Medway. Chief among the older remains of this
pleasantly-located and popular town is Tunbridge Castle, its keep having stood upon a lofty
mound above the river. This "Norman Mound," as it is called, is now capped with ruined walls,
and an arched passage leads from it to the upper story of the elaborate gate-house, still in
excellent preservation. Richard Fitzgilbert built the keep, and ruled the "League of Tunbridge,"
but his castle, after a long siege by Henry III., was taken away from his successor, who assumed
the name of Gilbert de Clare. From the De Clares the stronghold passed to the Audleys and Staffords,
and it is now held by Lord Stafford. The gate-house is a fine structure, square in form, with
round towers at each corner. The ruins are richly adorned with mouldings and other decorations,
and within is a handsome state-apartment. Tunbridge is a quiet town, standing where five of
the tributaries of the Medway come together, over which it has as many stone bridges. One of
these streams, the Tun, gives the town its name. In St. Stephen's Church, a badly mutilated
building with a fine spire, many of the De Clares are buried, and the quaint half-timbered
building of the "Chequers Inn" helps maintain the picturesque appearance of the Tunbridge High
Street. The spa of Tunbridge Wells, with its chalybeate springs and baths, is a few miles southward,
but the days of its greatest glory have passed away, though fashion to a moderate extent still
haunts its pump-room and parade. This famous watering-place stands in a contracted valley enclosed
by the three hills known as Mount Ephraim, Mount Zion, and Mount Pleasant.

To the westward of Tunbridge, and in the Medway Valley, is Penshurst, celebrated as the home
of Sir Philip Sidney--a grand, gray old house, built at many periods, begun in the fourteenth
century and not completed until a few years ago. It is a pretty English picture within a setting
of wooded hills and silver rivers, the pattern from which Sidney drew his description of "Laconia"
in Arcadia. The buildings, particularly their window-heads, are ornamented with the tracery
peculiar to Kent. The great hall, the earliest of these buildings, has a characteristic open-timber
roof, while its minstrel-gallery, fronted by a wainscot screen, is ornamented with the badge
of the Dudleys, the "bear and ragged staff." Within these halls are the family portraits of
a noble lineage.

Sir Philip Sidney was her brother, born at Penshurst in 1554. The estate came through various
owners, until, in the reign of Henry II., it was granted to Sir William Sidney, who commanded
a wing of the victorious English at Flodden. Sir Philip, we are told, would have been King
of Poland had not Queen Elizabeth interposed, "lest she should lose the jewel of her times."
Algernon Sidney, beheaded on Tower Hill, was his descendant. Penshurst is now held by Baron
de l'Isle, to whom it has descended through marriage. On the estate stands the quaint old Penshurst
Church with its ivy-covered porch. The Eden River falls into the Medway near Penshurst, and
alongside its waters is the well-known castellated residence which still survives from the
Tudor days, Hever Castle, where, it is said, Anne Boleyn was born. Sir Geoffrey Boleyn, her
great-grandfather, who was Lord Mayor of London in the reign of Henry VI., began Hever Castle,
which was completed by his grandson, Anne's father. It was at Hever that King Henry wooed her.
The house is a quadrangle, with high pitched roofs and gables and surrounded by a double moat,
and is now a farm-house. Here they show the visitor Anne Boleyn's rooms, and also the chamber
where her successor, Anne of Cleves, is said to have died, though this is doubted. King Henry,
however, seized the estate of Hever from his earlier wife's family, and granted it to his subsequently
discarded consort after he separated from her. Northward of Tunbridge, and near Sevenoaks,
is Knole, the home of the family of Hon. L. S. Sackville-West, the present British minister
at Washington. It is one of the most interesting baronial mansions in England, enclosed by
a park five miles in circumference.

Proceeding eastward towards the outskirts of the Weald, we come to Leeds Castle, once the great
central fortress of Kent. Standing in a commanding position, it held the road leading to Canterbury
and the coast, and it dates probably from the Norman Conquest. Its moat surrounds three islands,
from which, as if from the water, rise its walls and towers. This castle is now the residence
of Mr. Wykeham Martin and contains many valuable antiquities. Also near the eastern border
of the Weald is Tenterden, famous for its church-steeple, which Bishop Latimer has invested
with a good story. The bishop in a sermon said that Sir Thomas More was once sent into Kent
to learn the cause of the Goodwin Sands and the obstructions to Sandwich Haven. He summoned
various persons of experience, and among others there "came in before him an olde man with
a white head, and one that was thought to be little lesse than an hundereth yeares olde. When
Maister More saw this aged man he thought it expedient to hear him say his minde in this matter,
for being so olde a man, it was likely he knew most of any man in that presence and company.
So Maister More called this olde aged man unto him, and sayd, 'Father, tell me if ye can what
is the cause of this great arising of the sande and shelfs here about this haven, the which
stop it up that no shippes can arrive here. Ye are the oldest man that I can espie in all this
companye, so that, if any man can tell any cause of it, ye of likelihode can say most in it,
or at leastwise more than any man here assembled.'--'Yea, forsooth, good master,' quod this
olde man, 'for I am wellnigh an hundreth years olde, and no man here in this companye anything
neare unto mine age.'--'Well, then,' quod Maister More, 'how say you in this matter? What think
ye to be the cause of these shelfs and flattes that stop up Sandwich Haven?'--'Forsooth, syr,'
quoth he, 'I am an olde man; I think that Tenterton Steeple is the cause of Goodwin Sandes.
For I am an olde man, syr,' quod he, 'and I may remember the building of Tenterton Steeple,
and I may remember when there was no steeple at all there. And before that Tenterton Steeple
was a-building there was no manner of speaking of any flattes or sandes that stopped the haven;
and, therefore, I thinke that Tenterton Steeple is the cause of the destroying and decaying
of Sandwich Haven.' And even so to my purpose," says Latimer in conclusion, "is preaching of
God's worde the cause of rebellion, as Tenterton Steeple is a cause that Sandwich Haven is
decayed." Now this "olde aged man" had some excuse for his theory in the Kentish tradition,
which says that the abbot of St. Augustine, who built the steeple, used for it the stones collected
to strengthen the sea-wall of Goodwin Sands, then part of the main land. The next storm submerged
the district, of which the Goodwins are the remains, and thus the steeple caused the quicksands,
according to the Kentish theory.

ROCHESTER AND CHATHAM.

Proceeding down the Medway, it flows past the city of Rochester, the river being crowded with
vessels and crossed here by a bridge with a swinging draw. Rochester has a fine old cathedral,
rather dilapidated, and in part restored, but its chief attraction is the castle towering above
the river, its Norman keep forming a tower over seventy feet square and rising one hundred
feet high, its masonry disclosing vast strength and impressive massiveness. Cobham Hall, the
residence of Earl Darnley, is near Rochester, standing in a nobly wooded park seven miles in
circumference. Just north of Cobham Park is Gad's Hill, where Charles Dickens lived. Beyond
Rochester the powerful modern defensive work of Fort Pitt rises over Chatham to defend the
Medway entrance and that important dockyard. The town is chiefly a bustling street about two
miles long. The dockyard is one of the largest in England, and its defensive works, as yet
incomplete, will when finished make it a powerful fortress, there being several outlying batteries
and works still to complete. The Gun Wharf contains a large park of artillery, and there are
barracks for three thousand men extending along the river. There is also an extensive convict-prison
with two thousand inmates, who work upon the dock extension and at making bricks for its construction.
Chatham has several military and naval hospitals. Opposite the dockyard is Upnor Castle, used
as a powder-magazine and torpedo-school. This castle, the original defensive work of Chatham,
was bombarded by Van Tromp when he came up the Medway in Charles II.'s reign--an audacity for
which he was afterwards punished. The suburb of Brompton is completely enveloped by the forts
and buildings of the post, contains barracks and hospitals for five thousand men, and is also
the head-quarters of the Royal Engineers.

CANTERBURY.

Leaving the estuary of the Medway, still farther east in Kent, in the vale of the Stour, is
the ancient cathedral city of Canterbury, whereof Rimmer says it "is one of the most delightful
cities in England for an antiquary." Its cathedral is approached through the quaint narrow
street of Mercery Lane, where once stood the Checquers Inn that was the resort of Chaucer's
pilgrims. At the end of this lane is the principal entrance to the cathedral close--Prior Goldsmith's
Gate, commonly called Christ Church Gate, built in 1517: it was formerly surmounted by turrets,
but these have been partly taken down. The arms of Becket are carved upon the gateway, and
beyond it rise the gray towers of the venerable cathedral. On the east side of the close is
Broad Street, where part of the old city-walls are still preserved. This was the site of St.
Augustine's monastery, and Lanfranc, the first archbishop after the Conquest, rebuilt the cathedral
church, which was continued by his successor, Anselm. It was in this church that Becket was
murdered in 1170, and "in the glorious choir of Conrad" his corpse was watched by the monks
on the following night. This choir was burned down four years later, but afterwards rebuilt.
The present cathedral consists of work extending from Lanfranc's time until that of Prior Goldstone
in the fifteenth century, thus exhibiting specimens of all the schools of Gothic architecture.
Canterbury Cathedral is among the largest churches in England, being five hundred and twenty-two
feet long, and its principal entrance is by the south porch. The nave is striking, and in the
choir the eye is immediately attracted by its great length, one hundred and eighty feet--the
longest in the kingdom--and by the singular bend with which the walls at the eastern end approach
each other. The architecture is antique, and the interior produces an impression of great solemnity.
The north-western transept is known as the Transept of the Martyrdom, where Becket was slain
just after Christmas by four knights in 1170. A small square piece cut out of one of the flagstones
marks the spot, and there still remain the door leading from the cloisters by which Becket
and the knights entered the cathedral, and the part of the wall in front of which the assassinated
archbishop fell. There is an attractive window in this transept, the gift of Edward IV. The
cathedral is full of monuments, and in Trinity Chapel, behind the choir, where Becket had sung
his first mass when installed as archbishop, was the location chosen for his shrine, but it
long ago disappeared. Here is also the monument of Edward the Black Prince, with his effigy
in brass, and suspended above it his helmet, shield, sword-scabbard, and gauntlets. Henry IV.
is also buried in Canterbury, with his second wife, Joan of Navarre; Cardinal Pole is entombed
here; and in the south-western transept is the singular tomb of Langton, archbishop in the
days of Magna Charta, the stone coffin so placed that the head alone appears through the wall.
In the crypt was Becket's tomb, which remained there until 1220, and at it occurred the penance
and scourging of Henry II. The cathedral has two fine western towers, the northern one, however,
not having been finished until recently. The central tower, known as "Bell Harry," rises two
hundred and thirty-five feet, and is a magnificent example of Perpendicular Gothic. In the
close are interesting remains of St. Augustine's Monastery, including its fine entrance-gate
and guest-hall, now part of St. Augustine's College, one of the most elaborate modern structures
in Canterbury. The monastery had been a brewery, but was bought in 1844 by Mr. Beresford Hope
and devoted to its present noble object. On the hill above St. Augustine, mounted by the Longport
road, is the "mother church of England," St. Martin's, which had been a British Christian chapel
before the Saxons came into the island, and was made over to Augustine. The present building
occupies the site of the one he erected.

Close to the old city-wall is Canterbury Castle, its venerable Norman keep being now used as
the town gasworks. There are many old houses in Canterbury, and its history has been traced
back twenty-eight hundred years. It was the Roman colony of Durovernum. Among its quaint houses
is the Falstaff Inn, still a comfortable and popular hostelrie, having a sign-board supported
by iron framework projecting far over the street. Adjoining is the West Gate--the only one
remaining of the six ancient barriers of the city built by Archbishop Sudbury, who was killed
in 1381 by Wat Tyler's rebels. This gate stands on the road from London to Dover, and guards
the bridge over a little branch of the Stour; the foundations of the lofty flanking round towers
are in the river-bed. The gate-house was long used as a city prison. It was in this weird old
city that Chaucer located many of his Canterbury Tales, that give such an insight into the
customs of his time. The landlord of the Tabard Inn in Southwark, whose guests were of all
ranks, proposed a journey to Canterbury after dinner, he to adjudge the best story any of them
told on the road. Chaucer's characters were all cleverly drawn and lifelike, while his innkeeper
was a man of evidently high "social status," and, as he himself said, "wise and well taught."
The Stour flows on to the sea, whose generally low shores are not far away, with the Isle of
Thanet to the northward and London's watering-place of Ramsgate on its outer verge. Here is
Pegwell Bay, noted for its shrimps, and a short distance westward from Ramsgate is Osengal
Hill, from which there is a fine view, the summit being covered by the graves of the first
Saxon settlers of Thanet. To the northward a short distance is the sister watering-place of
Margate, near the north-eastern extremity of Thanet and ninety miles from London: its pier
is nine hundred feet long. On the extremity of Thanet, about three miles from Margate, is the
great lighthouse of the North Foreland.

THE CINQUE PORTS.

Off the mouth of the Stour and the Goodwin Sands, and thence down the coast to Dover, is the
narrowest part of the strait between England and France. This is a coast, therefore, that needed
defence from the earliest times, and the cliff-castles and earthworks still remaining show
how well it was watched. The Romans carefully fortified the entire line of cliffs from the
Goodwin Sands to Beachy Head beyond Hastings. There were nine fortresses along the coast, which
in later times were placed under control of a high official known as the "Count of the Saxon
Shore," whose duty was to protect this part of England against the piratical attacks of the
Northern sea-rovers. These fortresses commanded the chief harbors and landing-places, and they
marked the position of the famous Cinque Ports, whose fleet was the germ of the British navy.
They were not thus named until after the Norman Conquest, when John de Fiennes appeared as
the first warden. The Cinque Ports of later English history were Sandwich, Dover, Hythe, Romney,
and Hastings, each of which had its minor ports or "limbs," such as Deal, Walmer, Folkestone,
Rye, Winchelsea, and Pevensey, that paid tribute to the head port and enjoyed part of its franchises.
The duty of the Cinque Ports was to furnish fifty-seven ships whenever the king needed them,
and he supplied part of the force to man them. In return the ports were given great freedom
and privileges; their people were known as "barons," were represented in Parliament, and at
every coronation bore the canopy over the sovereign, carrying it on silver staves having small
silver bells attached. The canopy was usually afterwards presented to Becket's shrine at Canterbury,
and its bearers after the coronation dined in Westminster Hall at the king's right hand. But
the glory of these redoubtable Cinque Ports has departed. Dover is the only one remaining in
active service; Sandwich, Hythe, and Romney are no longer ports at all; while Hastings is in
little better condition. The tides have gradually filled their shallow harbors with silt. Of
the "limbs," or lesser ports, two, Winchelsea and Pevensey, are now actually inland towns,
the sea having completely retired from them. Such has also been the fate of Sandwich, which
in the time of Canute was described as the most famous harbor of England. The coast has greatly
changed, the shallow bays beyond the old shore-line, which is still visible, being raised into
green meadows. In this way the water-course that made Thanet an island has been closed.

SANDWICH.

This silting up began at a remote era, closing one port after another, and Sandwich rose upon
their decline. It is the most ancient of the Cinque Ports, and existed as a great harbor until
about the year 1500, when it too began to silt up. In a century it was quite closed, traffic
had passed away, and the town had assumed the fossilized appearance which is now chiefly remarked
about it. Sandwich lingers as it existed in the Plantagenet days, time having mouldered it
into quaint condition. Trees grow from the tops of the old walls, and also intrude upon the
deep ditch with its round towers at the angles. Large open spaces, gardens, and orchards lie
between the houses within the walls of the city. Going through the old gateway leading to the
bridge crossing the Stour, a little church is found, with its roof tinted with yellowish lichens,
and a bunch of houses below it covered with red, time-worn tiles, and the still and sleepy
river near by. This was the very gate of that busy harbor which four centuries ago was the
greatest in England and the resort of ships from all parts of the then known world. Its customs
dues yielded $100,000 annually at the small rates imposed, and the great change that has been
wrought can be imagined, as the visitor looks out over the once famous harbor to find it a
mass of green meadows with venerable trees growing here and there. Sandwich has no main street,
its winding, narrow and irregular passage-ways being left apparently to chance to seek out
their routes, while a mass of houses is crushed together within the ancient walls, with church-towers
as the only landmarks. These churches give the best testimony to the former wealth and importance
of the town, the oldest being that of St. Clement, who was the patron of the seafarers. This
church is rather large, with a central tower, while the pavement contains many memorials of
the rich Sandwich merchants in times long agone. St. Peter's Church remains only as a fragment;
its tower has fallen and destroyed the south aisle. It contains a beautiful tomb erected to
one of the former wardens of the Cinque Ports. The old code of laws of Sandwich, which still
survives, shows close pattern after the Baltic towns of the Hanseatic League. Female criminals
were drowned in the Guestling Brook, which falls into the Stour; others were buried alive in
the "thief duns" near that stream. Close by the old water-gate of Sandwich is the Barbican,
and from it a short view across the marshes discloses the ancient Roman town of Rutupiæ and
the closed-up port of Ebbsfleet, where Hengist and Horsa are said to have first landed. Here
was the oyster-ground of the Romans, who loved the bivalves as well as their successors of
to-day. Of the walls of the Roman town there still remain extensive traces, disclosing solid
masonry of great thickness, composed of layers of rough boulders encased externally with regular
courses of squared Portland stone. There are square towers at intervals along these walls,
with loopholed apartments for the sentinels. Vast numbers of Roman coins have been found in
and around this ancient city, over one hundred and forty thousand, it is said, having come
to light, belonging to the decade between 287 and 297, when Britain was an independent Roman
island. Passing southward along the coast, we skirt the natural harbor of the Downs, a haven
of refuge embracing about twenty square miles of safe anchorage, and bounded on the east by
the treacherous Goodwin Sands, where Shakespeare tells us "the carcase of many a tall ship
lies buried." It is possible at low water to visit and walk over portions of these shoals.
They are quicksands of such character that if a ship strikes upon them she will in a few days
be completely swallowed up. Modern precautions, however, have rendered them less formidable
than formerly. The great storm of 1703, that destroyed the Eddystone Lighthouse, wrecked thirteen
war-ships on the Goodwins, nearly all their crews perishing. As we look out over them from
the low shores at Deal and Walmer below Sandwich, or the chalk-cliffs of Dover beyond, a fringe
of breakers marks their line, while nearer the coast merchant-ships at anchor usually crowd
the Downs. In Walmer Castle was the official residence of the lord warden of the Cinque Ports,
an office that is soon to be abolished, and which many famous men have held. Here lived Pitt,
and here died the Duke of Wellington, closing his great career.

DOVER.

Beyond, the coast rises up from the low sandy level, and rounding the South Foreland, on which
is a fine electric lighthouse of modern construction, we come to the chalk-cliffs, on top of
which are the dark towers of Dover Castle, from whose battlements the road descends to the
town along the water's edge and in the valley of the little stream that gives the place its
name--the Dour, which the Celts called the Dwr or "water," and the Romans the Dubræ. The great
keep of Dover dates from William Rufus's reign, and is one of the many badges left in England
of the Norman Conquest. There are earthworks at Dover, however, of much earlier origin, built
for protection by the Celts and Romans, and forming part of the chain that guarded this celebrated
coast, of which Dover, being at the narrowest part of the strait, was considered the key. But
no such Norman castle rises elsewhere on these shores. "It was built by evil spirits," writes
a Bohemian traveller in the fifteenth century, "and is so strong that in no other part of Christendom
can anything be found like it." The northern turret on the keep rises four hundred and sixty-eight
feet above the sea at the base of the hill, and from it can be had a complete observation of
both the English and French coasts for many miles. Within the castle is the ancient Pharos,
or watch-tower, a Roman work. Over upon the opposite side of the harbor is Shakespeare's Cliff,

  "----whose high and bending head
  Looks fearfully on the confined deep."

There is no more impressive view in England than that from the Castle Hill of Dover, with the
green fields and white chalk headlands stretching far away on either hand fringed by the breakers,
the hills and harbors faintly seen across the strait in France, and the busy town of Dover
lying at the foot of the cliff. This is half watering-place and half port of transit to the
opposite coast. Its harbor is almost entirely artificial, and there has been much difficulty
in keeping it open. That there is any port there now at all is due mainly to Raleigh's advice,
and there is at present a well-protected harbor of refuge, with a fine pier extending nearly
a half mile into the sea, with a fort at the outer end. From the top of the hill there looks
down upon this pier the Saluting-Battery Gate of the castle, within which is kept that curious
specimen of ancient gunnery known as "Queen Elizabeth's Pocket Pistol."

Farther down the coast is the ancient "limb" of Dover, which has grown into the rival port
of Folkestone. This modern port, created to aid the necessities of travel across the Channel,
stands at the north-eastern corner of the Romney Marsh, a district that has been raised out
of the sea and is steadily increasing in front of the older coast-line, shown by a range of
hills stretching westward from Folkestone. This marsh has made the sea retreat fully three
miles from Hythe, whose name signifies "the harbor," though it is now an inland village, with
a big church dedicated to St. Leonard, the deliverer of captives, who was always much reverenced
in the Cinque Ports, their warlike sailors being frequently taken prisoner. In a crypt under
its chancel is a large collection of skulls and bones, many of them bearing weapon scars and
cuts, showing them to be relics of the wars. Beyond Hythe the Rother originally flowed into
the Channel, but a great storm in the reign of Edward I. silted up its outlet, and the river
changed its course over towards Rye, so as to avoid the Cinque port of Romney that was established
on the western edge of the marshes to which it gave the name. Romney is now simply a village
without any harbor, and of the five churches it formerly had, only the church of St. Nicholas
remains as a landmark among the fens that have grown up around it, an almost treeless plain
intersected by dykes and ditches.

RYE AND WINCHELSEA.

The unpicturesque coast is thrust out into the sea to the point at Dungeness where the lighthouse
stands a beacon in a region full of peril to the navigator; and then the coast again recedes
to the cove wherein is found the quaint old town of Rye, formerly an important "limb" of the
Cinque port of Hastings. It has about the narrowest and crookedest streets in England, and
the sea is two miles away from the line of steep and broken rock along which "Old Rye" stretches.
The ancient houses, however, have a sort of harbor, formed by the junction of the three rivers,
the Rother, Brede, and Tillingham, and thus Rye supports quite a fleet of fishing-craft. Thackeray
has completely reproduced in Denis Duval the ancient character of this place, with its smuggling
atmosphere varied with French touches given by the neighborhood of the Continent. Rye stands
on one side of a marshy lowland, and Winchelsea about three miles distant on the other side.
The original Winchelsea, we are told, was on lower ground, and, after frequent floodings, was
finally destroyed by an inundation in 1287. King Edward I. founded the new town upon the hill
above. It enjoyed a lucrative trade until the fifteenth century, when, like most of the others,
its prosperity was blighted by the sea's retiring. The harbor then became useless, the inhabitants
left, the houses gradually disappeared, and, the historian says, the more massive buildings
remaining "have a strangely spectral character, like owls seen by daylight." Three old gates
remain, including the Strand Gate, where King Edward nearly lost his life soon after the town
was built. It appears that the horse on which he was riding, frightened by a windmill, leaped
over the town-wall, and all gave up the king for dead. Luckily, however, he kept his saddle,
and the horse, after slipping some distance down the incline, was checked, and Edward rode
safely back through the gate. There is a fine church in Winchelsea--St. Thomas of Canterbury--within
which are the tombs of Gervase Alard and his grandson Stephen. They were the most noted sailors
of their time, and Gervase in 1300 was admiral of the fleet of the Cinque Ports, his grandson
Stephen appearing as admiral in 1324. These were the earliest admirals known in England, the
title, derived from the Arabic amir, having been imported from Sicily. Gervase was paid two
shillings a day. At the house in Winchelsea called the "Friars" lived the noted highwaymen
George and Joseph Weston, who during the last century plundered in all directions, and then
atoned for it by the exercise of extensive charity in that town: one of them actually became
a churchwarden.

HASTINGS AND PEVENSEY.

The cliffs come out to the edge of the sea at Winchelsea, and it is a pleasant walk along them
to Hastings, with its ruined castle, the last of the Cinque Ports. This was never as important
a port as the others, but the neighboring Sussex forests made it a convenient place for shipbuilding.
The castle ruins are the only antiques at Hastings, which has been gradually transformed into
a modern watering-place in a pretty situation. Its eastern end, however, has undergone little
transition, and is still filled with the old-fashioned black-timber houses of the fishermen.
The battle of Hastings, whereby William the Conqueror planted his standard on English soil,
was fought about seven miles inland. His ships debarked their troops all along this coast,
while St. Valéry harbor in France, from which he sailed, is visible in clear weather across
the Channel. William himself landed at Pevensey, farther westward, where there is an old fortress
of Roman origin located in the walls of the ancient British-Roman town that the heathen Saxons
had long before attacked, massacring the entire population. Pevensey still presents within
these walls the Norman castle of the Eagle Honour, named from the powerful house of Aquila
once possessing it. The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the landing of William at Pevensey, which was
a "limb" of Hastings. Its Roman name was Anderida, the walls enclosing an irregular oval, the
castle within being a pentagon, with towers at the angles. Beyond it the Sussex coast juts
out at the bold white chalk promontory of Beachy Head.

A short distance inland from Pevensey is the great Sussex cattle-market at Hailsham, where
the old Michelham Priory is used as a farm-house and its crypt as a dairy. Not far away is
Hurstmonceux Castle, a relic of the times of Henry VI., and built entirely of brick, being
probably the largest English structure of that material constructed since the Roman epoch.
Only the shell of the castle remains, an interesting and picturesque specimen of the half fortress,
half mansion of the latter days of feudalism. The main gateway on the southern front has flanking
towers over eighty feet high, surmounted by watch-turrets from which the sea is visible. The
walls are magnificently overgrown with ivy, contrasting beautifully with the red brick. Great
trunks of ivy grow up from the dining-room, and all the inner courts are carpeted with green
turf, with hazel-bushes appearing here and there among the ruined walls. A fine row of old
chestnuts stands beyond the moat, and from the towers are distant views of Beachy Head, its
white chalk-cliffs making one of the most prominent landmarks of the southern coast.

BRIGHTON.

Westward of Beachy Head is the noted watering-place of this southern coast, Brighton, the favorite
resort of the Londoners, it being but fifty-one miles south of the metropolis. This was scarcely
known as a fashionable resort until about 1780, when George IV., then the Prince of Wales,
became its patron. Taken altogether, its large size, fine buildings, excellent situation, and
elaborate decorations make Brighton probably the greatest sea-coast watering-place in Europe.
It stretches for over three miles along the Channel upon a rather low shore, though in some
places the cliffs rise considerably above the beach. Almost the entire sea-front, especially
to the eastward, is protected by a strong sea-wall of an average height of sixty feet and twenty-three
feet thick at the base. This wall cost $500,000 to build, and it supports a succession of terraces
available for promenade and roadway. In front the surf rolls in upon a rather steep pebbly
beach, upon which are the bathing-machines and boats. Along the beach, and behind the sea-wall,
Brighton has a grand drive, the Marine Parade, sixty feet wide, extending for three miles along
the shore and in front of the buildings, with broad promenades on the sea-side ornamented with
lawns and gardens, and on the other side a succession of houses of such grand construction
as to resemble rows of palaces, built of the cream-colored Portland stone. The houses of the
town extend far back on the hillsides and into the valleys, and the permanent population of
130,000 is largely augmented during the height of the season--October, November, and December.
Enormous sums have been expended upon the decoration of this great resort, and its Marine Parade,
when fashion goes there in the autumn, presents a grand scene. From this parade two great piers
extend out into the water, and are used for promenades, being, like the entire city front,
brilliantly illuminated at night. The eastern one is the Chain Pier, built in 1823 at a cost
of $150,000, and extending eleven hundred and thirty-six feet into the sea. The West Pier,
constructed about fifteen years ago, is somewhat broader, and stretches out eleven hundred
and fifteen feet. Each of the piers expands into a wide platform at the outer end, that of
the West Pier being one hundred and forty feet wide, and here bands play and there are brilliant
illuminations. Both piers are of great strength, and only four cents admission is charged to
them. Prince George built at Brighton a royal pavilion in imitation of the pagodas of the Indies,
embosomed in trees and surrounded by gardens. This was originally the royal residence, but
in 1850 the city bought it for $265,000 as a public assembly-room. The great attraction of
Brighton, however, is the aquarium, the largest in the world, opened in 1872. It is constructed
in front of the Parade, and, sunken below its level, stretches some fourteen hundred feet along
the shore, and is one hundred feet wide, being surmounted by gardens and footwalks. It is set
at this low level to facilitate the movement of the sea-water, and its design is to represent
the fishes and marine animals as nearly as possible in their native haunts and habits, to do
which, and not startle the fish, the visitors go through darkened passages, and are thus concealed
from them, all the light coming in by refraction through the water. Their actions are thus
natural, and they move about with perfect freedom, some of the tanks being of enormous size.
Here swim schools of herring, mackerel, and porpoises as they do out at sea, the octopus gyrates
his arms, and almost every fish that is known to the waters of that temperature is exhibited
in thoroughly natural action. The tanks have been prepared most elaborately. The porpoises
and larger fish have a range of at least one hundred feet, and rocks, savannahs, and everything
else they are accustomed to are reproduced. The visitors walk through vaulted passages artistically
decorated, and there is music to gladden the ear. This aquarium also shows the processes of
fish-hatching, and has greatly increased the world's stock of knowledge as to fish-habits.
The tanks hold five hundred thousand gallons of fresh and salt water.

Back of Brighton are the famous South Downs, the chalk-hills of Sussex, which stretch over
fifty miles parallel to the coast, and have a breadth of four or five miles, while they rise
to an average height of five hundred feet, their highest point being Ditchling Beacon, north
of Brighton, rising eight hundred and fifty-eight feet. They disclose picturesque scenery,
and the railways from London wind through their valleys and dart into the tunnels under their
hills, whose tops disclose the gyrating sails of an army of windmills, while over their slopes
roam the flocks of well-tended sheep that ultimately become the the much-prized South Down
mutton. The chalk-cliffs bordering the Downs slope to the sea, and in front are numerous little
towns, for the whole coast is dotted with watering-places. A few miles east of Brighton is
the port of New Haven on a much-travelled route across the Channel to Dieppe.

WISTON PARK.

To the westward of Brighton and in the South Downs is the antique village of Steyning, near
which is Rev. John Goring's home at Wiston Manor, an Elizabethan mansion of much historical
interest and commanding views of extreme beauty. This is one of the most attractive places
in the South Downs, a grand park with noble trees, herds of deer wandering over the grass,
and the great ring of trees on top of Chanctonbury Hill, planted in 1760. Charles Goring, the
father of the present owner, planted these trees in his early life, and sixty-eight years afterwards,
in 1828, he then being eighty-five years old, addressed these lines to the hill:

  "How oft around thy Ring, sweet Hill, a boy I used to play,
  And form my plans to plant thy top on some auspicious day!
  How oft among thy broken turf with what delight I trod!
  With what delight I placed those twigs beneath thy maiden sod!
  And then an almost hopeless wish would creep within my breast:
  'Oh, could I live to see thy top in all its beauty dressed!'
  That time's arrived; I've had my wish, and lived to eighty-five;
  I'll thank my God, who gave such grace, as long as e'er I live;
  Still when the morning sun in spring, whilst I enjoy my sight,
  Shall gild thy new clothed Beech and sides, I'll view thee with delight."

The house originally belonged to Earl Godwine, and has had a strange history. One of its lords
was starved to death at Windsor by King John; Llewellyn murdered another at a banquet; a third
fell from his horse and was killed. Later, it belonged to the Shirleys, one of whom married
a Persian princess; it has been held by the Gorings for a long period. This interesting old
mansion has a venerable church adjoining it, surmounted by an ivy-clad tower. Chanctonbury
Hill rises eight hundred and fourteen feet, and its ring of trees, which can be seen for many
miles, is planted on a circular mound surrounded by a trench, an ancient fortification. From
it there is a grand view over Surrey and Sussex and to the sea beyond--a view stretching from
Windsor Castle to Portsmouth, a panorama of rural beauty that cannot be excelled.

ARUNDEL CASTLE.

The little river Arun flows from the South Downs into the sea, and standing upon its banks
is Arundel Castle, which gives the title of earl to the unfortunate infant son and heir of
the Duke of Norfolk, whose blindness shows that even the greatest wealth and highest rank do
not command all things in this world. A village of two steep streets mounts up the hill from
the river-bank to the castle, which has unusual interest from its striking position and the
long line of its noble owners--the Fitzalans and Howards. The extensive ramparts surround a
ponderous keep and there are fine views in all directions. This is a favorite home of the Duke
of Norfolk, and is surrounded by an extensive park. The tombs of his ancestors are in the old
parish church of St. Nicholas, built in the fourteenth century, alongside which the duke has
recently constructed a magnificent Roman Catholic church in Decorated Gothic at a cost of $500,000.
The architect of this church was Mr. Hansom, who invented for the benefit of London the Hansom
cab. Westward of Arundel is Chichester, distinguished for its cathedral and cross, the ancient
Regnum of the Romans. The cathedral, recently restored, is peculiar from having five aisles
with a long and narrow choir. Here is buried Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel in the fourteenth
century. This cathedral has a consistory court over the southern porch, reached by a spiral
staircase, from which a sliding door opens into the Lollards' Dungeon. It has a detached campanile
or bell-tower rising on the north-western side, the only example in England of such an attachment
to a cathedral. The Chichester market-cross, standing at the intersection of four streets in
the centre of the town, is four hundred years old. In front of Chichester, but nine miles away,
the low peninsula of Selsey Bill projects into the sea and is the resort of innumerable wild-fowl.
Three miles out of town is Goodwood, where the races are held. Goodwood is the seat of the
Duke of Richmond and Gordon, who has a fine park, and a valuable picture-gallery particularly
rich in historical portraits. At Bigner, twelve miles from Chichester over the chalk-downs,
are the remains of an extensive Roman villa, the buildings and pavements having been exhumed
for a space of six hundred by three hundred and fifty feet. The Rother, a tributary of the
Arun, flows down from Midhurst, where are the ruins of Cowdray, an ancient Tudor stronghold
that was burned in 1793, its walls being now finely overgrown with ivy. Dunford House, near
Midhurst, was the estate presented to Richard Cobden by the "Anti-Corn Law League."

SELBORNE.

Crossing from Midhurst over the border into Hampshire, the village of Selborne is reached,
one of the smallest but best known places in England from the care and minuteness with which
Rev. Gilbert White has described it in his Natural History of Selborne. It is a short distance
south-east of Alton and about fifty miles south-west of London, while beyond the village the
chalk-hills rise to a height of three hundred feet, having a long hanging wood on the brow,
known as the Hanger, made up mainly of beech trees. The village is a single straggling street
three-quarters of a mile in length, in a sheltered valley and running parallel with the Hanger.
At each end of Selborne there rises a small rivulet, the one to the south becoming a branch
of the Arun and flowing into the Channel, while the other is a branch of the Wey, which falls
into the Thames. This is the pleasant little place, located in a broad parish, that Gilbert
White has made famous, writing of everything concerning it, but more especially of its natural
history and peculiarities of soil, its trees, fruits, and animal life. He was born at Selborne
in 1720, and died there in 1793, in his seventy-third year. He was the father of English natural
history, for much of what he wrote was equally applicable to other parts of the kingdom. His
modest house, now overgrown with ivy, is one of the most interesting buildings in the village,
and in it they still keep his study about as he left it, with the close-fronted bookcase protected
by brass wire-netting, to which hangs his thermometer just where he originally placed it. The
house has been little if any altered since he was carried to his last resting-place. He is
described by those who knew him as "a little thin, prim, upright man," a quiet, unassuming,
but very observing country parson, who occupied his time in watching and recording the habits
of his parishioners, quadruped as well as feathered. At the end of the garden is still kept
his sun-dial, the lawn around which is one of the softest and most perfect grass carpets in
England.

The pleasant little church over which White presided is as modest and almost as attractive
as his house. It was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and measures fifty-four by forty-seven feet,
being almost as broad as it is long, consisting of three aisles, and making no pretensions,
he says, to antiquity. It was built in Henry VII.'s reign, is perfectly plain and unadorned,
and without painted glass, carved work, sculpture, or tracery. Within it, however, are low,
squat, thick pillars supporting the roof, which he thinks are Saxon and upheld the roof of
a former church, which, falling into decay, was rebuilt on these massive props because their
strength had preserved them from the injuries of time. They support blunt Gothic arches. He
writes that he remembers when the beams of the middle aisle were hung with garlands in honor
of young women of the parish who died virgins. Within the chancel is his memorial on the wall,
and he rests in an unassuming grave in the churchyard. The belfry is a square embattled tower
forty-five feet high, built at the western end, and he tells pleasantly how the three old bells
were cast into four in 1735, and a parishioner added a fifth one at his own expense, marking
its arrival by a high festival in the village, "rendered more joyous by an order from the donor
that the treble bell should be fixed bottom upward in the ground and filled with punch, of
which all present were permitted to partake." The porch of the church to the southward is modern
and shelters a fine Gothic doorway, whose folding doors are evidently of ancient construction.
The vicarage stands alongside to the westward, an old Elizabethan house.

Among the singular things in Selborne to which White calls attention are two rocky hollow lanes,
one of which leads to Alton. These roads have, by the traffic of ages and the running of water,
been worn down through the first stratum of freestone and partly through the second, so that
they look more like water-courses than roads. In many places they have thus been sunken as
much as eighteen feet beneath the level of the fields alongside, so that torrents rush along
them in rainy weather, with miniature cascades on either hand that are frozen into icicles
in winter. These lanes, thus rugged and gloomy, affright the timid, but, gladly writes our
author, they "delight the naturalist with their various botany." The old mill at Selborne,
with its dilapidated windsails, presents a picturesque appearance, and up on the chalk-hills,
where there is a far-away view over the pleasant vale beyond, is the Wishing Stone, erected
on a little mound among the trees. All these things attracted our author's close attention,
and as his parish was over thirty miles in circumference, as may be supposed his investigations
covered a good deal of ground. His work is chiefly written in the form of a series of letters
to friends, and he occasionally digresses over the border into the neighboring parishes to
speak of their peculiarities or attractions. They all had in his day little churches, and the
parish church of Greatham, not far from Selborne, is a specimen of the antique construction
of the diminutive chapels that his ancestors handed down to their children for places of worship,
each surrounded by its setting of ancient gravestones. The History of Selborne shows how the
country parson in the olden time, whose flock was small, parish isolated, and visitors few,
amused himself; but he has left an enduring monument that grows the more valuable as the years
advance. In fact, it is a text-book of natural history; and so complete have been his observations
that he not only describes all the plants and animals, birds, rocks, soils, and buildings,
but he also has space to devote to the cats of Selborne, and to tell how they prowl in the
roadway and mount the tiled roofs to capture the chimney swallows. How he loved his home is
shown in the poem with which his work begins. We quote the opening stanza, and also some other
characteristic portions of this ode, which describes the attractions of Selborne in the last
century:

  "See Selborne spreads her boldest beauties round,
  The varied valley, and the mountain ground
  Wildly majestic: what is all the pride
  Of flats with loads of ornament supplied?
  Unpleasing, tasteless, impotent expense,
  Compared with Nature's rude magnificence.

WINCHESTER.

About sixteen miles south-west of Selborne is the chief city of Hampshire and one of the great
historical cities of the realm--Winchester--built on the side of a chalk-hill rising from the
valley of the Itchen, a stream that was Izaak Walton's favorite fishing-ground. This was the
Roman Venta Belgarum, and was made an episcopal see in the seventh century. Nothing remains
of the earlier cathedral, which was replaced by the present structure, begun in the eleventh
century, but not finished until the fifteenth. Winchester Cathedral is five hundred and sixty
feet long, and its nave is in the highest degree impressive, being the longest in England,
extending two hundred and sixty-five feet. The western front has recently been restored. Within
the cathedral are many noted tombs, including that of William Rufus, and above the altar is
West's painting of the "Raising of Lazarus." In the presbytery are six mortuary chests containing
the remains of kings and bishops of the ancient Saxon kingdom of Wessex. St. Swithin's shrine
was the treasure of Winchester: he was bishop in the ninth century and the especial patron
of the city and cathedral. Originally interred in the churchyard, his remains were removed
to the golden shrine given by King Edgar, though tradition says this was delayed by forty days
of rain, which is the foundation of the popular belief in the continuance of wet weather after
St. Swithin's Day, July 15. In the Lady Chapel, Queen Mary was married to Philip of Spain in
1554, and the chair on which she sat is still preserved there. The cathedral close is extremely
picturesque, surrounded by houses of considerable antiquity. Among the prelates of Winchester
were William of Wykeham and Cardinal Beaufort: the former founded St. Mary's College there
in the fourteenth century--a fine structure, with the picturesque ruins of the old palace of
the bishops, Wolvesey Castle, near by; the latter, in the fifteenth century, built Cardinal
Beaufort's Tower and Gateway in the southern suburbs, on the Southampton road, when he revived
the foundation of St. Cross. This noble gateway, when approached from the city, is seen through
the foliage, with a background of quaint high chimneys, church, and green leaves. The river
Itchen flows alongside the road, half hidden among the trees. The St. Cross Hospital, with
the thirteen brethren still living there in their black gowns and silver crosses, gives a vivid
picture of ancient England. Adjoining the gateway on the left hand is the brewery, formerly
known as the "Hundred Men's Hall," because a hundred of the poorest men in Winchester were
daily entertained there at dinner, and, as the repast was provided on a bountiful scale, the
guests always had ample provisions to carry home to their families. The tower and surrounding
buildings are excellent examples of the domestic architecture of the fifteenth century. In
this hospital the custom still prevails of giving the wayfarer a horn of ale and dole of bread,
the ale being brewed on the premises and of the same kind made there centuries ago. The old
West Gate of Winchester, the only survivor of the city's four gates, is a well-preserved specimen
of the military architecture of the time of Henry III. Winchester Castle was originally built
by William the Norman, and continued a residence of the kings until Henry III., but of it little
remains beyond the hall and some subterranean fragments. Here hangs on the wall what is said
to be the top of King Arthur's round table. There is a beautiful cross in Winchester, recently
restored, and originally erected on the High Street by Cardinal Beaufort, who seems to have
spent much of his vast and ill-gotten wealth in splendid architectural works. Shakespeare introduces
him in Henry VI., and in the scene that closes his career truthfully depicts him:

  "If thou be'st death, I'll give thee England's treasure,
  Enough to purchase such another island.
  So thou wilt let me live and feel no pain."

THE NEW FOREST.

The Itchen flows into the estuary of Southampton Water, and from its western shores spreads
far away the domain of the New Forest, stretching down into the south-western part of Hampshire.
This is a remnant of the forests that once covered the greater part of the island, and is the
most extensive left in the English lowlands. It was made a royal forest by William the Norman,
and thus continues to the present time, the largest tract of uncultivated land and one of the
finest examples of woodland scenery in the kingdom. It covers almost the whole surface between
Southampton Water and the Avon, which is the western border of Hampshire, but in recent years
its area has been gradually curtailed, though its extent has never been accurately measured.
Stretching about fifteen miles from east to west and twenty miles from north-west to south-east,
it includes about ninety-one thousand acres, of which twenty-six thousand belong to private
landowners, two thousand are the absolute property of the Crown, and the remaining sixty-three
thousand acres have common and other rights due to a large number of tenants, though the title
is in the Crown. About twenty-five thousand acres are covered with timber, but only five thousand
acres of this is old timber, the remainder having been planted with trees within the last two
hundred years. The surface is gently undulating, becoming hilly in the northern parts; the
soil is usually arid, and the scenery discloses wide expanses of heathery moor, often marshy
in the lower grounds, with here and there copses that gradually thicken into woodland as the
true forest district is approached. The chief trees are oak and beech, which attain to noble
proportions, while there are occasional tufts of holly and undergrowth.

Almost in the centre of the forest is the village of Lyndhurst, regarded as the best point
of departure for its survey--a hamlet with one long street and houses dotted about on the flanks
of a hill, the summit of which is adorned by a newly-built church of red brick with bath-stone
dressings. Within this church is Sir Frederick Leighton's fresco of the "Wise and Foolish Virgins."
In the ponderous "Queen's House," near the church, lives the chief official of the forest,
and here are held the courts. Formerly, this official was always a prince royal and known as
the lord warden, but now his powers are vested in the "First Commissioner of Woods and Forests:"
here the poacher was in former days severely punished. The New Forest was originally not only
a place for the king's pleasure in the chase, but it also furnished timber for the royal navy,
though this fell into disuse in the Civil War. Subsequently parts were replanted, and William
III. planted by degrees six thousand acres with trees. The great storm of 1703 uprooted four
thousand fine trees, and then again there was partial neglect, and it was not until within
a half century that a serious effort was made to fully restore the timber. There have now been
ten thousand acres planted: a nursery for young trees has been established, and about seven
hundred acres are annually planted, the young oaks being set out between Scotch firs, whose
more rapid growth protects the saplings from the gales, and when they are able to stand alone
the firs are thinned out. About four miles north of Lyndhurst and beyond Minstead is Rufus's
Stone. Around Minstead Manor the land has long been enclosed and cultivated, and looks as little
like a wild forest as can be imagined, while northward the ground rises to the top of Stony
Cross Hill, disclosing one of the finest views in this region, looking down over a wide valley,
with cultivated fields on its opposite sides and woodland beyond, gently shelving to Southampton
Water, of which occasional glimpses may be had. There is an abundance of woodland everywhere,
checquered by green lawns. At our back is the enclosed park, within which some intrenchments
mark the site of Castle Malwood, where tradition says that William Rufus passed the night previous
to his death. The king just before dawn aroused his attendants by a sudden outcry, and rushing
into the chamber they found him in such agitation that they remained there until morning. He
had dreamed he was being bled, and that the stream from his veins was so copious that it rose
to the sky, obscuring the sun. The daylight also brought other omens: a foreign monk at the
court had been dreaming, and saw the king enter a church, seize the rood, and rend it with
his teeth; the holy image at first submitted to the insult, then struck down the king, who,
while prostrate, vomited fire and smoke which masked the stars. The king, whose courage had
returned with daylight, made light of the monk's tale, though he did not go to hunt as usual
that morning, but after dinner, having taken liberal drafts of wine, rode out with a small
party, including Walter Tyril, lord of Pontoise, lately arrived from Normandy. They hunted
throughout the afternoon, and near sunset the king and Tyril found themselves alone in a glade
below the castle. A stag bounded by, and the king unsuccessfully shot at him; then another
ran past, when Tyril shot his arrow, bidden, as tradition says, by the king "in the devil's
name." The arrow struck William Rufus full in the chest, and he dropped lifeless. Tyril, putting
spurs to his horse, galloped westward to a ford across the Avon into Dorsetshire. Soon after
a charcoal-burner named Purkis, whose descendants still live in the New Forest, came past,
found the king's body, and, placing it on his cart, bore it, still bleeding, to Winchester.
Tyril's arrow had glanced from a tree, which long existed, but, decaying centuries afterward,
Rufus's Stone was set up to mark the spot. This became mutilated, and has been enclosed in
an iron casing, with copies of the original inscriptions on the outside. It is now a cast-iron
pillar about five feet high, with a grating at the top, through which may be seen the stone
within. It stands on a gentle slope, not quite at the bottom of the valley, with pretty scenery
around. Tyril got his horse shod at the Avon ford, for which offence the blacksmith afterwards
paid an annual fine to the Crown. He was not very hotly pursued, however, and made his escape
into Normandy, where he sturdily denied that the arrow was shot by him at all, laying the blame
to a conspiracy of the king's enemies, of whom he had many.

Southward from Lyndhurst the road goes over undulating ground and through magnificent oaks
and beeches to Brockenhurst, past a heronry at Vinney Ridge. This section contains some of
the finest trees in the forest, with plenty of dense holly and an occasional yew. The ground
discloses the bracken fern, and gray lichen clings thickly to the trunks and branches of the
trees. The woodland views along this road are splendid, and only need the wild animals of a
former era to bring back the forest-life of mediæval times. Off to the eastward, standing on
the little river Exe, are the foliage-clad ruins of Beaulieu Abbey, founded by King John, and
now held by the Duke of Buccleuch, who has a mansion near by. Here was buried John's mother,
Eleanor of Aquitaine, and here came the widow of Warwick the King-maker, after the battle of
Barnet, for sanctuary. Perkin Warbeck when defeated also took refuge at Beaulieu, where he
surrendered on promise of mercy. The abbey is a wreck now, for after its dissolution we are
told that its stones "went to build Henry VIII.'s martello tower at Hurst, and its lead to
repair Calshot" on Southampton Water, while the gate-house serves as the entrance to the modern
ducal mansion, and the refectory is the parish church. Here are the tombs of Mary Dore and
Mary Do. The former was a noted witch, "who could transform herself into a hare or cat, and
afflict or cure all the cattle in the neighborhood." The latter is credited with more celestial
attributes in the obituary that survives her than were allotted her unfortunate companion;
and the acrostic inscription on her tomb is often quoted:

  "Merciless fate (to our greate griefe and woe)
  A prey hath here made of our deere Moll Do,
  Rapte up in duste and hid in earthe and claye,
  Yet live her soule and virtues now and aye;
  Death is a debt all owe which must be paide
  Oh that she knew, and of it was not afraide!"

To the westward of Beaulieu is Brockenhurst, a pretty forest village, along whose main street
we are told the deer formerly galloped on a winter's night, to the great excitement of all
the dogs therein. The forest almost blends with the village-green, and on a low artificial
mound stands its church, with traces of almost every style of architecture since the Conquest,
and guarded by a famous yew and oak. At Boldre, near Brockenhurst, lived Rev. W. Gilpin, the
vicar of the parish, the author of several works on sylvan scenery, and reputed to be the original
of the noted Dr. Syntax, who made such a humorous "Tour in Search of the Picturesque." He now
lies at rest under a maple alongside his church, in which Southey was married. Ringwood is
the chief town of the western forest-border upon the level plain that forms the Avon Valley
where Tyril escaped across the ford. It is not a very interesting place. A little way up the
river, near Horton, "King Monmouth" was captured after Sedgemoor, and from Ringwood he wrote
the abject letters begging his life from King James, who turned a deaf ear to all entreaty.
Alice Lisle, who was judicially murdered by Judge Jeffreys for sheltering two refugees from
that battle, also lived at Moyle Court, near Ringwood. The chief inn is the "White Hart," named
in memory of Henry VII.'s hunt in the New Forest, where the game, a white hart, showed fine
running throughout the day, and ultimately stood at bay in a meadow near the village, when,
at the intercession of the ladies, the hounds were called off, the hart secured, given a gold
collar, and taken to Windsor. The inn where the king partook of refreshments that day had its
sign changed to the White Hart. It was at Bisterne, below Ringwood, that Madonie of Berkeley
Castle slew the dragon, for which feat King Edward IV. knighted him--a tale that the incredulous
will find confirmed by the deed still preserved in Berkeley Castle which records the event,
confers the knighthood, and gives him permission to wear the dragon as his badge.

CHRISTCHURCH.

From Brockenhurst the Lymington River flows southward out of the New Forest into the Solent,
across which is the Isle of Wight, steamers connecting Lymington at the mouth of the river
with Yarmouth on the island. About twelve miles westward from Lymington is Christchurch, at
the confluence of the Avon and Stour Rivers, which here form the estuary known as Christchurch
Bay. The Avon flows down past Ringwood on the western verge of the New Forest, its lower valley
being a wide grassy trough in a rolling plateau of slight elevation. The moors, with many parts
too arid for cultivation, extend to the sea, having glens here and there whose sandy slopes
are often thickly wooded, and whose beds are traversed by the "bournes" that give names to
so many localities in this region. Along all the sea-border fashionable watering-places are
springing up, which enjoy views over the water to the distant chalk-downs of the Isle of Wight,
one of the best being that from Boscombe Chine. Through this land the Avon flows, and the Stour
enters it from the west, with the ancient town of Christchurch standing on the broad angle
between them. It is of Roman origin, and the remains of a British castle crown the neighboring
promontory of Hengistbury Head. The chief attraction is the magnificent Priory Church, founded
before the Norman Conquest, but rebuilt afterwards and dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The ancient
town was known as Twynham from the two rivers, and it then became Christchurch-at-Twynham,
but the original name was ultimately dropped. It was a royal demesne in Edward I.'s reign,
and Edward III. granted it to the Earl of Salisbury, whose countess was the heroine of the
institution of the Order of the Garter. It is a sleepy, old-fashioned place, with little of
interest excepting the Priory Church and the castle. The square church-tower rises high above
the Avon, a landmark from afar, its mass of gray masonry catching the eye from away over the
sea. The church is of large dimensions, cruciform in plan, with short transepts, and a Lady
chapel having the unusual peculiarity of an upper story. It is about three hundred and ten
feet long, with the tower at the western end, and a large northern porch. The oldest part of
the church was built in the twelfth century by Flambard, Bishop of Durham, who was granted
this priory by William Rufus. Subsequently, he fell into disfavor, and the priory became a
college of the Augustinians. Only the nave and transepts are left of his Norman church, the
remainder being of later construction. The north porch, which has an extremely rich Decorated
doorway, is of unusual size, having an upper chamber, and dating from the thirteenth century.
The nave is of great beauty, being separated from the aisles by massive semicircular arches,
rich in general effect, with a triforium above consisting of a double arcade, making it worthy
to compete with the finest naves in England. The clerestory is more modern, being of Pointed
Gothic, and the aisles are also of later construction: the northern aisle contains a beam to
which is attached the legend that the timber was drawn out as if an elastic material "by the
touch of a strange workman who wrought without wages and never spoke a word with his fellows."
The western tower is of Perpendicular architecture, added by the later builders, and beneath
it is the handsome marble monument erected to the memory of the poet Shelley, drowned at Spezzia
in 1822: his family lived near Christchurch. The tower contains a peal of eight bells, two
of them ancient, and from the belfry there is a noble view over the valleys of the two rivers,
the distant moorlands and woods of the New Forest, the estuary winding seaward and glittering
in the sun, while beneath are the houses and gardens of the town spread out as on a map. Among
the many monuments in the church is that to Margaret, Countess of Salisbury, the last of the
line who possessed the priory, and the closing heiress of the race of Plantagenets. She was
the mother of Cardinal Pole, who upheld the cause of the pope against Henry VIII., and she
was a prisoner in the Tower, held as hostage for his good behavior. At seventy years of age
she was ordered out for execution, but refused to lay her head upon the block, saying, "So
should traitors do, and I am none." Then, the historian says, "turning her gray head in every
way, she bade the executioner, if he would have her head, to get it as he could, so that he
was constrained to fetch it off slovenly." She was beheaded in May, 1541, being too near in
kinship to the throne to be allowed to live. Little is left of the ancient priory buildings
beyond the ruins of the old Norman gateway. The castle of Christchurch has also almost disappeared,
leaving only massive fragments of the wall of the keep crowning a mound. It was of slight historical
importance; and a more perfect relic is the ruin of the ancient Norman house standing near
by on the bank of the Stour, an ivy-clad shell of masonry still showing the staircase and interior
apartments. This crumbling memorial of the twelfth century was the home of Baldwin de Redvers,
then Earl of Devon.

SOUTHAMPTON.

Crossing over the New Forest back to the Southampton Water on its eastern border, the river
Itchen debouches on the farther shore near the head of the estuary, making a peninsula; and
here is the celebrated port of Southampton, located between the river Itchen and the river
Test, and having an excellent harbor. The Southampton Water extends from the Red Bridge, a
short distance above the city, to Calshot Castle, about seven miles below, and varies in breadth
from a mile and a half to two miles, the entrance being well protected by the Isle of Wight,
which gives the harbor the peculiarity of four tides in the twenty-four hours--double the usual
number, owing to the island intercepting a portion of the tidal wave in its flow both ways
along the Channel. Southampton comes down from the Romans, and remains of their camp, Clausentum,
now known as Bittern Manor, are still to be seen in the suburbs, while parts of the Saxon walls
and two of the old gates of the town are yet preserved. The Danes sacked it in the tenth century,
and afterwards it was the occasional residence of Canute, its shore being said to be the scene
of his rebuke to his courtiers when he commanded the tide to cease advancing and it disobeyed.
Southampton was destroyed by foreign invaders in the fourteenth century, and rebuilt by Richard
II. and strongly fortified. For many years it was a watering-place, but within half a century
extensive docks have been built, and it has become a great seaport, being the point of departure
for steamship-lines to all parts of the world, especially the East Indies and America, as it
is but seventy miles south-west of London, and thus shortens the sea voyage for trade from
the metropolis. The harbor is a fine one, the channel being deep and straight, and affording
good anchorage. In exploring the antiquities of Southampton the visitor will be attracted by
an ancient house of the Plantagenet period located on St. Michael's Square, said to have been
occupied by Henry VIII. and Anne Boleyn, and the remains of the town-walls. The old Bargate
in these walls crosses the High Street, dividing it into "Above Bar" and "Below Bar." In the
ancient walls are the antique towers known as Arundel Tower and Catch-Cold Tower, and also
a house (one of the oldest in England) built anterior to the twelfth century, and known as
King John's Palace. Southampton Park, called the Common, is a pretty enclosure of three hundred
and sixty acres just north of the city. The picturesque ruins of Netley Abbey are about three
miles south of the city, and near them is the Royal Victoria Hospital, established just after
the Crimean War, both of them on the eastern bank of Southampton Water.

PORTSMOUTH.

We will follow Southampton Water down to its entrance, where the two broad channels dividing
the Isle of Wight from the mainland--the Solent and Spithead--join, and at the point jutting
out on the western angle pass Calshot Castle, founded for coast-defence by Henry VIII., and
now occupied by the coast-guard. Skirting along Spithead, which is a prolongation of the Southampton
Water, without change of direction, at about twenty miles from Southampton we round Gillkicker
Point, forming the western boundary of Portsmouth harbor. Here is Gosport, and east of it is
Portsea Island, about four miles long and two and a half miles broad, on which Portsmouth is
located, with its suburbs known as Portsea, Landport, and Southsea. Portsmouth is on the south-western
part of the island, separated from Portsea by a small stream to the northward, both being united
in a formidable fortress whose works would require thirteen thousand men to man, though the
ordinary garrison is about twenty-five hundred. The royal dockyard, covering one hundred and
twenty acres, is at Portsea, and at Gosport, opposite, are the storehouses, the channel between
them, which extends for several miles between Portsea Island and the mainland, gradually widening
until it attains three miles' breadth at its northern extremity. This channel affords anchorage
for the largest vessels, and is defended by Southsea Castle on the eastern side and Moncton
Fort on the western side of the entrance into Spithead, where the roadstead is sheltered by
the Isle of Wight. Portsmouth was a port in the days of the Saxons, who in the sixth century
called it Portsmuthe. It fitted out a fleet of nine ships to aid King Alfred defeat the Danes,
and its vessels ineffectually endeavored to intercept the Normans when they landed near Hastings.
In the fourteenth century the French burned the town, but were afterwards defeated with heavy
loss. Ever since then the fortifications have been gradually improved, until now it is one
of the strongest British fortresses. The Duke of Buckingham was murdered here in 1628, and
part of the house where he was killed still remains. In 1757, Admiral Byng was executed here,
and in 1782 the ship "Royal George" was sunk with Admiral Kempenfelt and "twice four hundred
men." The town of Portsmouth contains little that is attractive beyond its ancient church of
St. Thomas à Becket, built in the reign of Henry II., and containing on its register the record
of the marriage of Charles II. with Catharine of Braganza in 1662. This marriage took place
in the garrison chapel, which was originally the hospital of St. Nicholas, founded in the time
of Henry III. The chief place of interest is the dockyard at Portsea, the entrance to which,
by the Common Hard, or terrace fronting the harbor, bears the date of 1711. Here they have
many relics of famous ships, and also vast numbers of boats, and all kinds of materials for
building war-vessels, especially iron and armor-plated ships, with the docks and slips for
their construction. Off the dockyard lies at anchor the most famous of the "wooden walls of
old England," the "Victory," the ship in which Nelson died at Trafalgar, then the most powerful
vessel of the British navy. Near her is anchored another celebrated man-of-war, the port-admiral's
flag-ship, the "Duke of Wellington." The stores across the harbor at Gosport are on a large
scale, and are known as the Royal Clarence Victualling Yard. In the southern part of Gosport
is the Haslar Hospital for sick and disabled sailors and soldiers. From Gillkicker Point beyond,
a sandbank stretches about three miles out from the shore in a south-easterly direction, and
is called the Spit. This gives the name to the roadstead of Spithead, west of which is the
quarantine station of Motherbank. This is the great roadstead of the British navy, and in the
miles of docks, sheds, forges, basins, and shops of Portsmouth harbor that weary the tourist,
who thinks he ought to dutifully go through them, are fashioned many of the monster iron-clads
that modern improvements have made necessary in naval architecture.

THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

Crossing over the narrow strait--for there is ample opportunity by several routes--we will
complete this English tour by a journey beyond the Solent and Spithead to the Isle of Wight.
This island, formed like an irregular lozenge about twenty-two miles long and thirteen broad,
is rich in scientific and historical associations, and a marvel of climate and scenery. Its
name of Wight is said to preserve the British word "gwyth," the original name having been "Ynys-gwyth,"
or the "Channel Island." The Roman name was "Vectis," Rome having conquered it in Claudius'
time. The English descended upon it in the early part of the sixth century, and captured its
chief stronghold, Whitgarasbyrg, now Carisbrooke Castle. It afterwards became part of the Saxon
kingdom of Wessex, and St. Wilfrid, Archbishop of York, is said to have converted its people
to Christianity. Then the Danes devastated it, and after the Norman Conquest it was subdued
by Fitzosborne, Earl of Hereford, whose descendants ruled it until Edward I. recovered the
wardenship for the Crown. Richard II. granted it to the Earl of Salisbury, and Henry VI. created
the Earl of Warwick, Henry Beauchamp, "king of the Isle of Wight," crowning him with his own
hands. The title reverted to the Crown in the time of Henry VII. The French several times invaded
the island, and it was the intention of the leaders of the Spanish Armada to capture and use
it as a base for operations against England, but the English fleet harassed them so badly that
they had to sail past without effecting a landing. In the Civil War the Isle of Wight made
a considerable figure.

Beginning at the western end of the lozenge-shaped island, beyond which are the Needles, the
entrance to the Solent is found defended by successive batteries on every headland, with Hurst
Castle on the Hampshire shore. High Down, with its fine chalk-cliffs, rises six hundred feet
above the sea, being haunted by numerous sea-gulls, and under it is Scratchell's Cave, a singular
recess in the rock accessible only by boat. Sheltered by the bold headland is Alum Bay, with
its tinted sands, gray, buff, and red, and from Headon Hill, its eastern boundary, the coast
stretches away to Yarmouth, a little town on the Solent, where are the remains of one of the
defensive blockhouses built by Henry VIII. The shores of the strait trend to the north-east,
with pleasant views across on the coast of Hampshire, until the northernmost point of the Isle
of Wight is reached, where its chief stream, the Medina, flows into the strait through an estuary
about five hundred yards wide. Here is Cowes, divided by the river into the West Cow and the
East Cow, the plural form of the name being modern. It is a popular bathing-place, but gets
the most fame from being the headquarters of the Royal Yacht Club; their house is the old castle
at the Medina entrance, built by Henry VIII., it is said, with portions of the masonry of Beaulieu
Abbey. The harbor, at the proper season, is usually dotted with yachts. There is steam communication
with the mainland, and a railway runs inland to Newport, the chief town of the island. Near
East Cowes is Whippingham, which was the birthplace of Dr. Arnold, the famous head-master of
Rugby School. Ascending the Medina, the beautiful park and gardens of Osborne House, the marine
residence of Queen Victoria, border its eastern margin. This was the ancient manor of Austerbourne,
and its owner in the Civil War buried all his money and plate in an adjoining wood, called
the Money Copse, so as to preserve it. When peaceful days came back he went to get it, but
found he had concealed it so thoroughly that it could not be recovered. The queen bought the
estate in 1844, and the plain mansion was extended into an elegant marine villa just back from
the sea-coast. It was the queen's childhood attachment to the locality that made her settle
here, for when a young princess she had passed many pleasant days in the neighboring Norris Castle.

East of the Medina the coast trends to the south-east, the shores being lined by fine villas
surrounded with highly-cultivated grounds; indeed, the coast of the strait seems like an extended
park. Here, opposite Portsmouth, is the famous watering-place of Ryde, in a beautiful situation,
and with railways running across the island to Sandown and Ventnor. The land steeply rises
from the sea, with the town stretching along its slope, a panorama of villas whose trees grow
down to the water's edge. It is an ancient town, having existed in the reign of Richard II.,
when the French burned it, but none of the present buildings are of much antiquity, it having
in later years been gradually converted into a fashionable watering-place. The pier is the
popular promenade, and the Spithead roadstead in front is closely connected with English naval
history. It was here that the "Royal George" went down on a calm day and drowned her admiral
and eight hundred men: she was careened over, the better to make some repairs, and, a squall
striking her, it is said the heavy guns slid down to the lower side and tipped the vessel over,
when she quickly filled and sank. Here also, in 1797, was the great mutiny in Lord Bridport's
fleet, the sailors, when the signal to weigh anchor was given, declining to do it until their
just demands were granted; the mutiny was suppressed and the leaders severely punished. All
the neighboring shores bristle with forts and batteries protecting the entrance to Spithead.
Inland are the Binstead quarries, whose stone was in demand in the Middle Ages and built parts
of Winchester Cathedral, Beaulieu Abbey, and Christchurch; also, here are the scanty remains
of Quarr Abbey. Eastward of Ryde the coast is low and bends more to the southward, reaching
the estuary known as Brading Harbor, a broad sheet of water at full tide, but a dismal expanse
of mud at low water, through which a small stream meanders. At Brading is the old Norman church
which St. Wilfrid founded, of which Rev. Legh Richmond, author of the Annals of the Poor, was
the curate. In the churchyard is the grave of his heroine, little Jane, the "Dairyman's Daughter."
Extensive remains of a Roman villa have been discovered at Morton, near Brading, and to the
eastward of them a hyptocaust. Rounding the Foreland, which is the easternmost point of the
island, the chalk-rocks rise again, and Whitecliff Bay nestles under the protection of the
lofty Culver Cliff as the coastline bends south-west and then makes a grand semicircular sweep
to the southward around Sandown Bay. This wide expanse broadens between the two chalk-ridges
that cross the Isle of Wight from its western side. The railway from Ryde runs across the chalk-downs
to the growing watering place of Sandown, standing on the lowest part of the shores of the
bay. Here the coast is guarded by a grim fort, and here in the last century came the noted
John Wilkes to recuperate after his contests with the House of Commons, which vainly tried
to keep him out of his seat.

The chalk-ranges to the southward provide magnificent scenery, and two miles from Sandown,
but on higher ground, is Shanklin, from which its celebrated chine descends to the sea. This
little ravine is about four hundred and fifty yards long and at its mouth about two hundred
feet deep. It has been gradually worn in the brown sandstone rock by the action of a diminutive
brook that bubbles over a little cascade at the upper end. The rich colors of the crags, the
luxuriant foliage of the slopes, and the rhapsodies of guide books combine to give the Shanklin
Chine a world-wide fame. It was here that a party of French under the Chevalier d'Eulx landed
in 1545 to get some fresh water. The process was tedious, the stream being so small, and the
chevalier and some of his party, wandering inland, were caught in an ambuscade. He and most
of the others were killed, though they defended themselves bravely. South of Shanklin the chalk-cliffs
are bold and lofty, and off these pretty shores the "Eurydice" was lost in a squall, March
24, 1878, when returning from her training-cruise in the West Indies. It was at four o'clock
on Sunday afternoon, and her ports being open when the squall struck her, she capsized and
almost immediately foundered, only two survivors remaining out of the three hundred persons
on board. Climbing the cliffs south of Shanklin and crossing the summit, we reach Bonchurch
on the southern coast, described by Dr. Arnold as the most beautiful thing on the sea-coast
north of Genoa. Here villas are dotted and the villages are spreading into towns, for the coast
of the Undercliff is becoming one of the most fashionable resorts the English have. Already
complaints are made that a too general extension of settlements is interfering with the picturesque
wildness of scenery and luxuriant vegetation that are the great charm of this delightful region.
The Undercliff stretches along the southern coast for several miles to the westward of Bonchurch--an
irregular terrace formed by the sliding forward of the chalk-downs, which dip gently towards
the sea. This makes a lofty natural terrace, backed by cliffs to the northward and open to
the full influence of the southern sun. It has the climate of Madeira, and is fanned by the
sea-breezes that invigorate but do not chill. The mildness of the winter makes it a popular
resort for invalids, and many greenhouse plants live outdoors throughout the year, the almost
perpendicular rocks of the Undercliff absorbing during the day the heat that they radiate throughout
the night. Yet at Bonchurch many who had sought health in this beautiful region ultimately
found a grave, and of its churchyard it has been written, "It might make one in love with death
to think one would be buried in so sweet a place." The ancient little Norman church of St.
Boniface is still here, but a new and larger church was built not long ago. Here lies Rev.
W. Adams, who wrote the allegory Under the Shadow of the Cross, and it is strictly true, for
the cross raised as his monument casts its shadow on the slab over his grave. Admiral Hobson
was born at Bonchurch, and ran away from the tailor's shop in which he was apprenticed to come
back knighted for his victory over the Spaniards at Vigo Bay. Ventnor, known as the "metropolis
of the Undercliff," is beyond Bonchurch, and is also a thriving wateringplace, above which
rises the attractive spire of Holy Trinity Church, built by the munificence of three sisters.

From Ventnor the most beautiful part of the island coast stretches westward to Niton. The bold
chalk-downs rise from their craggy bases, the guardians of the broken terrace intervening between
them and the sea. Foliage and ivy cling to them; flowers cluster on the turf and banks and
gleam in the crevices; and little streams come down the ravines. Here was the smallest church
of England--St. Lawrence--twenty feet long, twelve wide, and six feet high to the eaves. A
chancel has lately been added, while below are the ivy-clad ruins of the ancient Woolverton
Chapel. Near Niton, at Puckaster Cove, Charles II. landed after a terrific storm; and beyond
is Roche End, the southern point of the island. The coast, a dangerous one, then trends to
the north-west, and wrecks there are frequent, while inland St. Catharine's Down rises steeply,
there being a magnificent view of the island from its summit, elevated seven hundred and fifty
feet. Here in the fourteenth century was founded, on the highest part of the Isle of Wight,
a chantry chapel where a priest prayed for the mariner and at night kept a beacon burning to
warn him off the reefs. An octagonal tower of the chapel remains, but a lighthouse supersedes
the pious labors of the priest; a column near by commemorates a visit of the Russian Czar to
the summit of the hill in 1814. The wild scenery of this region is varied by the great landslip
which in 1799 carried about one hundred acres down towards the sea, the marks of its progress
being still shown in the rended rocks and wave-like undulations of the earth. About a mile
to the westward is the most noted and wildest of the ravines of the island, the Blackgang Chine,
now filled with paths and summer-houses, for the thrifty hotel-keepers could not help domesticating
such a prize. It is a more open ravine than that at Shanklin, and like it cut out by a tiny
stream, while far away through the entrance is a distant view westward to Portland Isle and
St. Aldhelm's Head. The rocks are dark green, streaked with gray and brown sandstone, looking
like uncouth courses of masonry. The adjoining coast is guarded by grim crags on which many
ships have been shattered. There are other chines to the westward--all of great attractions,
though of less size and celebrity. The coast is not of so much interest beyond, but the cliffs,
which are the outposts of the chalk-measures, become more lofty at Freshwater Gate, and our
survey of the island shores terminates at the Main Bench, whose prolonged point goes out to
the Needles.

CARISBROOKE CASTLE.

Following up the Medina River a few miles, almost to the centre of the island, it leads to
the metropolis, the little town of Newport, and here, upon an outer precipice of the chalk-downs
overlooking the river-valley and the town, and elevated two hundred feet above the sea, is
Carisbrooke Castle. The oldest part of the present remains come down from Fitzosborne, but
additions were afterwards made, and Queen Elizabeth, in anticipation of the descent of the
Armada, had an outer line of defence constructed, pentagonal in shape and enclosing considerable
space. The loyalty of the people in that time of trial was shown by their subscribing money
and laboring without pay on these works. The ruins are not striking, but are finely situated
on the elevated ridge. They are much decayed, but the entrance-gateway is well preserved, with
its flanking round towers, portcullis, and ancient doors. Here lived Charles I. and two of
his children. A small stone building within the enclosure covers the famous well of Carisbrooke,
sunk in Stephen's days, two hundred and forty feet deep, of which ninety feet are filled with
water. A solemn donkey in a big wooden wheel works the treadmill that winds the bucket up.
Formerly, every visitor dropped a pebble into the well to hear the queer sounds it made in
falling--"His head as he fell went knicketty-knock, like a pebble in Carisbrooke Well," used
to be a proverb--but as this amusement threatened to fill up the well, it has been prohibited.
The keep is at the north-eastern angle of the castle, polygonal in plan and of Norman architecture.
Carisbrooke was held for the empress Maud against Stephen, but the failure of the old well
in the keep, now filled up, caused its surrender. The new one, which has never been known to
give out, was then bored. In the reign of Charles I. the castle was invested by militia on
behalf of the Parliament, and was surrendered to them by the wife of the governor, the Countess
of Portland. She obtained specially advantageous conditions from the besiegers by appearing
on the walls with a lighted match and threatening to fire the first cannon unless the conditions
were granted. King Charles I. took refuge here in November, 1647, but soon found he was practically
a prisoner. He remained ten months, twice attempting to escape. On the first occasion he tried
to squeeze himself between the bars of his window, but stuck fast; on the second his plan was
divulged, and on looking out the window he found a guard ready to entrap him below. He was
taken to Newport and surrendered himself to the Parliamentary commissioners, but was ultimately
returned to Carisbrooke. Then some army officers removed him suddenly to Hurst Castle on the
mainland, and thence he was taken to Windsor and London for the trial that ended on the block
at Whitehall. Two of his children were imprisoned in Carisbrooke with him--the young Duke of
Gloucester, afterwards sent to the Continent, and the princess Elizabeth, who died here in
childhood from a fever. She was found dead with her hands clasped in the attitude of prayer
and her face resting on an open Bible, her father's last gift. She was buried in an unmarked
grave in Newport Church, but the coffin was discovered in 1793, and when the church was rebuilt
in 1856 Queen Victoria erected a handsome monument over the little princess, the sculptor representing
her lying on a mattrass with her cheek resting on the open Bible, the attitude in which she
had been found. Newport has some ten thousand population.

TENNYSON'S HOME.

Tennyson's pretty home is at Farringford, near Freshwater, on the western slope of the Isle
of Wight, just where it begins to contract into the long point of the chalk-cliffs that terminate
with the Needles. At Brixton, on the south-western coast, is Bishop Ken's parsonage, where
William Wilberforce spent the closing years of his life. The little rectory here is honorably
distinguished as having given to the Church of England three of its famous prelates: Bishop
Ken, one of the martyrs whom James II. imprisoned in the Tower, and whose favorite walk is
still pointed out in the pretty garden; Bishop Samuel Wilberforce of Winchester, whose unfortunate
death occurred not long ago at Evershed Rough; and the present Bishop Moberly of Salisbury.
The western extremity of the Isle of Wight is a peninsula, almost cut off from the main island
by the little river Yar, which flows into the Solent at Yarmouth. This is known as the Freshwater
Peninsula, and presents almost unrivalled attractions for the tourist and the geologist. The
coast-walk around the peninsula from Freshwater Gate to Alum Bay extends about twelve miles.
The bold and picturesque chalk-cliffs tower far above the sea, their dazzling whiteness relieved
by the rich green foliage. Some of these hills rise four hundred feet, forming the chalk-downs
that are the backbone of this most attractive island. Among these hills are bewitching little
vales and glens, and almost every favored spot is availed of as a villa site. No part of England
is more sought as a place of rural residence than this richly-gifted isle, thus set as a gem
upon the southern shore of the kingdom.

THE NEEDLES.

With the terminating western cliffs of the chalk-hills of the Isle of Wight beyond High Down
we will close this pleasant journey. The far-famed Needles are a row of wedge-like masses of
hard chalk running out to sea in the direction of the axis of the range of hills. They do not
now much resemble their name, but in earlier years there was among them a conspicuous pinnacle,
a veritable needle, one hundred and twenty feet in height, that fell in 1764. At present the
new lighthouse, built at the seaward end of the outermost cliff, is the nearest approach to
a needle. The headland behind them is crowned by a fort several hundred feet above the sea.
There were originally five of these pyramidal rocks, but the waves are continually producing
changes in their form, and now but three of them stand prominently out of the water.

       *       *       *       *       *

And now our task is done. The American visitor landing at Liverpool has been conducted through
England, and has been shown many of its more prominent attractions, but not by any means all
of them, for that would be an impossible task. But he has been shown enough to demonstrate
the claim of the mother-country to the continued interest of the Anglo-Saxon race from beyond
the sea; and to this pleasant panorama and description there cannot be given a better termination
than at the lovely Isle of Wight, the perfection of English scenery and climate, whereof Drayton
has written,

  "Of all the southern isles, she holds the highest place,
  And evermore hath been the great'st in Britain's grace;
  Not one of all her nymphs her sovereign favoreth thus,
  Embracèd in the arms of old Oceanus."
