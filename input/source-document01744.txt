DEDICATION.

To

 My Wife

 Without whom the following pages
 could not have been written.

“Yes, it shall come! E’en now my eyes behold, In distant view, the wish’d for age unfold, Lo,
o’er the shadowy days that roll between, A wand’ring gleam foretells th’ ascending scene. Oh,
doom’d victorious from thy wounds to rise, Dejected India, lift thy downcast eyes, And mark
the hour, whose faithful steps for thee Through Time’s press’d ranks bring on the Jubilee!”

PREFACE.

The following pages are, practically, the result of a course of lectures given, on the Hyde
foundation, at the Andover Theological Seminary in the fall of 1902. Some of the chapters were
also used in lectures, delivered during the year, at the Yale and Hartford Theological Seminaries
and at the Western Reserve University. Small portions have appeared in Reviews and Magazines
but have been much changed in the transfer. The cordial welcome accorded the lectures, including
an expressed desire that they be published, has led to their appearance in this more permanent
form.

India should be better known to Europe and America. I trust that the following pages may help
the student to understand the vast country and to realise the greatness of the problems connected
with Christian work in the land; may they also stir within many a strong desire to present
Christ to that great people, and inspire a hope in the ultimate and speedy triumph of our cause
in the land of the Vedas.

I gratefully express my indebtedness to the Rev. J. L. Barton, D. D., for his valuable suggestions
and kindly sympathy, and also to the Rev. W. P. Elwood for his kind help in proofreading.

THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE.

No country in the Orient is of greater interest to the West today than is India. It is picturesque
in its life, wonderful in its history, remarkable in its present conditions and fascinating
in its promise for the future.

It is a land most worthy of study both for what it has been, for what it is and for what it
is to become; as the arena for the greatest conflict upon which our Faith and Civilization
have ever entered; and for their most magnificent triumph in the world.

Moreover, India is now peculiarly wedded to the Anglo-Saxon race. For good or for evil the
destiny of that country, socially, politically, intellectually and religiously, is linked with
that of the Anglo-Saxon; and we, as a part of the Anglo-Saxon race, cannot, even if we would,
shake off our connection with, and responsibility for, it.

1. The Physical Features of That Land.

It is a very extensive land. More a continent than a country, it stretches, from east to west,
a distance of 1,900 miles; and it extends the same distance from the Himalayas on the north
to Cape Comorin on the south. It covers an area equal to one-half of that of the United States.

It is physically divided into three portions. The first, on the north, includes the Himalaya
Mountains, which separate it from the rest of Asia and which furnish an important element in
the meteorological conditions of the country. Then from the base of this mountain range extend
the plains of the great rivers which issue from the mountains themselves. Again, from the southern
boundaries of these plains gradually rises a very extensive three-sided table-land reaching
towards the coast on both eastern and western sides, and extending to Cape Comorin on the south.
There may be added to this the narrow strips of coast-land on the east and west. In the land
are found some of the greatest and most wonderful rivers in the world. The Ganges, which is
the queen of Indian rivers, carries life and fertility to a population greater than that of
the whole United States. After a course of 1,557 miles it empties, into the Bay of Bengal,
1,800,000 cubic feet of water per second, which is half as much again as the water of the Mississippi,
and nearly six times as much as that of the Nile at Cairo.

It is a land wonderful in the variety of its climates. It is difficult to imagine greater contrasts
than those existing between the various climates of India—from the eternal snows in the north
to the fierce and constant heat of the tropics in the south; from the practically rainless
expanse of the western plains of Sind to the 600 inches of rainfall which deluges the eastern
mountain slopes. No land is more extensively cultivated and none gives more fruit in return
for human labour than India. The Ganges, by the abundant silt which it carries, brings fertility
and fruitfulness to its valleys. Even the plains of Sind, which are nearly rainless, are transformed
into life by large irrigation schemes.

Rice, wheat and millets are the three staples of the country. In the north, wheat furnishes
sixty per cent. of the cultivated area. This total area under wheat cultivation in India is
estimated to be equal to that of all the wheat-fields of the United States. One-fourth of the
population of India lives on rice; and various kinds of millets represent fifty-two per cent.
of the whole cultivation of the land. Though the methods of cultivation there are primitive
and the implements used inadequate for best results, yet through the rich climatic conditions
and the persistent efforts of the people the land normally yields an abundance of good things
for the support of its inhabitants.

2. The People.

The people of India number, according to the census of 1901, 291,236,000—about one-fifth of
the inhabitants of the globe. This population represents more races than are found in the whole
of Europe. Besides many small tribes, it has eleven nations, the least of which numbers 2,250,000
souls. Of these nations seven are of Aryan, and four of Dravidian, extraction; and they differ
in physique, temperament and language. Between the sturdy Aryan on the north and the degraded
primitive people on the plains of the south there is a great gulf. Between the clever and subtle
Baboo of Bengal and the war-like Marahtta of the west, the bold, spirited Pathan in the north
and the passive but enduring Dravidian in the south, there are many intermediate classes which
furnish wonderful diversity of character and temperament. Among these people there is not,
and cannot at present be, a sense of oneness. Until recently their whole civilization tended
to emphasize their divergence, to broaden the breach between them and to cultivate a perpetual,
mutual jealousy and hatred.

The languages spoken by these people are, according to the census of 1891, seventy in number.(1)
Of these the Sanskrit is the oldest, and may truly be called the mother tongue of the country.
It is one of the most ancient languages in the world, with a history of more than 3,000 years.
It is strong, pliant, expressive—a worthy vehicle of noble thought and religious aspiration.
Though not spoken today by any tribe or people, it is not a dead language, for it is the religious
tongue of India. The best thought, the deepest philosophy, the highest religious aspiration,
the laws, customs and legends of the people are treasured in that tongue. All who would know
the religious life and thought of India at its best and in its sources, should study Sanskrit.
From it have sprung many of the languages of Modern India. In the northern and northwestern
parts, the Aryan tongues find supremacy. Although these languages differ greatly among themselves,
their source and vocabulary is mainly Sanskrit. Of all Indian languages, the one most widely
spoken is the Hindi—88,000,000 people use it as their mother tongue. Forty-one millions speak
Bengali, 18,000,000 speak Punjabi, 19,000,000, Marathi, 11,000,000 speak Gujurathi.

The Dravidian languages of South India are entirely separate from the Aryan group, their source
and character being Turanian. These languages are Tamil, Telugu, Kanarese and Malayalam. Fifty-three
million people speak these tongues alone.

The inhabitants of India are an ancient people. When thirty centuries ago our ancestors were
grovelling in the lowest depths of primitive savagery, our fellow-Aryans of India were enjoying
a civilization of their own, which was, in its way, unique and distinguished. Their philosophy
shows testimony to their ancient glory. It may truly be said that their chief glory is to be
found more in ancient than in modern times. It is a people whose progress has, in some respects,
been backward rather than forward, and whose boast is rightly of what they have been rather
than of what they are.

It is a conservative people. India is a land where custom is deified—the past is their glory.
Today, we are living, they say, in the iron age (Kali Yuga), in which righteousness is all
but lost. Hindu law has conserved the past—it exalts past observances above those of the present.
Under such a system all innovations are out of place, individual ambitions are crushed. To
resemble their ancestors is the summum bonum of their life.

The inhabitants of that land are a rural people. Unlike western countries, India has very few
large towns. Nine-tenths of the whole population live in villages of less than 5,000, four-fifths
live in villages of under 1,000 inhabitants. The average village of India today contains 363
inhabitants. During the last few years the tendency has been towards towns. But the large increase
in the population is still to be seen in rural regions. In India two-thirds of the villages
have less than 200 inhabitants each, while 1,000 have from 5,000 to 10,000 inhabitants. Notwithstanding
this fact, the population, in some parts of the country, is very dense. The whole of Bengal
furnishes 360 persons to the square mile, and in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh the
total per square mile rises to 416.

Owing to modern methods of sanitation, to peace and to general prosperity, the population has
grown and is growing rapidly.(2) There is already one person to every two acres of land in
the country; and under the British Government the prosperity of India is largely measured by
the growth of the population; and this in turn seriously increases the difficulty of providing
for the wants of the people. Indeed it has become one of the hardest problems which confronts
the Indian government; and the difficulty is considerably enhanced by the religion of the country
which demands that every man and woman marry and add to the population, regardless of any question
as to health or even sanity. In India the first privilege and duty of man and woman is supposed
to be the propagation of their kind.

3. Economic Conditions.

One of the most marked characteristics of India is its poverty. The people, as a whole, have
always been extremely poor. There has been some wealth in the land; but it has not been evenly
distributed. While a few nabobs have enjoyed immense treasures, the people, as a whole, have
grovelled in the lowest depth of penury and want. There is better distribution of wealth today
than ever before; and yet the poverty of the masses continues to be a serious feature of the
land. “Its finance lies at the base of every difficulty connected with our Indian Empire,”
is the remark of Sir Charles Dilke. And at the base of the finance difficulty lies the poverty
of the people. It is a well known and lamentable fact that one-fifth of the population, say
sixty millions, are insufficiently fed even in ordinary years of prosperity. They are the ever
ready prey of the first drought, distress or famine that may happen. It is a not uncommon experience
of the ryot (or farmer) to retire at night upon an empty stomach. The average income of the
common labourer in India is between four and five rupees, or, say, $1.50 per month.

Most of this evil which the people endure is self-imposed. They reveal a combination of blind
improvidence, reckless expenditure and an unwillingness to shake off impoverishing customs.
For instance, the debt incurring propensity of the native is akin to insanity. All the poor
people with whom I am acquainted are bound hand and foot by this terrible mill-stone. And the
interest paid upon loans is crushing. Two and three per cent. per month is an interest commonly
received. It is rare that a poor farmer who gets into the clutches of the money lender regains
his freedom. It usually leads to the loss of all property and means of support. Under the ancient
Hindu law no money lender could recover interest upon a loan beyond the amount of the principal
which he had advanced; under the present rule he can recover to any extent, sell the tenant’s
crops and even take possession of the land under a judgment decree. It is one of those instances
where justice in law is made to minister unrighteousness and cruelty in life. The people moreover
are given to the most extravagant expenses at marriages and funerals. It is frequently the
case that a man spends upon the marriage of his son or daughter, the latter especially, more
than a whole year’s income. I know of many who are overwhelmed by debts incurred for the marriage
of their children; and the saddest thing about it is that they have little option in this expense;
for it is prescribed by caste custom.

Add to this the rank growth of religious mendicancy, under the fostering care of religious
teaching and superstition. There are five and one-half millions of such lazy, worthless fellows
encumbering that land today. The mass of them are sleek in body and pestilential in morals.
Whenever a man finds work too hard, he dons the yellow cloth of the religious mendicant and
becomes an immediate success. But alas for the community! Hindu charity is proverbial, but
it is blinder than love itself. Such a body of worthless consumers would tax even a wealthy
land. To India it is a dreadful burden and drain.

Add to this the insane passion for jewels which consumes both high and low. Millions of rupees’
worth of gold flows into the country annually, and most of it is melted and converted into
personal adornments for women and children. For this purpose nearly one-half million goldsmiths,
according to the last census, are employed and make a comfortable living at an annual expense
of ten million dollars. This is a much larger force of workmen than that of all the blacksmiths
in the land.

The litigious spirit of the people is also phenomenal. It is doubtful if any other people on
earth spend, relative to their means, more in legal processes than the Hindus. In view of all
these facts, Sir W. W. Hunter’s statement that “The permanent remedies for the poverty of India
rest with the people themselves” is eminently true. It is further emphasized by the remarks
of Sir Madhava Rao, K. C. S. I., one of the very few statesmen whom India has produced among
her own children: “The longer one lives, observes and thinks,” he says, “the more deeply does
he feel there is no community on the face of the earth which suffers less from political evils
and more from self-inflicted, self-accepted, or self-created, and therefore avoidable, evils
than the Hindu community.”

Famine is an oft-recurring and most perplexing evil with which India has always been familiar.
In times past, it was the gaunt Avenger which decimated the people and which kept down the
population within the range of tolerable existence. The god of dirt and insanitation carried
away the unneeded residue left by famine. Famine is one of the very few evils before which
human power stands helpless. The government has done very much by irrigation schemes and by
the building of railways to mitigate this evil. By famine funds and relief works it strives,
as it did the last famine, to reduce the mortality and suffering arising from these seasons
of drought. But the constant penury of the people, and the fact of their always living upon
the verge of hunger and want, make it almost impossible to save many from the terrible result
of such visitations. Perhaps there is no other thing, at present, which occupies more of the
time and thought of the Imperial Government than this; but, to drive entirely away this hideous
demon from a land which is peculiarly liable to drought, and while the people are chronically
unprepared to meet the least extra drain, is more than can be expected from any government.

The railroads of the land are manifestations of the material progress which meet one on all
sides. In the extent of its railroads India is the fifth country in the world. Already the
splendid railway system, upon which travel is as comfortable as, and perhaps cheaper than,
in any other country in the world, has extended 23,000 miles and reaches the remotest parts
of the land. These throbbing arteries carry life and enterprise to all portions of India; and
many regions not yet made thus accessible will soon listen to the neigh of the iron horse and
feel the pulsations of new life thereby. Three hundred million pounds sterling have been expended
in this work alone.

But better, if possible, than these roads is the rapidly developing irrigation system which
brings security of life and works prosperity wherever it reaches. Nearly 14,000,000 acres are
now cultivated under this system. This includes fourteen and eight-tenths per cent. of all
cultivated land in India. One great enterprise in this line is the “Peryar Project” of South
India which was large in its conception, perfect in its execution and is rich in its blessings.
It consists in the diversion of a large river which vainly poured its treasures down the western
mountainside into the Arabian Sea, and causing its waters to flow into the eastern plains to
fertilize the thirsty land as far as the Bay of Bengal. It embraces the second largest dam
in the world, a tunnel one and one-fourth miles through the mountain, and many miles of distributing
channels. It will irrigate at least 150,000 acres for rice cultivation and will feed 400,000
people. I live in the heart of the region thus fertilized and refreshed, and know the joy of
the residents who also stand astonished before the magic power of these white people who do
for them what, they say, even their gods failed to accomplish. It is well to remember that
these irrigation schemes, now found in India, are much the most extensive in any country.

Looking at her commerce during the Victorian reign alone, we see a growth of 1,000 per cent.
in the imports and exports of India. The export of tea has risen from nothing to 70,000 tons,
and that of cotton from nothing to 220,000 tons. There are now in the land 150 cotton-mills
with 150,000 labourers. Three million tons of coal are annually mined, and gold mines yield
£1,000,000 sterling every year. It may, indeed, be said that India has now, for the first time
in its history, taken a place as a land of manufactures, trade and commerce.

4. Social Life.

The contrast between the social life of the East and that of the West is marked. Problems that
today stir this land to its depth have no existence in India. The conservatism of India is
proverbial. The Hindu people have been kept back from all progress, so that questions arising
about human rights and liberty have not begun to be mooted there. The thousand problems of
our land are the direct result of the emphasis which our civilization has given to human rights
and individual freedom and the equality of men. India has thus far denied to the individual
those rights and liberties which are deemed elementary and fundamental in the West. Its emphasis
has always been upon the rights and privileges of Society as a corporate body. It has ignored
entirely the claims of the individual and has prevented him from enjoying his inalienable rights
in any division of society. This may be seen in the two great departments of life in that land.

(a) The Family.

The family systems of the East and of the West are essentially different. In India the Joint
Family System prevails. According to this system members of a family for three generations
live together and have all things in common. No member of the family can claim anything as
his own. It is the old patriarchal system and emphasizes the rights of the family as a whole,
and denies to any individual member separate possession or privileges. This system has had
a long day in India; but, as western ideas are spreading, dissatisfaction is manifestly increasing,
especially among the educated classes. The recent introduction to the Madras Legislature of
the so-called “Gains of Learning Bill” is the first serious attack made upon that system. By
means of this bill, which was introduced by an orthodox Hindu, but which is not yet passed,
an educated man could claim exclusive right to ownership of all properties acquired by him
through his education. Thus, for the first time in India an individual might claim, apart from
the family, that wealth which was acquired by himself. This bill has brought opposition from
the public, because it conflicts with the rights of the joint family, and is a serious blow
to all the old Hindu family privileges. The Hindu joint family system, while it has been a
source of some blessing to the land, has also been a serious curse in that it has fostered
laziness, dissension and improvidence, and has put a ban upon individual initiative and ambition.

Child marriages have been an unfailing source of evil to the land. Of this Sir John Strachey
says: “It would be difficult to imagine anything more abominable than the frequent consequences
of child marriages by which multitudes of girls of ten to twelve or less are given over to
outrage; or, if they belong to the higher class of Hindus, are doomed to lives of degraded
widowhood.”

The Indian government has endeavoured to remove this evil; but at all points it has been opposed
not only by conservative, orthodox Hindus, but also by educated members of the community. No
system can degrade the womanhood of a race, nor, indeed, for that matter, its manhood, more
than that which marries its girls in childhood and which consigns millions of them to wretched
widowhood. One of the consequences is that girls of even twelve years are known to become mothers
in that land, while very few attain the age of eighteen without bearing children. An increasing
population under these physical conditions cannot be a healthy or a vigorous one.

(b) Society.

In India, Society is almost exclusively the product of the ancient caste system. A more elaborate
social system than this was never known in the world. It is an order of social tyranny of the
worst sort, whereby every man is compelled to give up his own individuality and to be bound
to the iron will of an ignorant community: a will also which is based upon the past and conforms
to the rules and habits of peoples who lived in remote antiquity. No greater millstone could
be hung around the neck of any people than that of the multitudinous caste rules of Manu and
later accretions which are the all in all of Hindu life. There may have been good in this system
in the past, and it may have conserved some blessings of antiquity; but today it is the worst
tyranny and the greatest curse that has blasted the life of the people. It is the source of
their physical degeneracy, for it compels them to marry within narrow lines of consanguinity.
It has cursed the people with a narrow sympathy; for no man in that system deems it his duty
to bless or help those beyond his own caste. It has sown poverty broadcast over the land; for
it prohibits a man from engaging in any work or trade which is not prescribed by caste rules
and customs; and thus has brought many to penury, want and famine. When the caste-prescribed
occupation or work is not available, the suffering is very great.

It has brought stagnation to the people by restraining every man who had ambition to move forward
and improve his prospects in life. The whole village regards as conceited a young man of the
outcastes who seeks to rise in life; they soon bring him low. Progress is impossible under
the caste system.

In like manner, it has fostered the pride and presumption of one class and destroyed the ambition
and aspiration of the other. No people on earth today are more proud than the Brahmans; none
more hopelessly abject than the Pariahs and other outcastes.

It has also made national unity and the spirit of fellowship impossible in the land; large
corporate interests are impossible for the people. The castes of the community are filled with
jealousy and are mutually antagonistic; each division having rules and ceremonies which make
it impossible for communion of interests with others. Many would like to see it removed; but
the system itself has created such abjectness of feeling among them that they dare not come
forward to stem its tide or oppose it.

5. The Educational System.

Ignorance still rests like a pall upon that land. According to the census of 1891, out of a
total population of 261,840,000, 133,370,000 were males. Of these, 118,819,000 were analphabet.
Including boys under instruction, only 14,550,000 could read and write. Of the 128,470,000
females only 740,000 could read and write or were being instructed. In other words, only eleven
per cent. of the males and a little more than one-half of one per cent. of the females were
in any sense literate. In Madras, we find the greatest progress; but even there eighty-five
per cent. of the male and ninety-nine per cent. of the female population are illiterate. In
Oudh, on the other hand, corresponding figures are ninety-four and very nearly one hundred
per cent. When it is remembered that the Brahmans, who constitute only five per cent. of the
total population, include seventeen per cent. of the literate class and more than twenty per
cent. of those who know English, it can be understood that the illiteracy of the common people
is still greater than that indicated by the above figures.

Considerable effort has been made by the government to educate this immense population. It
is seriously handicapped in this endeavour by want of funds. The State does not largely enter
into the establishing of schools of its own; its policy being to give grants in aid to private
bodies on the basis of results achieved. And it contents itself with the establishing and conducting
of relatively only a few schools of its own which shall serve as models and as a stimulus to
the private aided institutions. More than three-fourths of the education of the land is thus
conducted by private bodies which are encouraged by the government through its grants in aid.
There still remain not a few indigenous or, so-called, “piall” schools. Educationally, these
schools are of little value, as their training is both antiquated in kind and extremely limited
in quantity. They are interesting because they reveal to us the old educational methods of
the land. Schools on modern lines, however, by coming under government surveillance, for the
purpose of receiving grants in aid, are conducted much more efficiently, and attain results
worthy to be compared with those of western lands. The chief feature of the educational system,
controlled, examined and aided by government, is the emphasis given to an English training.
From the second year of instruction, the English language grows annually in importance in the
curriculum of studies. In the grammar school it becomes compulsory and in the high school and
college it is the sole medium of the communication of knowledge. The English language is emphasized
also because it is the test for admission even into many of the lowest of the numberless offices
in connection with government service; so that the study of this language of the West has become
to young India practically a necessity and a craze. People of the lowest conditions in life
pawn and mortgage their property and involve themselves in terrible debts for the sake of giving
their sons an English education.

Christian missions constitute one of the principal bodies which engage in the training of Hindu
youth. One-ninth of all the school children of India are found in mission schools. This number
includes 330,000 boys and nearly 100,000 girls. In the training of girls, Protestant missions
have not only been pioneers; they are also today much the most prominent and efficient educators
of the women of the land. Their girls’ schools and colleges are not only the most numerous,
but also the most efficiently conducted and thoroughly managed of all institutions for women
in India. The Madras Christian College for boys and the Sarah Tucker Woman’s College of Tinnevelly
are among the best institutions for those classes in India. The educational system of India
culminates in the five Universities of Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Allahabad and Lahore. These
are not instructing, but simply examining universities like the University of London. With
these the 140 colleges of two grades and of various degrees of efficiency, are affiliated.
In these colleges are found 18,000 students of whom more than 5,000 graduate yearly. The city
of Calcutta is a city of many colleges and has more college students, relative to its population,
than almost any city of the West.

Though the masses of the people, and especially the women, are still, as we have seen, grossly
ignorant, yet every year encouraging progress is being made in spreading the blessings of,
and in creating a taste for, education. Every year natives themselves enter more largely into
the educational work and find in it not only a living, but noble scope for their activities.
Among the higher and cultured classes there is a growing body of young men, besides the ambitious
few from the lower classes, crowding into the higher institutions of the land. It is one of
the problems of the day to direct the mind of this increasing army of university graduates
to other professions than the overcrowded government service. There is a persistent feeling
among these youth that it is the business of State to supply them with lucrative posts upon
their graduation. And it is the disappointed element of this class which furnishes so many
of the discontented, blatant demagogues who are almost a menace to the land.

Yet this educational work is one of the potent, leavening influences of the country, and is
helping greatly in carrying quietly forward one of the mightiest revolutions that have been
witnessed in any land. In its train follows closely the social elevation of the people. The
relaxation of the terrible caste system, the elevation of woman and her redemption from some
of the cruelties and injustice of the past, immediately attend that expanding knowledge which
results from the schools of the land.

Protestant missions are preëminent in their work of educating the Christian communities gathered
together by them.(3) Though these communities are largely drawn from the lowest outcasts, yet
they compare favourably, in their educational equipment, with the highest classes. This is
a significant indication of their present, and a bright promise for their future, position
among the people of India.

6. The Political Situation.

India today is politically a subject country. Though in one sense England did not directly
subjugate India, it is nevertheless true that its inhabitants, though treated with large consideration,
are today a subject people—ruled by a foreign nation 7,000 miles away. Hence, it might be expected
that political rights and privileges would not prevail there as among a self-governing, entirely
independent, people. The existence of an army of about 75,000 Britons in that land today is
significant of the situation and partly reveals one grip with which Great Britain holds India
and makes it a part of her great empire. I do not wish to minimize the moral power with which
also, and increasingly, Great Britain draws India by sweet compulsion to herself; of this I
shall speak later.

It should also be remembered that the genius of the Orient is not for self-government; in the
East, people have little taste for free institutions; they have always craved, and found their
greatest happiness and chief welfare in, a strong paternal government. The ordinary Hindu seeks
for himself nothing higher than a government which, while not asking for his opinion concerning
its policy and acts, will at least dispense a fair modicum of justice to him and his.

Notwithstanding all this, the Indian government has bestowed upon the people a wonderfully
large meed of power and privilege. Political progress in the land is one of the marvels of
the past century. Before the British entered India that land had never enjoyed the first taste
of representative institutions. Today the query which arises in the mind of disinterested persons
who know and love India is, whether political rights and liberties have not, of late years,
been conferred too rapidly upon them. It should not be expected that a people who, by instinct
and unbroken heritage, are the children of the worst kind of autocratic and absolute government,
should acquire, in one age or century, wisdom or aptitude to rule themselves. The mass of Hindus
love to be led and they follow easily.

But there is a small and growing party of the soil who have aptly learned many of the lessons
taught them by the rulers. The best acquired of all these lessons is that of the power of agitation
and of the efficacy among the Anglo-Saxon race of the cry for human rights. The only difficulty
is that one might suppose, from the language of some of these men that England has not yet
conceded to worthy Indians any of those political privileges which every Anglo-Saxon citizen
demands for himself. As a matter of fact, we see in the municipalities of that land a form
of popular government such as even not all western countries enjoy. The power of the franchise,
in the election of municipal commissioners, is vested in all those who are possessed of the
least amount of property. Even women enjoy the franchise; and it is a curious fact that the
natives of South India have recently protested in the newspapers against the granting of this
power to women, because, they say, the power is exercised only by “dancing girls” and other
public characters. To those who watch carefully the working of this right of municipal franchise
and see how easily and speedily the natives have adopted all the vices and tricks of the system,
it does not by any means seem an unmixed good. And the hardest critics of the system that I
have met have been intelligent and loyal Indians who believe that this meed of self-government
is fraught with evil. The District Boards also are composed almost entirely of native gentlemen,
and they have large powers in the administration of the internal affairs of the land. Moreover
these municipal and local bodies, together, elect members for provincial legislative bodies
where they enjoy recently enlarged powers for interpellating the government—a power which,
by excessive use or abuse, they may soon forfeit.

To all this must be added the freedom of the press, which also has recently been abused by
the dissemination of disloyal and seditious sentiments, but which adds immensely to the powers
of the people.

Then the “National Congress” is a peculiar institution which, while it gives scope to the political
aspirations of many natives, adds, by its very existence, to the lustre of the British Raj
in the land. Just imagine for a moment the existence of such a Congress under Russian rule!
It is true that this Congress, which meets annually in some great city of the land, has no
connection with government or legislative bodies and has only that power and influence which
inhere in its deliberations and resolutions. It is also true that up to the present it has
given itself largely to the criticism and abuse of government. By this it has alienated some
of its best friends. Still, even as a public censor it has doubtless done good, and offers
to the discontented a wholesome vent for pent up feelings. It is also a remarkable gathering
in its numbers of cultured men and illustrates one of the wonders which Great Britain has accomplished
in that land. To think, that out of the babel of Indian tongues there should gather together
in one place annually some 5,000 native gentlemen to discuss questions of State, and to criticise
one of the most modern of governments in the pure English accents of Addison or of Macaulay!
What a wonderful object lesson of progress this!

Nor is Great Britain as remiss or as selfish as many would lead us to believe in the distribution
of the loaves of office. There are only 122,661 male Britishers in that land (including the
army)—one to every 2,500 of the population. Of these, only 750 are found in the higher offices
of government. In the Provincial Services 2,449 natives are employed in high judicial and administrative
posts. It is a significant fact that out of 114,150 appointments, carrying Rs.(4) 1,000 annually,
ninety-seven per cent, are in the hands of natives. To all offices, below that of the Governor
of the Province, natives are eligible. As Judges of the High Court and as Members of the legislative
bodies not a few Indians are found; as they are also in the Indian Civil Service which was
so long exclusively filled by Anglo-Indians. It hardly appears how England can hold that great
land to herself, as a member of her empire, with fewer of her own citizens than are now found
at the helm. Nor does it yet appear that a strong, efficient and acceptable government can
be maintained there by a large reduction of this force. I use the word “acceptable” advisedly;
and it is certainly the business of Great Britain to discover and consult the wishes of the
people—not of the hungry office seekers—in this matter. After many years of observation and
of living among the people, I am convinced that nine-tenths of them are prepared any day to
vote in favour of the relative increase, and not the decrease, of the European official force.
The people have found them to be just and honest; they know that they can be depended upon
to administer justice with an even hand and that they are incorruptible. In their own native
officials they have no confidence. They have found, alas, too often that justice is sold by
them to the highest bidder. The “middle men” who arrange such matters are too commonly known
as the accompaniments of the native courts of justice. It is true that some native judges are
above such venality. But I know how general is the want of native confidence in native officials.
Many a time have I been importuned to use my influence to have cases transferred from the jurisdiction
of the native to the Englishman. And the reason invariably given is that “The white man will
not accept bribes and will give justice.” Indeed, it may be said that the chief difficulty
which confronts the Government in its great work is that of saving the people from low, mercenary
and unprincipled native officials—especially those of the lower and lowest grades.

The police department is corrupt to the core. The common people dread the policeman as they
do the highwayman; for the constable rarely touches a case without making money out of the
transaction; and he is expert in manufacturing cases.

What India needs today, above all else, is an honest, faithful, efficient class of officials.
The presence of a few English dignitaries found there is worth ten times its cost to the land,
purifying and toning up the service.

Considering the political situation as a whole, I confidently maintain that the people of India
enjoy political rights and privileges quite as extensively as they are prepared wisely to exercise
them. No people anywhere enjoy larger privileges, relative to their ability to use them wisely;
and no subject people on earth have ever been treated with larger consideration by their conquerors,
or have been more faithfully trained to enter upon an ever increasing sphere of opportunity
and of self-government. The political situation in India today—in the privileges and rights
which the people enjoy—is a marvellous testimony to the wisdom and unselfishness of Great Britain
in her Indian rule.

7. The Government of India.

The government of India is perhaps the most elaborate in the world; the highest powers of statesmanship
have been manifested by the successive rulers during more than a century in the development
of a State which is extraordinary no less in the complication of its provisions and details
than in the wise adaptation of human laws to meet the multitudinous exigencies of this great
conglomeration of peoples. It should also be remembered that British statesmen in their work
of legislation in India, and in their coordination of laws, have not only had to consider the
manifold character of the different portions of the population of the land; what is more difficult
still, they have been compelled to ingratiate themselves with the Indians by conserving, so
far as possible, those myriads of ancient laws and customs which obtain there. The laws of
Manu and of other writers of twenty-five centuries ago have been handed down by this people
through the ages and have accumulated authority and reverence with increasing time, until today
all Hindus regard them as divinely given and as possessing irresistible claim upon them for
all time. So that, while it may be said on the one hand that the laws of India are largely
built upon western foundations, and savour of Christian principles and modern ideas; it should
also be remembered, on the other hand, that the dicta of ancient Hindu lawgivers find a large
place in the legal codes of that land.

Yea, even more than this is true. There are a host of caste rules and customs which have no
further sanction than the fact that they have become customs, and yet which have been dignified
with the authority of law. This is of course due chiefly to the fact that most customs in India
have a religious basis and interpretation, and therefore draw to themselves that sanctity and
claim which belong to things religious. Thus, for instance, every caste in South India has
its own marriage customs. Most of these are highly incongruous with modern ideas and rights,
and most of them absolutely disregard the rights of the wife. And yet it has been deemed wise
by the State to conserve and to give the sanction of law to these multitudinous marriage customs
which are enough in themselves to constitute an extensive code.

Some conception of the magnitude of the work carried on by the Indian Government may be gathered
from the following description by Bishop Thoburn:—“With a population greater than that of the
five great powers of Europe put together; with a revenue exceeding $350,000,000; with a foreign
commerce worth $768,000,000 annually; with a standing army 230,000 strong, more than two-thirds
of which are composed of native soldiers; with a drilled police force of more than 150,000
men; with a code of laws in many respects superior to those found on the statute books of European
countries; and with courts of justice as impartial and as faithfully conducted as any to be
found in the world, India may well claim a place among the great empires of the present era.”

The British Government has respected the possessions of native chiefs in whose hands still
remain about one-third of the country. But these so called native territories are so largely
under English control and guidance that we may well regard them as essentially a part of the
British Domain.

The Secretary of State for India has practically the control of British Indian affairs. He,
with his council in London, has the final word in Indian matters of paramount importance. Nevertheless,
the Indian Government finds this power rarely antagonistic in matters whereon it has firmly
made up its mind.

The British possessions in India are distributed into twelve governments, each separately organized
and yet all of them constituting parts of the Supreme Government of India. This Supreme Government
is administered by a Governor-General or Viceroy with whom is associated a Council of six members.
This Council constitutes the Viceroy’s Cabinet and each one has charge of a separate department
of the government.

Of the Provincial Governments of India, the principal ones are the Province of Bengal with
71,000,000, under a Lieutenant-Governor; United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, with a population
of 47,000,000, under a Lieutenant-Governor; Presidency of Madras, with 35,500,000, under a
Governor; Presidency of Bombay, with 18,800,000, under a Governor; and the province of Punjab,
with 20,800,000, under a Lieutenant-Governor.

The unit of government in India is the District. The whole of India is divided into 235 Districts.
At the head of a District is placed an officer known as Collector, Senior Magistrate, or Deputy
Commissioner, who is practically ruler of that division. He is the administrative representative
of the government. In each District there is also a District Judge and a few other officers
at the head of various departments. These Districts vary in size and population, covering areas
from 14,000 to 1,000 square miles, and containing from 3,000,000 to 250,000 population. The
average population of a District is 800,000. Nothing impresses the careful observer more than
the large amount of responsibility and the multifarious duties which devolve upon these District
officers. During recent years, however, authority has been withheld increasingly from Collectors
and centralized in the Provincial Governments; for at the head of every Province also there
is a government patterned somewhat after the Supreme Government in Calcutta.

No greater mistake can be made than to think that India is either crudely or poorly governed.
Owing to the great poverty of the land it is extremely difficult to maintain so costly and
elaborate a régime as the present one; and many claim that for the support of so expensive
a luxury the people are taxed beyond their ability and resources. The taxation imposed by a
government on its people is rightly considered, both in its extent and character, as a measure
of the wisdom of the State. The critics of the Indian government are prone to dwell upon the
alleged injustice of its taxes. It is, however, difficult to understand why this matter should
be pressed unless it be on the ground, apparently maintained, that the poverty of the people
should exempt them from any of the burdens of taxation—a theory beautifully generous to the
people but fatal to the maintenance of any government. The salt tax does certainly seem cruel
in its severe pressure upon the very poor; and yet it is the only one whereby this very large
part of the community can be reached at all, and made to contribute its mite to the State which
protects it.

Comparing present taxes with those of the past, we should certainly expect heavier imposts
now, because the government furnishes today, as an equivalent of protection and blessing, infinitely
more than former dynasties did. And yet Sir W. Hunter has ably shown from a comparison of taxes
levied by the present government and by the Moghul government that the modern Hindu is vastly
better off than was his ancestor of two and three centuries ago. Today, five and one half per
cent. is collected in land tax; under the Moghul rule they had to pay from thirty-three per
cent. to fifty per cent. Besides this, the Mohammedan imposed various other taxes, many of
them upon non-Mohammedans as a religious penalty. Nor were the Hindu governments one whit better
off; and even today the native states are much harder upon the people than is the British Raj.

The famine commission is the highest authority on the subject. In its exhaustive report of
1880 it writes:—“In the majority of native governments the revenue officer takes all he can
get, and would take treble the revenue we should, if he were strong enough to exact it.”

If we pursue the comparison to that of European peoples, Indian taxation would seem but a trifle.
Placing even English taxes side by side with India’s, we shall find instruction. The average
income in the United Kingdom is £40, while the tax assessed is 44s, or five and one-half per
cent. In India, alas, the average income is only 36s. But then the tax is only 1s, 9d per capita
which is a trifle smaller per capita than that for England. Here again we are impressed with
the reasonableness of the tax imposed.

The opium and liquor traffic in India is one which has drawn forth much criticism. From the
moral standpoint the critics have a very strong case. The evil which the opium traffic of India
has inflicted upon China—against her will too—has been enormous. The large army of opium eaters
which it has created, only to destroy with a terrible death, has long been an argument to which
no nation of England’s position and pretensions can render satisfactory reply.

In like manner, the State monopoly of the drink traffic is neither honourable nor wise. It
not only gives unwonted and unwarrantable dignity to a disreputable business, it also involves
the State in the business of making a large army of drunkards in the land. To take up a traffic
like this, for the revenue there is in it, is to trifle with the higher interests of the subjects
and to become instrumental in the corruption and misery of the people whom it is bound to protect.
It is questionable whether any other civilized government has involved itself in such unworthy
means of creating a revenue. Doubtless, opium and drink represent, morally, the weakest part
of this government. Of course, the all important defense lies in the revenue thus acquired.
These two items of revenue flow more easily than any others into the depleted treasury of State.
To give these up in behalf of what is termed sentiment, would necessitate the imposition of
other heavy taxes. This is an aspect of the question which too easily silences and secures
the acquiescence of the people of India. But, its evil is great and is spreading.

The drink curse is rapidly becoming one of the trying problems of India. It was slanderously
remarked some years ago that if the English then left that country the only monuments left
behind of their life would have been broken whiskey bottles! There is indeed ground today for
the fear that if England were to abandon the land, it would leave, as the saddest monument
of its past, an immensely increasing army of drinkers; and this evil is further enhanced by
the mean ideal of life which the ordinary Englishman sets before Hindus by his passion for
the cup. Half a century ago an Englishman died while on duty in the jungles in South India,
and his body was there buried in the wilderness. The natives soon erected a shrine over his
grave and, for a long time, offered, in true sobriety, whiskey and cheroots to appease his
thirsty and unsatisfied spirit! It is not strange that the natives should recognize a continuity
of spirit-taste in the here and the hereafter of the Sahib!

The recent utterance of the Archbishop of Canterbury on this subject should be heeded by the
State. “The true principle of morals,” he says, “is to have nothing whatever to do with that
which is shown to be necessarily productive of evil. The English nation caused the opium evil
in China and we are responsible for that evil. I also protest against the principle of raising
revenue by temptations to evil. It might be right for a government to pause before interfering
with private trade; but, in this case we ourselves are carrying on the evil trade. Such a thing
on the part of a great government is, I think, without a parallel in the whole world.”

The Army in India is a necessary but great evil in the expense which it involves to the government,
no less than in the evil life which it leads among, and the evil example which it sets, the
native community. Its influence is deplorable. It is the most vulnerable to attack of all departments
of government, both on the score of expense and character. “Tommy Atkins” is the greatest trial
to the Hindu, and brutally rides rough-shod over all his sensibilities. If he could only be
left at home with safety to British interests in the land, it would help largely to improve
the situation between the two races. It would also save England from the terrible disgrace
of immorality which the army is instrumental in carrying as a plague wherever it goes. Awful
indeed is the prevalence of the social vice in the native community itself; but the English
Army spreads the demoralization in a most disgraceful way.

Considering the government as a whole, then, it is wonderful, both in the extent of its operation
and in its numberless activities and agencies. Its purpose is generally noble, and its wisdom,
both in the framing of laws and in general administration, has been most marked. The occasion
of most of its failings and weaknesses is the poverty of the people whereby the government
has, at times, been driven to subterfuges to avoid bankruptcy.

8. The Mission of Great Britain in India.

The British people are only today beginning to realize fully the wonderful mission which, under
God’s providence, they are called to fulfill in that great land of the Vedas. For nearly a
century the commercial motive was not only paramount but was practically the only motive which
impelled the Anglo-Saxon in his contact with India. Everything Indian had value in his eyes
in proportion as it added to his revenues. For many years he excluded the Missionary of the
Cross from his domains in the East, lest that good man should, by teaching the people, disturb
the revenue of the Honourable East India Company. As the domains of this great company extended
and its powers multiplied, the English nation gradually came to realize their own responsibility
as a people to the land; and the Indians thus were brought within their influence. This contact
and communion of interests became to them the voice of responsibility and of obligation to
impart their blessings to them as well as to take their material resources from them. The dawn
of the new altruistic sense towards its subject people, though long deferred, rapidly grew
into full daylight; and Great Britain today feels, as no country has felt before, its privilege
and duty to bestow upon its dependency in the East the highest and best which it can furnish.

The difficulty of England’s mission in India is greatly enhanced by the difference which amounts
almost to a contrast between her own people and the inhabitants of India. The striking difference
of type and character existing between the Anglo-Saxon and the Hindu facilitates all sorts
of misunderstanding between them, and aids perceptibly in making the path of the British Raj
a very thorny one in the land. It would perhaps be impossible to find two peoples who are farther
removed from each other in temperament and training—whose nature and antecedents are more irreconcilable
at all points. While the Anglo-Indian is bold, frank and just, even to harshness, the Hindu
is subtle, affable, practiced to dissimulation, with ready susceptibilities to temporize and
to barter justice for expediency. On the one side, we see the Westerner haughty, unyielding
and unwilling to conciliate; on the other we behold the Oriental willing to be trampled upon
when it seems necessary, and to smile with apparent gratitude under the process; but, withal,
possessed of a large inheritance of ineradicable prejudices, which make a contact with his
too domineering Western lord an unceasing trial to him.

There is another point at which the two races are antipodal. The Briton is progressive to the
core. He only needs to be assured that a certain course is right and for the best interests
of the community, in order to adopt it. His face ever looks upward and his ambition is ever
to go forward. But, in India he lives among a race whose chief divinity is custom and the gist
of whose decalogue is, “Hold fast to the past.” As they approach a proposed enterprise their
first and last question concerning it is not whether it is right and best, but whether it is
in a line with the past and would be approved by their ancestors. The whole country has been
anchored for the last twenty-five centuries to a code of social laws and customs which are
more unyielding than the laws of the Medes and Persians. With them conservatism is the acme
of piety and propriety. All progress has been practically forced upon the country from without,
and in the teeth of their most sacred institutions and their most earnest protestation and
opposition. Thus the great difference between the two peoples has been a serious hindrance
to the realization of British designs in that land.

Notwithstanding all this, Great Britain has patiently, persistently and doggedly carried on
her work and pursued her highest ideals for India.

And what have been the ideals and blessings which she is seeking to achieve for that great land?

The first is that of Western culture and civilization. In these two particulars, England has
introduced into India a perpetual conflict. Western ideas, processes of thought, points of
aspect and ideals of beauty and of life have been gradually supplanting the very different
ones of the East. Western life in India today is a constant challenge to the people to study,
admire and appropriate its many features of thought and conduct; and India is not insensible
to this call. The railroads and hospitals, the schools and sanitary projects which have been
introduced by the West into that land are markedly transforming the sentiment and the life
of the people. The contrast between the people of India today and of a century ago is all but
complete in this respect. While the educational institutions of the land are revolutionizing
the thought, the more material elements of civilization are transforming the outer life of
the people.

England also is imparting to India the Anglo-Saxon conception of right, of law and of justice.
In order to know how widely apart the East and West were in this respect, one should live in
India a few years. The idea of equal rights to all the people, of freedom of speech, of liberty
of conscience and of other similar rights which are regarded as elementary and fundamental
in the West, was all but foreign to India when England established her power there. That the
government itself should treat high and low, the poor ryot and the wealthy rajah, the ignorant
Pariah and the cultured Brahman as one in their claim for right and protection, for justice
and for favour, seemed to the Hindu absurd. It is one of the best commentaries on British justice
and administration in India, that the people have now come not only to regard it with satisfaction,
but also as an indispensable condition of their life.

The blessings of peace also are among the greatest which England has conferred upon India.
“Pax Britanica” is equally known and loved today in India and in the British Isles. From time
immemorial India had been torn asunder, not only by internecine wars, but also by numerous
attacks from the peoples of other countries. India has always been a prey both to the decimating
wars of her own unjust and ambitious tyrants, and mutually antagonistic castes and tribes;
she has also been the easy victim of any hardy, enlightened, ambitious people who sought to
invade her. The presence of Great Britain in India has been a voice commanding peace to its
troubled and exhausted people. With a strong hand she has put down injustice of tribe against
tribe and made impossible inter-tribal wars and raids. She has brought rest such as India never
before enjoyed and has given safety to the most harmless and innocent classes, as she has peace
to the most warlike and aggressive in the land. This great land of the East has thus had opportunities
to grow and to develop in many of the most essential characteristics of individual and national
progress. These blessings would have been impossible apart from the peace which Great Britain
assured and wrought out for the land.

In connection with this we need to emphasize the various forms of progress which are an essential
part of British blessing to India. We have seen that India was a stagnant land, that its people
were preëminently unprogressive and ultra-conservative. England has helped her to break down
many of these barriers of the past. Though India is obstinately slow in her acceptance of the
spirit and blessings of progress, England has thrust upon her many of the conditions, and compelled
her to enter into some of the paths of progress which will bring inestimable benefits into
her life.

In like manner, the mission of England has been and is a religious one. Her Majesty, Queen
Victoria, upon assuming authority in the land, issued a proclamation to the effect that under
her reign all the inhabitants of India should enjoy perfect right to worship as they please
and whom they please. It is true that too many of the representatives of the British Government
in India today are so impressed with the importance of a government that is absolutely neutral
in religious matters, that they have both ceased themselves to manifest any religious preference
in their life and are scrupulously careful to see to it that Christians get just a little less
of right and of protection than the adherents of other faiths. This they consider to be true
altruism added to breadth of religious sentiment!

Notwithstanding this, nothing is more manifest in India today than that the very fact of the
rulers of the land being nominally Christians adds to the prestige of Christianity in the land.
The people naturally come to regard it as the State religion. What is more significant, however,
is the fact that, at the basis of modern laws in that land and of the multiplying institutions
of the country, distinctively Christian principles are universally recognized. Should the government
of India resolve to be absolutely neutral in all religious matters, it would have to renounce
those laws and institutions which have furnished it with all its success in the land and which
today crown its efforts with largest usefulness. To the government, and unconsciously to the
masses of the people, Christian thought and truth and method necessarily characterize most
of the laws, institutions and processes of India. They are all a part of the work of Great
Britain in that land and such a part as she could not dispense with if she would. It is a part
of her unconscious Christian heritage.

Thus the work of Great Britain in India has been attended with a large degree of success; it
has lifted the land out of a condition of semi-savagery and placed it among the civilized nations
of the world. It has cut it asunder from its anchorage to the past and brought it almost abreast
of the times. There is still much to be done and much to be desired. We shall be glad to see
the day when radical steps in progress shall be taken voluntarily by the people and through
the initiative of their own leaders, rather than that they should wait to have them thrust
upon them, as in the past, by the progressiveness of the foreigner among them.

The people, on the whole, appreciate the blessings of British supremacy in the land. If they
are not demonstratively loyal to the government, they certainly do rest satisfied in the progress
which has been achieved for them.

The well known political leader of Bengal, Babu Surendra Nath Banerji, recently expressed,
in the following eloquent words, the sentiment of the most thoughtful and influential natives
of the country.

“Our allegiance to the British rule,” he says, “is based upon the highest considerations of
practical expediency. As a representative of the educated community of India—and I am entitled
to speak on their behalf and in their name,—I may say that we regard British rule in India
as a dispensation of Divine Providence. England is here for the highest and the noblest purposes
of history. She is here to rejuvenate an ancient people, to infuse into them the vigour, the
virility and the robustness of the West, and so pay off the long-standing debt, accumulating
since the morning of the world, which the West owes to the East. We are anxious for the permanence
of British rule in India, not only as a guarantee for stability and order, but because with
it are bound up the best prospects of our political advancement. To the English people has
been entrusted in the Councils of Providence the high function of teaching the nations of the
earth the great lesson of constitutional liberty, of securing the ends of stable government,
largely tempered by popular freedom. This glorious work has been nobly begun in India. It has
been resolutely carried on by a succession of illustrious Anglo-Indian statesmen whose names
are enshrined in our grateful recollections. Marvellous as have been the industrial achievements
of the Victorian era in India, they sink into insignificance when compared with the great moral
trophies which distinguish that epoch. Roads have been constructed; rivers have been spanned;
telegraph and railway lines have been laid down; time and space have been annihilated; Nature
and the appliances of Nature have been made to minister to the wants of man. But these are
nothing when compared to the bold, decisive, statesmanlike measures which have been taken in
hand for the intellectual, the moral and the political regeneration of my countrymen. Under
English influences the torpor of ages has been dissipated; the pulsations of a new life have
been communicated to the people; an inspiriting sense of public duty has been evolved, the
spirit of curiosity has been stirred and a moral revolution, the most momentous in our annals,
culminating in the transformation of national ideals and aspirations, has been brought about.”

Great Britain has not been, and is not now, without failings in her work in India; and her
line of progress is studded with many errors. But she has been faithful to her trust and has
carried it out in no selfish way. The warm and deep loyalty of India bears testimony to this;
for native sentiment everywhere reveals marked appreciation.

                               Chapter II.

THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA.

India is the mother of religions. No other land has been so prolific in religious thought or
has founded faiths which have commanded the allegiance of so large a portion of the human race.
While the Aryans of the West have been content to borrow their faith from the Hebrews; Indo-Aryans
have produced the most wonderful and mighty ethnic religion (Brahmanism) and also one of the
three great missionary religions of the world (Buddhism). A third of the human race today cling
with devotion to these two products of the fertility of the mind, and the spirituality of the
heart, of India.

India’s toleration for other religions has been marked. For twelve centuries she has been the
asylum of Zoroastrianism. Nearly nine-tenths of the followers of that ancient cult of Persia
found and still enjoy a hospitable home in India. There are more of the narrow, bigoted followers
of Mohammed among these tolerant people than are found in any other land—even in the wide domains
of the Sultan. Christians also have lived, practically unmolested, in this great land almost
from Apostolic days.

Thus not a few of the great Faiths of the world are at present represented, and are struggling
either for existence or dominance, in the land of the Vedas.

The principal faiths of the land, with their adherents, were as follows, according to census
of 1891:

Hindu          207,731,727 Sikh             1,907,838 Jain             1,416,638 Buddhist(5)
7,131,361 Parsee              89,904 Mohammedan      57,231,164 Jewish              17,000
Christian(6)     2,284,000

Let us consider these faiths briefly. It will be seen that Christianity has, as its followers,
only one per cent. of the whole population of the land.

(a) Judaism.

The Jewish Community in India numbers only 17,000; these are found mostly in Bombay and Poonah.
Perhaps the most interesting colony of them is that on the west coast in Cochin. I had the
pleasure of visiting them in 1897. There are 1,500 of them divided into two sections—the White,
and the Black Jews. There is a marked racial difference between the two. The Blacks were originally
the slaves of the Whites as is shown by their historical documents. It is not known when the
Whites came to India. Some think that they fled there during the Jewish exile. More likely
they came upon the dispersion during the first century of our era. The purity of their blood
and the remarkable fairness of their complexion indicate that the settlement has been from
time to time reenforced from northwestern countries. They are an exceedingly conservative people;
and in their two synagogues, they conduct their worship perhaps more like the Jews of twenty
centuries ago than do any other representatives of that race today. The day-school connected
with the White Synagogue closely resembles the little school which our Lord attended at Nazareth.

(b) Mohammedanism.

About one-fifth of the whole population of that land is connected with the religion of the
great prophet of Arabia. This is a number largely in excess of the whole Mohammedan population
of Turkey. It is very suggestive that this faith finds larger growth under the peaceable protection
of the Indian, than under the semi-barbarism of the Moslem, government.

This religion was carried into India in 711 A. D. at the point of the sword; and its establishment
and success for centuries was owing to the same method. This community is not evenly distributed
all over India; for, more than one-third of it is found in Bengal alone, where it furnishes
the majority of the population. More than one-half of the adherents of this faith in India
are converts from Hinduism. These were gathered in former centuries when the Mohammedan power
was dominant, and when to be a member of any other faith than Islam was regarded as a disability.
The Mohammedans of the country are, on the whole, physically more sturdy and vigorous than
their neighbours. Government, in its treatment of the people, has to conciliate and regard
with favour this class more than the Hindus who are four times their number. They possess a
great deal of religious bigotry which is intrenched behind their dense ignorance. There is
a no more ignorant element than this in the population of India; only six per cent. of the
men are able to read and hardly any of the women; and they seem, even today, to have a positive
aversion to the schoolhouse. Mohammedanism had, during the days of its dominance, considerable
influence in the land; but it did very little to improve the material, moral or religious condition
of the people; and it is a significant fact that, comparing today the adherents of Islam in
India, with those of Hinduism, the latter are found not inferior in life, morals and aspirations
to the followers of the prophet.

The converts gathered from Mohammedanism by Christianity are few, though not so few as ordinarily
represented. In North India encouraging success has been achieved by missions for this class.
But in South India, where their numbers are fewer, efforts in their behalf have not been so
well organised and have produced smaller results. It is a hard task to reach and to move this
class, owing not only to the important truth of monotheism, which they hold with great enthusiasm,
but also because of the supreme ignorance which blinds them equally to the weakness of their
own, and to the excellence of the Christian, faith.

(c) Parseeism.

This faith has had adherents in India for eleven centuries. Driven out by Mohammedanism from
their home in Persia, the Parsees found refuge in India. There are only 100,000 of these followers
of Zoroaster in the world. 90,000 of them are in India; and nearly all of these reside in Bombay
and its vicinity. Their faith, Zoroastrianism, is the purest of ethnic religions. It has preserved
its ancient integrity and high tone much better than its sister faith, Brahmanism. Among the
members of this religion are found men possessed of great enterprise, much wealth, the spirit
of progress and of philanthropy and culture. They give high honour and position to their women,
and in all matters of civilization are considerably in advance of even the best class of Hindus.

This religion, though from the same source with Brahmanism, has fundamental differences of
doctrine from that faith. None is more marked or significant than its Dualism as contrasted
with the Pantheism of its sister faith. The problem of the origin of evil has found these two
diverse interpretations and these have had a large influence in shaping the characters, respectively,
of these two great ethnic religions.

Besides the far-off common source of these two religions, indicated by the earliest names and
character of their deities, there is hardly any bond of fellowship in doctrine, worship or
observance between the fire worshipping Parsee and the Hindu idolater. And though these Parsees
have, for more than a millennium, made India their home, they have kept themselves apart from
the people of the land and are still as truly foreigners in the land of their adoption as are
the English residents.

(d) Buddhism.

This religion is a child of India; its founder, Gautama, was the product of that land, and,
next to our Lord Himself, is the greatest among the founders of religions. Buddhism arose as
a reaction, twenty-five centuries ago, against the excesses of Brahmanism. It flourished wonderfully
for a few centuries, and at the time when Christ was on earth, had gained supremacy over the
old faith and had become the State religion in India. Owing to the Brahmanic revival, in the
eighth century of our era, Buddhism was in its turn, driven out of the land, and has found
refuge in Ceylon and in more eastern countries from that time until the present. Since then
it has been almost entirely without followers in India proper. Of the British India possessions
Burma is the only place where it is the popular faith today.

Still it is not without much influence in the land of its birth. For, Brahmanism overcame its
rival faith in India only by adopting some of its most fundamental contentions and teachings.
Indeed, modern Hinduism is largely a blending of the Brahmanism of old with its supplanter,
Buddhism. The abundant sacrifices which Brahmanism offered were entirely abolished in deference
to Buddhistic sensibilities. The doctrine of transmigration, through Buddhism, received new
emphasis; and kindness to all living creatures was extolled to a supreme virtue. As a climax
to this attitude of conciliation Hinduism finally adopted the Buddha as the ninth incarnation
of Vishnu. Thus, by the irony of history, Gautama, the Buddha, found a place in the pantheon
of the religion which he gave his life to overthrow; and today many of the leading aspects
of the life and teaching of the Hindus may be traced, either in source or in emphasis, to his
religion.

(e) Jainism.

This religion is an offshoot, or the India remnant, of Buddhism. It perhaps represents that
element among the followers of the Buddha who declined to be absorbed into the revived and
transformed Brahmanic faith. Through the many centuries of their existence as a sect they have
spurned every approach of the Brahmans and have largely stood for Buddhistic teaching and observances.
They have differed little from Buddhists in their beliefs; for they deny the authority of the
Hindu Vedas, disregard sacrifices, cultivate a high morality, believe strongly in transmigration
and reverence life in all its forms. And yet, strangely enough, many of the priests of their
temples are Brahmans and they place Hindu idols close to their shrines. They differ from the
Buddhists chiefly in their objects of worship and in their ritual. They have a mythology of
their own—a mythology of saints rather than of gods. These saints, or “Jaina,” (the “victorious
ones”—those who have attained perfection through self-victory and discipline) are worshipped,
and furnish an inspiration to all the devotees of that faith.

The Jains, like the Parsees, are found mostly in Bombay and are a wealthy community, usually
engaged in banking and commerce. They are noted for their charity, and their philanthropy is
largely directed towards helping the poor among them and for maintaining hospitals for animals.

(f) Sikhism.

This religion, if we may so denominate it, was founded by Nanak Shah in the fifteenth century.
Nanak Shah was apparently an admirer, if not a follower, of Kabir, the Hindu reformer who established
a sect which was essentially a compromise between Hinduism and Mohammedanism. This is the chief
characteristic of Sikhism. It eschewed the polytheism and idolatry of Hinduism. It taught the
unity of the Godhead, abolished caste, and enforced a high type of morality. It has, however,
subsequently fallen under the blighting influence of surrounding Hinduism and has lost much
of its distinctive excellence. So that, according to the census report of 1891, “distinction
between Sikhs and the rest of the Brahmanic community is mainly ritualistic.... The only trustworthy
method of distinguishing this creed was to ask if the person in question repudiated the services
of the barber and the tobacconist; for the precepts most strictly enforced nowadays (by the
Sikhs) are that the hair of the head and face must never be cut, and that smoking is a habit
to be avoided.”

However manifestly the Sikh religion is going the common way of all the new faiths and religious
revolts of India—the way of reabsorption into Hinduism—it has done much to create and foster
a strong national feeling. Sikhs were cruelly persecuted by the then ruling Mohammedans. But
the overthrow of the Moghul Empire gave the Sikhs territorial power and they possessed the
only remaining political organization in the Punjab. So that, at the advent of the British,
the Sikhs were a mighty power to be dealt with. They became the great power of North India;
and during the Indian mutiny their loyalty to the British Raj was its salvation. At present
the Sikh nation, warlike and valiant as ever, furnishes, perhaps, the most stalwart and invincible
contingent for the Indian Army.

(g) Hinduism.

This is the religion of three-fourths of all the inhabitants of India and of nine-tenths of
all those who are there reached by missionaries.

What is Hinduism? It is a mixture of Brahmanism, Buddhism and Devil-worship. As we have seen,
the supplanting faith of Buddha was finally absorbed, so far as India was concerned, into the
old faith. When, later on, the Brahmans moved towards the southern part of the peninsula they
entered the region occupied by, and largely given over to, demonolatry. According to its wont
Brahmanism, as modified by Buddhism, sought not to overthrow the primitive cult of the people,
but to absorb it. Thus, in South India today, more than three-fourths of the people are devil
worshippers. And yet, with their demons, they have been accepted into the higher faith of the
Aryan; and, according to their mood and preference, give themselves to the worship of Hindu
gods or village demons. Worshipping in pure Hindu temples is to that people but a pastime,
a mere holiday diversion; while the appeasing of the demons at their village shrines and under
old trees in their hamlets is the most serious concern of their life. And yet all of them are
regarded, and rightly regarded, as Hindus. Indeed, in the Hinduism of today, especially as
found in South India, can be found living amicably together and without any apparent sense
of incongruity or conflict the lowest type of fetishism, an ardent devil-worship, an engrossing
ceremonialism, a worship of the higher Brahmanical deities, a thoroughgoing pantheism and a
pure theism. I have witnessed in our district, side by side, a hideous fetish, a gross idol
of a local demon, an image of Vishnu who is the best of Brahmanical gods, while in an adjacent
hamlet lived families who belonged to none of these cults but who gave themselves to a belief
in, and practice of, a vague theism which is farther removed from the fetishism of their neighbours
than is their religion from the highest type of Christian teaching.

Thus Hinduism may be viewed as an immense cloth of many colours; which colours have been patched
together without any reference to harmony or consistency. In other words, that religion is
a big mass of mutually inconsistent and undigested beliefs, practices and ceremonies. It has
not only mutually antagonistic philosophies, it has also three different ways of salvation,
330,000,000 gods and as many laws and customs which, though binding as the laws of the Medes
and Persians, are nevertheless, absolutely wanting in consistency and in unity of purpose and
teaching. In the words of Sir Alfred Lyall,—“The general character of Indian religion is that
it is unlimited and comprehensive, up to the point of confusion; it is a boundless sea of divine
beliefs and practices; it encourages the worship of innumerable gods by an infinite variety
of rites; it permits every doctrine to be taught, every kind of mystery to be imagined, any
sort of theory to be held as to the inner nature and visible operation of the divine power.”

It has been the wont of Brahmanism not to directly antagonize and overthrow the old and the
opposing cults, but rather to absorb them. Note here its fundamental contrast with Christianity.
It meets its rival with a smile of appreciation, then seeks to fraternize with it, after which
it approves and appropriates and finally absorbs it.

In the Madura District of South India, where I have lived, the Brahmans, upon their first arrival,
found all the people given to the worship of their village demons. They said to them, practically,—“We
do not wish to deprive you of your devil shrines and images and worship. We will take the leading
demons which you worship and marry them to our great gods and then give to them a place in
our pantheon and a part in our worship. Come ye also with them and we will welcome you into
our temples and faith.” Thus “Meenatchi,” the old and the principal demoness of the primitive
cult of that region, was married to the great god Siva and became the presiding goddess of
the great Hindu temple of Madura; and all her old worshippers followed her into the new faith
of Hinduism. So all those people are Hindus today. And yet they have not abated one jot of
their interest in and practice of their demonolatry.

That which may be regarded as the more strictly Brahmanical development and manifestation of
Hinduism is divided, at present, into two great cults. These are Saivism, or the worship of
Siva, and Vaishnavism, or the worship of Vishnu. These two cults, while not mutually antagonistic,
are nevertheless entirely separate—their devotees, respectively, being satisfied with their
own god and his incarnation and manifestations.

The first god of the Hindu triad (Brahma, Vishnu and Siva)—has practically no shrines among
Hindus today. His worship has been largely transferred to his so-called sons, the Brahmans;
and Siva has, in the main, absorbed all his functions as creator. As it is only Vishnu, the
preserver, and Siva, the destroyer and recreator that have anything to do with men, the Hindus
devote themselves to these two only. Siva is the “great god,” the austere and terrible one
whom the people fear. He is known chiefly through his phallic emblem, the linga, which emphasizes
his creative activity. Vishnu is the benign god who has resorted to many incarnations whereby
he might free the world of demons who were worrying and destroying our race. Siva has many
manifestations; Vishnu alone has “descents” or incarnations, some of which were in brute, and
some in human, form.

These two cults obtain universally throughout India. Vaishnavism (the worship of Vishnu) has
many popular sects which wield extensive influence throughout the country. The one established
by Vallabha-Swami, in the sixteenth century, is a worship of Krishna and is given to the indulgence
of the passions and is characterised by gross licentiousness.

The sect founded by Chaitanya in the fourteenth century is one of the most celebrated, and
is very popular in Bengal. It subordinates everything to faith (bhakti) even making this more
important than caste. Contemplation, rather than ritual, was Chaitanya’s pathway to salvation
and he gave supreme value to the virtue of obedience to the “guru” or religious guide.

In South India the cult of the religious reformer, Ramanuja, who flourished in the twelfth
century, has extensive popularity. He was a man of great thought, and his special type of Vedantic
philosophy is much in vogue today. He proclaimed the unity of God under the name of Vishnu.
He received converts from every caste. It is an interesting fact that nearly all, in the long
list of religious reformers in India, took a position of hostility to the caste system. But
it is also significant that none of these reform movements has persisted through the centuries
in that attitude, but has fallen into line with orthodox Hinduism in absolute submission to
the caste demon.

“Sakti” worship has also attained great influence and extensive predominance in many parts
of India. This is the worship of the Sakti or the female half of the great deities of the land.
The Saktar preëminently worship Kali, the goddess of blood, and the other consorts of Siva.
It is a worship of power (“Sakti” means energy or power), and usually power of the maleficent
type. It is perhaps the lowest form of Hinduism and easily lends itself to a gratification
of the lowest passions of men. This tantric cult (the tantras are the sacred books of the Saktar)
is the only one in modern Hinduism which indulges in bloody sacrifices—Kali and her sisters
being satisfied by blood as by nothing else. This attests the non-Aryan origin and character
of this worship, inasmuch as Brahmanism, since the days of Buddha, abjures all bloody sacrifice.

Let it not be supposed, however, from the above remarks, about the multiform and self-contradictory
character of the amorphous thing called Hinduism, that it is therefore impossible for us to
understand and measure its nature and power. For Brahmanism, through all ages, has not been
without a definite tendency, an underlying philosophy and pervasive fundamental beliefs. It
is indeed more a congeries of faiths than a simple religion, like Christianity. And yet, amid
all its hosts of contradictions and ways of salvation and sects and cults there have sounded,
as a diapason through all the centuries, the fundamental teachings of Vedantism. A few doctrines
such as pantheism, transmigration, “karma,” “bhakti” and final absorption into the Supreme
Soul are all but universally held by the people of all sects and divisions, however much at
variance with these their peculiar beliefs may seem to be.

The prominent staple of Hindu religious thinking in all ages has doubtless been Vedantism—that
subtle form of pantheism which has charmed and bewildered not a few of the great minds of the
Occident also. The paramount influence of this philosophy upon all religious thought and life
in India is unmistakable today, as it has been through the centuries.

By a study of these one may easily reach the heart of Hindus and of Hinduism and can weigh
and measure the forces which enter into their religious life and thinking, and can compare
them with the teachings and institutions of Christianity.

This study will bring a twofold blessing to Christians of the West, especially to missionaries
who have given themselves to the regeneration of India. It will give them a larger degree of
respect for that great people of the East and a new appreciation for Hindu thought and religious
speculation.

I argue for a study of those teachings which, though hoary with age, are today all-important
as the foundation upon which the many-aisled temple of Hinduism is built and (if I may change
the figure) as the cement which binds the whole structure together.

A few years ago it was generally thought that Brahmanism was little else than the insane ravings
of well-meaning, but unguided, or, worse still, misguided, denizens of darkness; the whole
literature was considered a mass of intellectual and moral rubbish. How much the verdict of
Western scholars upon this subject has changed during the last quarter of a century I need
not mention. All men who have investigated the subject give today unstinted praise to the heart
and intellect of those sages who produced much of the ancient religious literature of India.
Nowhere else, perhaps, do we meet with an equal wealth of fine sentences.” Of their intellectual
acumen Dr. Matheson says: “It is not too much to say that the mind of the West, with all its
undoubted impulses towards the progress of humanity, has never exhibited such an intense amount
of intellectual force as is to be found in the religious speculations of India.... These have
been the cradle of all Western speculations; and wheresoever the European mind has risen into
heights of philosophy, it has done so because the Brahman has been the pioneer. There is no
intellectual problem in the West which had not its earliest discussion in the East; and there
is no modern solution of that problem which will not be found anticipated in the East.” These
words of the Scotch divine are doubtless strong; too strong, I think. And yet they may be serviceable,
if they warn us against that proneness to depreciate the intellectual value and serious purpose
of the religious books of that land. It is worse than useless to confidently descant upon the
errors, inconsistencies, the follies and absurdities of these writings without acknowledging
at the same time the profound thought, the deep spiritual yearning and the sublime poetic beauty,
which characterize some portions.

In this connection the question of the origin of Hinduism is important.

It was formerly laid down as a postulate of the Christian’s belief that Hinduism is of the
devil; and that, coming from below, it must be shunned as a study and denounced root and branch
as a thing purely satanic. This theory has entirely given way to a more rational belief. The
question whether the truths of Hinduism, with those of other ethnic religions, have filtered
down from some primitive revelation and are the relics of a vanishing faith, divinely communicated
to some of the earliest members of our race; or whether God has directly, from time to time,
guided the thoughts and answered the deep yearnings of the soul of the Indo-Aryan, is one which
is still discussed. But modern scholarship is practically of one voice in maintaining that
God hath not left Himself without witness among the many nations of the earth,—a witness that
has indeed been comparatively feeble—a revelation that is dim and starlike as compared with
the noonday brightness of the Sun of Righteousness in the Christian religion.

This study of Hinduism will also lead us to realize the important truth of the many points
of contact between that faith and our own. A knowledge of their sympathies cannot be of less
importance than that of their antipathies. And this knowledge is indispensable to the Christian
worker in India as it gives a new and a most direct way of approach to the Hindu heart, and
a fresh and all-potent argument with them in behalf of Christianity.

This process also best illustrates the method and Spirit of Christ. Dr. Robson aptly remarks
that “while no religion has done more to overthrow other religions than Christianity, no religious
teacher has said less against other religions than Christ. We have from Him only one short
saying condemning the Gentiles’ aim in life, but not even one reflecting on the gods they believed
in, or the worship they paid them. Was not this because He came not to destroy but to fulfill?”

I can refer to only a few of these common points and belief in the two faiths.

(a) Incarnation.

These are the only two faiths which have exalted, to primal importance, this doctrine. In Christianity
it is basal, and in later Brahmanism, or Hinduism, it has overshadowed nearly every other teaching.
In a sense the all-pervasive pantheism of Brahmanism made a certain form of incarnation a necessity
from the earliest days. The ancient Aryans could not rest satisfied with the Unknown and the
Absolute of their Vedantism; so they speedily began to erect for their evergrowing pantheon
an endless procession of emanations. But it was, probably, the phenomenal success of Gautama,
and especially the posthumous influence of his life and example, that opened the eyes of the
Brahmans and suggested to them the supreme need of an avatar (“descent”), for the popularizing
of their faith. And thus originated that vast system of descents, or incarnations, which have
multiplied so greatly and developed so grotesquely all over the land. The common ground furnished
by this doctrine to the two faiths is not adequately appreciated. This truth of incarnation,
in its fundamental doctrinal bearing upon Hinduism, and in the strengthening of its hold, even
until the present, upon the popular imagination and affection, should not go for nought in
the mind of Christian critics, because of the content of the multitudinous descents, which
is mostly grotesque, debasing and repulsive. They forget that the Christian doctrine of incarnation
furnishes, perhaps, the best leverage with which the Christian missionary is to overturn the
faith of that people, simply because the doctrine itself has been so popularized, even if debased,
in India for many centuries. Christ should be none the less, yea the more, welcome to that
land because the most popular god of the Hindu pantheon (Krishna) is also the leading incarnation
of Vishnu.

(b) Vicarious Atonement.

In Christianity this is second in importance only to the doctrine of incarnation. In Brahmanism
also it has maintained, from the first, a position of cardinal importance. In pre-Buddhistic
days this found expression in sacrifices that were probably more numerous and more precious
than those offered by any other people. This is partly shown by the fact that words used for
sacrifice are more numerous in the Sanskrit than even in the Hebrew language. It is true that
their idea of sacrifice, both as to its import and object, was different from ours or from
that of the Israelites; and indeed their own ideas also varied at different times. Under the
influence of Buddhism, sacrifice, as such, was practically abandoned; but the idea of atonement
for sin, which was underlying them, they practically carried over into the doctrine of transmigration.
For, however stiffly they contend that, through metempsychosis, the doctrine of karma is realized
and every soul atones for its own sin, it nevertheless remains true that the element of consciousness
separates the person who sinned from him who suffers; and one becomes the involuntary atoner
and the other the atoned for.

(c) Spirituality.

It may, to some, seem absurd to bring the two faiths into anything but the relationship of
contrast in this particular, when it is remembered that we are confronted daily by a Hinduism
which is as grossly formal, materialistic and sensual as any religion known in any land. But
it is unnecessary to remind us of the fact that the literature of the faith of this people
is, in some respects, far removed from the low life and ritual of the present day; and in no
greater respect than in this which we are now considering. All students recognize in many writings,
vedic and post-vedic, profound seriousness and a sometimes strange depth of spiritual apprehension
coupled with an other-worldliness which, to the western mind, seems absurdly impractical. Indeed,
the naturally mystical bent of the Hindu mind has been regarded, and, doubtless, rightly regarded,
as one of the chief obstacles to a true and easy understanding of much that is in their sacred
writings by the too practical Westerner. We should not be blind to the lofty height of spiritual
thought which we occasionally, and the deep spiritual yearning which we frequently, are permitted
to witness in their books. In evidence of this we need only to refer to the powerful hold which
the yoga system of philosophy and life has upon them. An intense meditativeness, a devotional
ecstasy and an insight of true heavenly wisdom is the ideal of life to which the Hindu has
been called from time very remote.

(d) Eschatology.

In Hinduism, as in Christianity, man is directed to look to a judgment-seat and a system of
rewards and punishments in the world to come. While this doctrine again, in its development
and detail, differs essentially from that of the Christian faith, it is well to call attention
to it as a point of contact. It breathes the spirit of karma, which, in its retributive power,
has been compared by some to the doctrine of heredity, and by others, to that of fate. Karma
demands the full future fruition of every act done in the body; and many re-births, with intervals
of keener suffering and bliss in numerous hells and heavens, are the countless steps in the
doleful fugue of emancipation—a process which is enough to appall any but the patient, stolid
soul of a Hindu. And yet this weary detail of a very long and sisyphean effort to shake off
this mortal coil and to enter into rest is worthy of the missionary’s attention, as it represents,
perhaps, the most elaborate system of eschatology outside of the New Testament. It is also
ethical in its character, and in its fundamental principles has chords which harmonize with
those of the Christian doctrine.

(e) The Doctrine of Faith.

This doctrine maintains that, by devotion to a personal god, salvation is achieved. This idea
separates this doctrine from, and apparently antagonizes, the prevailing philosophy of the
land—Vedantism. This cult of Bhakti is connected with Krishnaolatry, which is the worship of
the most unworthy and licentious god of the Hindu pantheon.

Of Vaishnavism, or the worship of Vishnu, in which the bhakti, or faith, doctrine prevails,
Sir Monier Williams remarks:—“Notwithstanding the gross polytheistic superstitions and hideous
idolatry to which it gives rise, it is the only Hindu system worthy of being called a religion.
At all events it must be admitted that it has more common ground with Christianity than any
other form of non-Christian faiths.” The basal truth of bhakti—that of supreme attachment to,
or faith in, a personal god—could not fail of rousing within the devout lofty and stirring
emotion. Bhaktar, i.e., those who have given themselves absolutely to this doctrine and make
it the motive and inspiration of their lives, are oblivious to all other bonds, abjuring among
themselves even caste and all its demands, and proclaiming the true oneness of the brotherhood
of the faith among all the devotees of the same god.

Thus we have today a large and vigorous class of Hindus who have subordinated every doctrine
and practice of their religion to that of faith, or bhakti. I believe, with not a few illustrious
scholars, that this doctrine traces its origin to Christianity. Like everything else which
Hinduism had absorbed, it has been considerably transmuted in the process. It has been necessarily
and greatly affected and degraded by the character of the gods who have been its objects. It
has been debased by contact with idolatry and error, with superstition and sensuality. And
yet we trace its lineaments to its lofty, divine origin, and hesitate not to say that it furnishes
a common ground of a fundamental truth of which Christian missionaries have not yet sufficiently
availed themselves in their work for this people.

Hindus have also done not a little thinking in the elaboration of the doctrine of salvation.
In their discussion as to the relative potency of divine grace and human agency in the salvation
of man they became divided into two antagonistic schools, corresponding, very closely, to the
Calvinistic and Arminian, among Christians—the Tengaliar maintaining the “cat theory” and the
Vadagaliar the “monkey theory”; so called because one party holds that, just as the cat saves
her kitten by seizing and carrying it away bodily, so God seizes and saves man without his
own effort. This is the doctrine of absolute grace. The other party insists that the relation
of the young monkey to its mother, whereby its rescue from trouble depends upon its own grasp,
best represents the process of salvation in which man’s coöperation is necessary.

They have also developed the doctrine of growth in grace sometimes in a very instructive way.

In like manner they teach that, for the attainment of beatitude, it is necessary to pass through
five stages—(1) that of sānti, quiet repose or calm and contemplative piety; (2) that of dāsya,
the slave state—the surrender of the whole will to God; (3) that of sakhya, or friendship;
(4) that of vātsalya, or filial affection; and (5) that of mādhurya, or supreme, all-absorbing
love.

I must refer briefly to only one other illustration of the probable influence of our religion
upon the faith of India, and that is in its teaching on eschatology. The illustration is drawn
from the tenth incarnation, Kalki avatār, of Vishnu. This incarnation is to take place hereafter,
when Vishnu will come, at the close of the present Kali yuga, or iron age, and put an end to
these growing evil times, destroying with them all the wicked and ushering in the new era of
righteousness (Satya yuga) upon the earth. For this great work of the restoration and the renovation
of all creation, he is to come seated upon a white horse with a drawn sword, blazing like a
comet. Hindus at present look forward to this new incarnation as their future deliverer, when
the sorrows and the depravity of this present, shall be swallowed up in the glories and joys
of the future, age. The striking thing about this teaching is not the hope which it inculcates
for the future; for that is practically a part of the Hindu conception of the succession of
the ages of their time system. According to this the present era must yield to the coming good
yuga, which must, in its turn, give way to the ages of lesser good and of evil, which again
will go and come in their ever-changing cycle. What seems remarkable is the form in which this
idea is here clothed. The coming of the Deliverer upon a Kalki—a white horse—with his great
message of universal destruction and deliverance, brings directly to our memory the Bible prophecy
of Rev. 6:2; 19:11-16, and also brings us into touch with the belief of many Christians today
as to the appearance and the work of the Son of Man at the great day of His Second Coming.

The question arises as to how this avatar originated. It evidently seems to be an afterthought
and of no ancient date among the series of Vishnu’s descents. And following the ninth, or Buddha,
avatar, which was clearly intended as a bait to Buddhists, and as a frank and full compromise
with that hitherto supplanting and hostile faith, it seems natural to suppose that this tenth
also came in the same way and with the same spirit as a palm leaf to another religion, even
our own, whose prophetic words about the second coming of Christ could be so easily appropriated
and so harmlessly adopted into the Hindu system. It thus introduced into their faith an element
of future glory and triumph which the religion had not formerly possessed. Indeed this very
element of aggression and conquest is one of the signs of its Western origin and Christian source.

                               Chapter III.

HINDUISM AND CHRISTIANITY CONTRASTED.

In the previous chapter I have endeavoured to show and emphasize the teachings common to Christianity
and Hinduism.

But it must not be forgotten that if their consonances are neither few nor unimportant their
dissonances are far more numerous and fundamental. They meet us at almost every point of our
investigation and impress us with a sense of a vast contrast.

We will now give ourselves to a brief study of these divergences.

The two faiths differ essentially.

1. In their Initial Conceptions.

Their starting points are almost antipodal. This will seem evident when we study their views:

(a) In reference to religion itself. Christianity is briefly and beautifully explained by its
Founder (Luke 15) as a divine method of seeking and saving the lost. It is the expression of
the Father’s love yearning for the return, and seeking the complete salvation, of the son.
It is primarily and pervasively a “Thus saith the Lord”—a revelation from God manward. Hinduism
on the other hand has been the embodiment of man’s aspirations after God. Wonderfully pathetic,
beautiful and elevating these aspirations have been at times; and doubtless guided at points
by Him whom they so ardently sought. They perhaps represent the highest reach of the soul in
its self-propelled flight towards its Maker. It is true that orthodox Hindus variously describe
the Vedas as eternal, as a direct emanation from Brahma and as a divine entity in themselves.
They constitute the “Sruti”—“the directly heard” message of God to man. But the authors of
the Upanishads, which are a part of Sruti, absolve man from the necessity of accepting the
four Vedas and propound a way of salvation entirely separate from, and independent of, vedic
prayers and ritual. The direct influence of the Vedas upon religious life and ritual in India
today is practically nil; while that of the Upanishads, which are the fons et origo of the
all-potent philosophy, is felt in every Hindu life, however humble.

This aspect of the two faiths is not unexpected when we remember:

(b) Their very dissimilar conceptions of God. The monotheism of the one and the pantheism of
the other are clear and uncompromising. They have stood for many centuries as representatives,
to the world, of these very dissimilar beliefs. Christianity inherited from Judaism its passion
for monotheism, and brings the “God of Israel” very near to our race as the infinitely loving
Father. It has not only emphasized His personality but reveals, with incomparable power and
tenderness, His supreme interest in our race and His loving purpose concerning it.

On the other hand Hinduism derived its highest wisdom and deepest convictions concerning the
Divine Being from the ancient rishis through the Upanishads. There they accepted, once for
all, the doctrine of the Brahm (neuter)—the one passionless, immovable, unsearchable, ineffable
Being who, without a second, stands as the source and embodiment of all real being.

Barth truly remarks that “this is the most imposing and subtle of the systems of ontology yet
known in the history of philosophy.” This inscrutable Being is the only real existence, all
else being illusion projected by ignorance. This doctrine of identity or nonduality (advaitha)
lies at the foundation of all their religious thinking. This Being which is devoid of qualities
(nirguna), because incomprehensible to man, can be of no comfort to him. In this respect the
Hindu is an agnostic of a profound type.

For this mystical philosophy one word of praise is eminently due. It is not to be confounded
with that species of Western pantheism which is rank materialism—making God and the material
universe convertible terms. Sir William Jones emphasized this difference—the difference between
a system which, in all that it sees, sees God alone, and that which acknowledges no God beyond
what it sees. One is the bulwark of materialism; the other its most uncompromising enemy. Whatever
the defects of this philosophy of the Upanishads it must be confessed to be deeply spiritual.

And yet in this very effort to conserve the spiritual and transcendental character of Brâhm
the Aryan sage has covered Him with the dark robe of mysticism and pushed Him into a far off
realm beyond human ken.

So that the only intimations which man has of Him are confessedly false projection of ignorance.
For all practical purposes this hypothetical deity—for the very existence of Brâhm is only
assumed as a working hypothesis by the theosophist—is a nonentity to the worshipper. How can
a being lend itself to a devout soul in worship when it is rigidly devoid of every quality
that can inspire or attract the soul? This very fact has led the ordinary Hindu to seek and
develop something else as an object of his devotion. Hence the polytheism of Brahmanism. Let
it not be supposed that there is any antagonism between their pantheism and their polytheism.
One is the natural offspring of the other. The numberless gods which today are supposed to
preside over the destiny of the people, are but emanations, the so-called “play” of Brâhm.
Properly speaking they are neither supreme nor possessed of truly divine attributes. Even the
Hindu Triad—Brahma (masculine gender), Vishnu and Siva—are but manifestations of the delight
of the eternal Soul to invest itself with qualities (guna). These three gods are no more real
existences than are the myriad other children of illusion (maya) and ignorance (avidya) which
constitute the universe. And as they had their existence, so will they find their dissolution,
in the fiat of the Supreme Soul. India finds polytheism no more satisfying than it does pantheism.
There is no more assurance of comfort in worshipping 330,000,000 gods, whose multitude not
only bewilders but also carries in itself refutation to the claim of any one to be supreme,
than there is in the yearning after an absolute, ineffable Being which cruelly evades human
thought and definition. It is no wonder therefore that the growth of the Hindu pantheon is
constant, and both follows, and bears testimony to, the craving of the human soul for a God
who can satisfy its wants and realize its deepest longings.

(c) Their theories of the universe are also divergent. According to the Bible the outer world
is the creation, by God, out of nothing. To the Brahman of all times the idea of pure creation
has seemed absurd. Ex nihilo nihil fit is an axiom of all their philosophies. Whether it be
the Vedantin who tells us that the material universe is the result of Brâhm invested with illusion,
or the Sankya philosopher who attributes it to prakriti—the power of nature; or the Veisashika
sage who traces it to eternal atoms; they all practically posit that it is eternal.

Of course the Christian doctrine of creation from nothing does not, as the Hindu too often
assumes, maintain that the universe is a result without a cause; for it teaches that God Himself,
by the exercise of His sovereign will and omnipotence, is an all-adequate cause to all created
things.

If the Vedantin claims that creation is impossible, how can he at the same time believe that
ideas have from time to time sprung up in the mind of Brâhm, which ideas themselves have put
on illusion and appear to human ignorance as the universe? It is, to say the least, no easier
for him, with his conception of Brâhm, to account for the origin of such ideas than it is for
the Christian to trace the source of the material universe to an all-wise and omnipotent God.
Nor does the Sankya philosopher, by practically denying God and positing the eternal existence
of souls and prakriti, remove half the difficulties that he creates.

(d) Again, the teachings of the two faiths concerning man are no less divergent. In the Bible
man is represented as a son of God. He is fallen indeed, but with a trace, even in his degradation,
of his Father’s lineaments. We follow him in his willful rebellion against his Father; he plunges
into the lowest depths of sin. But we still recognise in him the promise of infinite and eternal
possibilities of spiritual expansion and happiness. Indeed we find at work a divinely benevolent
scheme through which he is to be ultimately exalted to heavenly places in Christ Jesus and
made the heir of infinite bliss.

On the other hand, Hindu Shastras represent man as mere illusion—the poor plaything of the
absolute One. For man to assume and to declare his own real existence is, they say, but the
raving of his ignorance (avidya). To the practical Western mind it seems almost impossible
that a philosopher should be so lost in his philosophy as to aver that he, the thinker and
father of his philosophy, has no real existence—is only illusion, concerning which real existence
can only be assumed for practical purposes. What must be said of the philosophy begotten by
such an illusive being? Shall it not also be doomed to vanish with him into the nothingness
whence he came and which he now really is, if he only knew it? Sir Monier Williams aptly remarks,—“Common
sense tells an Englishman that he really exists himself and that everything he sees around
him really exists also. He cannot abandon these two primary convictions. Not so the Hindu Vedantist.
Dualism is his bugbear, and common sense, when it maintains any kind of real duality, either
the separate independent existence of a man’s own spirit and of God’s spirit, or of spirit
and matter, is guilty of gross deception.”

Another conception regards the human soul (jivatma) as a part of the Supreme Soul. This theory
adds small comfort or dignity to it when we remember that this whole of which it is declared
a part is an intangible, unattractive Being—devoid of all qualities (nirguna). If the soul
existed from eternity as a part of the divine Soul and will ultimately resume that interrupted
existence, what value, ethical or otherwise, can be attached to that bondage of manhood which
was thrust upon the soul (or was it voluntarily assumed?)? This part of deity called individual
soul certainly cannot be improved by its human conditions; and the question is not—“How soon
can I pass through this slough of despond,” but, “why was I thrust into it at all? Was it a
mere sacred whim (tiruvileiadal) of Brâhm?”

Moreover this view of human “self,” or soul, carries one out too far into the sea of transcendental
metaphysics to be of any practical use, religiously. We know something of man—this strange
compound of soul and body—and we are deeply interested in his history and destiny; the more
deeply because we are included in this category.

But who knows of the eternal soul—that part of the absolute—separate from human conditions
and apart from all experiences of men? Is it not simply the dream of the philosopher, a convenient
assumption to satisfy the needs of an impractical ontology? To magnify the soul apart from
human life, and to interpret human life as the self’s lowest degradation and something which
is to be shaken off as quickly as possible, can hardly be sound philosophy, and is certainly
bad theology. It simply reduces this life into an irremedial evil, with no moral significance
or spiritual value.

This leads us to the second point of contrast:—

2. Their Ultimate Aim or Goal.

What do these two religions promise to do for those who embrace them? The work which Christianity
proposes to itself is difficult and glorious. It takes fallen, sin-sodden, man and leads him
out into a new life of holiness; it opens out to him a long and broad vista of life with an
ever-enlarging, blissful, activity. Christ said that He came into the world that men might
have life and have it abundantly. He came not only to save the lost but also to develop all
the grand possibilities of the soul to their utmost, and to launch the human bark upon a voyage
of everlasting life, which means unceasing growth in all its noblest qualities, activities
and enjoyments.

Hindu philosophy and faith, on the other hand, unite in commanding that human endowments be
starved, qualities suppressed, activity of all kinds stayed, ambition and every other desire,
even the noblest and purest, quenched. All the essential elements of life itself are to be
mortified that the soul may, unhampered by its own entanglement, reach that consummation which
is supposed to be final. And what is it? Who can tell? The Aryan philosopher himself stands
mute in its presence. All that we can predicate of it is not life and happiness, according
to any standard of human experience known or imagined. The idea that the individual soul will
finally sink into and blend with the Absolute Being as a drop of water returns to and mingles
with its mother ocean may seem plausible to the philosopher; but of such an hypothetical existence
we know absolutely nothing and can expect nothing that would inspire hope and kindle ambition.

In Hinduism there are heavens many and not a few hells. But unlike the places of reward and
punishment connected with Christianity, they represent nothing final. They are more like the
purgatory of the Catholics, and represent only steps in the progress of the soul towards emancipation.

Concerning the general view of human life, its import and outcome, the two faiths are antipodal.
Christianity is brightly optimistic. The future of every Christian is to be as the sun shining
more and more until the perfect day. Unceasing progress and eternal expansion are held out
before him. His is an heritage that will abide and will resound in an ever increasing anthem
of praise throughout time and eternity. Nothing can occur hereafter to rob him of that crown
of glory which is the gift of God and which is to result in likeness to Him.

Hinduism, on the other hand, is essentially pessimistic. It teaches that human life is totally
and irremediably evil. Every power of the soul must be exercised in the endeavour to shake
off this terrible burden of separate human existence and escape all the conditions of this
life. That is the only relief possible. To the Hindu the question so often discussed in Christian
lands—“Is life worth living?”—has no interest, since it has but one answer possible. And even
if the Indian sage forgets his present conditions and pessimism long enough to gaze down the
long and dismal vista of numberless births to the final consummation (Sayujya)—the final union
with God—he finds in that nothing which the Christian does not discover in tenfold richness
and beauty in the Bible. To be partaker of the Divine Nature is a blessed reality to the Christian
without his forfeiting, in the least, the dignity of self-identity and the glory of separate
personal consciousness. To have the “life hid with Christ in God”; to be able triumphantly
to exclaim—“I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me”; to experience the blessedness and
power of abiding in Christ and to realize the answer to Christ’s own prayer to the Father—“that
they also may be in us”—all this is the joy and hope of the Christian in a manner and to a
degree utterly impossible to the Hindu whose union with the supreme spirit is the loss and
end of self, including all those faculties which are capable of enjoyment.

Looking from another standpoint, we perceive that the aim of the religion of Christ is the
banishing of sin from the life and the establishing of character. Sin is the dark background
of Christianity. It explains its origin and reveals its universality. Its whole concern is
with the emancipation of man from the presence and power of sin. To the Vedantin, on the other
hand, sin, in the Christian sense of it, is an impossibility. Where God is all and all is God
there can be no separate will to antagonize the divine will. Monism necessarily, in the last
analysis, carries every act and motive back to the supreme Will and establishes an all-inclusive
necessitarianism which is fatal to human freedom; and it therefore excludes sin as an act of
rebellion against God. Much is made of sin, so called, in the Hindu system, as we shall presently
see; but nowhere is more care needed than here that we may distinguish between ideas conveyed
by this word in these two faiths. In Christianity the ethical character of sin is emphasized.
It is described as a thing of moral obliquity and spiritual darkness. According to the Upanishads
the only defect of man is an intellectual one. He is in bondage to ignorance. Plato made ignorance
the chief source of moral evil and proposed philosophy as a remedy for the malady. The Vedantin
differs from the Greek philosopher only in his more absolute condemnation of (avidya) ignorance
as the mother of all human ills. Remove this—let a man attain unto a true knowledge of self,
of the fact that he has no real separate existence and is one with the Supreme Soul—and he
becomes thereby qualified for his emancipation and ends his long cycle of births. Moreover,
in the polytheism of the Puranas and in the laws and customs of Manu sin generally means only
ceremonial defilement and the violation of customs and usages.

Hinduism, therefore, has never addressed itself to the task of helping man as a sinner—of regenerating
his heart, of establishing within him that beautiful thing known in Christian lands and philosophies
as a well rounded, symmetrical and perfect character. For many reasons and in many ways it
has aimed at a very different consummation in man from that consistently sought by Christ and
His religion.

3. The Agency and Means Recognized and Appealed to by those Faiths Respectively.

By what power and instrumentality are the above ends to be sought and attained? They will be,
doubtless, quite as divergent as the aims themselves were found to be.

In Christianity God Himself is the agent who works out its scheme of salvation. He entered,
through infinite condescension, into human life and relations in the Incarnation. He wrought,
in the days of His flesh, the redemption of our race—a work which finds its climax in His atoning
death. In the person of the Holy Spirit He is working and bringing to full fruition, in the
hearts and lives of men, the redemption which He wrought.

Into this, man enters not as an efficient cause of his own redemption. He cannot atone for
his past, nor has he the assurance within himself for the future. Hence the atoning sacrifice
of Christ and the indwelling of the Spirit of God which becomes in him a source of peace, of
power and of hope. Yet, in this divine work, man is neither passive nor apathetic. In the exercise
of saving faith he not only appropriates the works and gifts of God but also enters into full
and active harmony and coöperation with God in his own regeneration and salvation. So that
the Apostle Paul aptly urges the Philippian Christians (Phil. 2:12) to “work out your own salvation
with fear and trembling; for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to work for His
good pleasure.”

How different is the picture presented to us by the Hindu Shastras of the means of human redemption—a
picture, however, consonant with the aims which they have set before themselves to accomplish
for man. The first and all-present fact of this faith is the terrible loneliness and isolation
of man in the great struggle of life. His destiny is in his own hands, and he must fight single-handed
against a thousand odds in the awful battle for emancipation.

Karma is the word used to express this thought which has possessed the Hindu mind from the
earliest days to the present. This word may be translated “works,” and means the acts by which
the soul determines its own destiny. In Vedic times the all-powerful works were sacrifice and
ritual. In the Upanishads they are meditation and self-mortification. Today they are ceremonial,
with works of charity, self-renunciation or religious mendicancy generally added.

In pre-Buddhistic days sacrifice abounded in Brahmanism; and it grew to such proportions that
the revolt headed by Gautama and incarnated in Buddhism became universal. But vicariousness
was largely wanting as an element in, and as a cause of, their sacrifices. They were rather
offered with a view to nourish the gods and as a means of acquiring power. He who sacrificed
a hundred horses was said to gain thereby even larger power than Indra himself possessed—a
power which enabled him to dethrone this god of the heavens. Such was the power said to inhere
in sacrifice that the gods themselves combined to prevent men from the practice lest they should
rise to larger power than themselves! With the triumph and subsequent absorption of Buddhism
into Brahmanism the latter abandoned its sacrifices and accepted the Buddhistic emphasis upon
Karma, and doomed every soul to the tread-mill of its own destiny. To every human word, deed
or thought, however insignificant, there is fruit which must be eaten by the soul.

It is claimed for this doctrine that it well emphasizes the conservation of moral force. Christianity
also conserves, to the last, moral force; not however by insisting upon man bearing himself
the whole burden, but by enabling him to cast the burden upon the Lord who graciously offers
to bear the load of human guilt belonging to every soul.

Another word in India which is synonymous with large power and merit is Yoga. It is inculcated
in the Yoga philosophy and is supposed to stand for a high mental discipline which speedily
qualifies one for absorption into the Deity. It is manifested in the form of abstract meditation
and austerity—an austerity embodied in asceticism and self-mortification. From early times
this method has been held high in honour, and today is universally esteemed as the most powerful
and speedy boat wherewith to cross the sullen stream of human existence. The grand object of
Yoga is to teach how to concentrate the mind—an object based upon the idea that the great and
sole need of man is not moral and spiritual regeneration, but more light, i.e., a clear, intellectual
apprehension of things. Not only is this basis of philosophy false in supposing that such intellectual
gymnastics can finally exalt and save a soul, it is also radically defective in its general
rules and practical results. No one who has studied the childish rules which are prescribed
to the Yogis, or has observed in India many of even the better type of Yogis can fail to be
impressed with the degradation to mind and morals which is indissolubly connected with it.
Barth’s observation on the processes of Yoga is eminently true. “Conscientiously observed,”
he says, “they can only issue in folly and idiocy; and it is, in fact, under the image of a
fool or an idiot that the wise man is often delineated for us in the Puranas for instance.”(9)

Meditation upon the Divine Being and upon self is a supreme duty inculcated by Christianity.
Here God is a Personality upon whom the mind can be centred and find rest and exaltation. The
self also is conceived as a being with a separate and infinitely high destiny marked out before
it. Concentrated thought, deep emotion and lofty purpose, in view of these objects, is supremely
profitable. But what is there left worthy of thought for the Vedantist Yogi when the Divine
Being is the unknowable and the Yogi himself the deluded child of (Maya) illusion and (avidya)
ignorance—those twin enemies to all true and worthy knowledge? It cannot be elevating to detach
the mind from things worldly and attach it to nothing!

Incarnation, as we have seen above, has in later times become a popular doctrine in India.
The avatars (“descents”) of members of the Hindu pantheon, especially of Vishnu, the second
member of the Triad, wield a large influence in the religious life of the masses. Yet the doctrines
should, by no means, be regarded as identical or even similar in Hinduism and Christianity.
It should be remembered that in Hinduism it is believed and magnified by those who also hold
the law of Karma as supreme. There is hardly a Vaishnavite and Krishnaolater who does not believe
firmly that his destiny is writ large upon his forehead—that nothing that this or any god may
do can affect his adrishta which is that felt but unseen power working out the Karma vivaka,
or fruition of works, done by him in former births. This belief directly antagonizes incarnation
from the Christian standpoint, where it appears as God’s mighty instrument of grace to man.
Not so from the Hindu standpoint. The incarnations of Vishnu are referred to in their Shastras
“as consequences of deeds which the god himself had performed. One was the fruit of sins he
had committed; another of a curse which had been pronounced upon him.” And yet they are doubtless
frequently referred to as undertaken with a view to benefit and help our race. If such was
their intention it is difficult to see how that benefit could be any other than racial and
temporary; for there is no intimation in any of them of its being a means for the spiritual
uplifting, or moral regeneration, of one human soul.

There is no finality of blessing supposed to be in any Hindu incarnation; and it would be sacrilege
to compare the character of any one of them with the wonderful incarnation of Jesus. It is
not so much that many of them appear as fish, fowl and beast, and as such are devoid of moral
aim and efficiency; not a few are immoral, some of them, like Krishna, representing the worst
type of sensuality and moral obliquity. Such examples, in the popular mythology of the land,
have done, and are doing, inexpressible harm to the people and the country. “Like God like
people”; and when the god is highly popular and conspicuously immoral the result will be correspondingly
great.

In connection with the doctrine of avatar has arisen the well-known bhakti marga—“the way of
faith.” Many believe that the latter was the source of the former and that both were affected
by Christian teaching. In any case they are closely connected. Among many this way of love
and devotion to individual gods has gained preëminence over the other two ways of salvation—knowledge
(gnana marga) and works (Karma-marga)—though it should not be forgotten that bhakti itself
is regarded as a work of merit and is by no means synonymous with Christian faith. Yet it must
be confessed, as we have seen above, that Hinduism comes nearer, at this point than at any
other, to touching the religion of Jesus.

The blindness of this faith is also a serious objection to it. To the bhaktan “faith is the
great thing.” It matters not how hideous, morally and spiritually, the object of faith may
be, bhakti will triumphantly vindicate itself in the ultimate salvation of the soul. “Repose
faith in the idols, in ceremonial observances, in ascetic performances, in all that you religiously
do, and blessing will rest upon you.” This is the bhaktan’s creed; it is essentially the teaching
of the “Divine Song”—Bhagavad-Gita. And it is this which has so powerfully helped the moral
and spiritual degeneracy of India during the past few centuries. Men have attached themselves
absolutely to gods whose mythology, detailed in the Puranas and Tantras, is a narrative of
lust and of moral crookedness, devotion to which can mean only moral contamination and spiritual
death. Such a faith, in its nature and results, can only be contrasted with a loving devotion
to the incomparably holy and lovely Jesus.

4. The Processes of These Two Religions.

In other words we inquire, in what manner do they propose to attain unto their respective ends?

Christianity brings man into the new, divine life through the narrow gate of a new birth. He
stands justified before God and, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, he begins that course
of spiritual development which steadily progresses towards perfection in truth and holiness.

In Hinduism metempsychosis is the great process. “As the embodied soul,” says the Bhagavad-Gita,
“moves swiftly on through boyhood, youth and age, so will it pass through other forms hereafter.”
This doctrine is universally regarded as the all-potent solvent of human ills and the process
which alone can lead to ultimate rest. In transmigration the soul is supposed to pass on from
body to body in its wearisome, dismal progress, towards emancipation. The bodies in which it
is incarcerated will be of all grades, according to the character of the life in the previous
births, from the august and divine body of a Brahman down to a tenement of inorganic, lifeless
rock. From ancient times this weary process of working out the law of Karma has seized upon
the imagination and wrought itself into the very being of the people of India; so that today
it is the universal way of salvation believed and taught by the Vedantin, accepted with assurance
by the idolater, and the one great bugbear in the mind of even the common coolie.

This doctrine has its roots in Vedantism and is an essential part of it. The Brahman theosophist
taught that all souls emanated from Brâhm and must return to their source along the way of
metempsychosis. All acts, words and thoughts find their exact reward in future births. If a
man steals a cow he shall be reborn as a crocodile or lizard; if grain, as a rat; if fruit,
as an ape. The murderer of a Brahman endures long-suffering in the several hells and is then
born again in the meanest bodies to atone for his crime. According to Manu the soul might pass
“through ten thousand millions” of births. The passageway to absorption is through Brahmanhood
only. Transmigration is the doom of all others.

The prevalence of this doctrine in India is one of the saddest facts connected with its life.
It is sombre and depressing in the extreme and robs the mind of a good portion of the small
comfort which the idea of absorption might otherwise bring to it. Though the doctrine has found
a footing among other nations at different periods in their history, nowhere else has it prevailed
so long and exercised such a mighty influence over high and low as it has in that land.

The doctrine is based upon a hypothetical identity of soul in different successive bodies—a
hypothesis which can never be proved, and which contradicts the universal consciousness. Until
that erratic Englishwoman, Mrs. Besant, appeared, no one claimed to possess the first intimation,
through consciousness or memory, of a previous existence in another body. Ancient rishis and
a few others were said by others to have possessed it. Strange, if such a re-incarnation were
a fact, that none has ever been assured of it by any other agent than the philosopher in his
search after truth. Stranger still that men in such countless millions should hang their whole
destiny upon so rotten a cord—so unethical a theory—as is here involved. Why should any moral
being be put through a course of discipline, or be punished, for a past of which he has no
knowledge? To inflict a punishment for any conduct or thought to which the memory does not
bear evidence, nor conscience furnish assent, nor the whole realm of conscious experience reveal
a trace, is both unethical and in violation of the deepest laws of being.

Nor does it appear how this process, as a method of discipline, can achieve what is expected
of it. It is maintained that, ultimately, all the myriads of separate souls will cross over
this terrible stream of human existence and reach the further shore of emancipation. But what
aptitude, or efficiency, there can be in metempsychosis itself to reach this end is not apparent.
That the soul should ultimately reach beatitude rather than absolute, irremedial, degradation
through this process is merely assumed, and that without adequate foundation in reason.

In view of the well-known power of sin and its tendency to settle down, through habit, into
a permanent type of character; in view of the well-attested scientific doctrine of heredity—a
doctrine which easily accounts for and explains every semblance of truth in transmigration—it
seems incredible that any soul in India could, through transmigration, finally emerge out of
the quicksand of sin and corruption which surround and overwhelm it, especially when it is
assumed that it has already passed through many births.

It should also be remembered that, at its basis, this doctrine has its face turned, with equal
repugnance, against all sorts of work. Desire of every kind, good as well as evil, is to be
suppressed inasmuch as it is the source of action, and action must bear its fruit, the eating
of which prolongs existence which, itself, is the burden to be removed. The question is not
how to become good and to overcome evil in life, but how to shake off all personality. And
this is accomplished, they say, by abandoning all action and suppressing all desire whatever.
How this can result in holiness and lofty character is not evident. It is true that a certain
sort of “good works” have large value in this process of emancipation. But quiescence rather
than character is the thing emphasized. Noble thoughts and aspirations are as fatal as are
the basest to immediate deliverance—they all disturb that equilibrium of the soul which ushers
it into its final rest. “The confinement of fetters is the same whether the chain is of gold
or of iron.”

It is doubtless true that this doctrine has some elements of truth, otherwise it could not
have survived and thriven as it has. It bears consistent testimony to the immortality of the
soul. It also teaches the important truth that the soul must receive the full reward of all
its deeds in a body. It is also, in a certain way, a response to that deep instinct of justice
which is a part of human nature. But these cannot atone for its fundamental defects and errors.
Some claim that its highest merit is that it is a powerful deterrent from sin and incentive
to virtue. Beyond the remarks made above the all-sufficient refutation to such a statement
is the present condition of the Hindu race itself. If any people on earth, more than others,
sin with “fatal facility” and seem perfectly oblivious to the character and consequences of
their deeds they are the descendants of the rishis of old and the heirs, in rich abundance,
of this and its cognate doctrines. To judge this doctrine by its results in India is to pronounce
it an error and a curse.

5. The Ideals of the Two Faiths.

No religion can regenerate or exalt men simply through a code of moral laws, or even through
impassioned appeals to a higher life and threats of eternal punishment. There must be, above
and beyond all this, a life which stands boldly forth as an example and inspiration to good
men. The noble example of the royal Gautama did more perhaps than any other thing to disseminate
Buddhism throughout India. His supreme renunciation and his loyalty to truth exalted him before
his disciples and transformed him into an ideal for Buddhists of future ages. This also is
a preëminent characteristic of Christianity. It is the religion of the Christ. He stands supreme
in it—not merely as its Founder, Expounder and Life. He is also the embodiment of His own teaching,
the ideal of life and conduct which He has brought to men. His command to all is not—“Do this
or that”; but “Follow Me”—not, “Believe in this truth or another,” but “Believe in Me,” who
am “the way, the truth and the life.” For these twenty centuries He has stood before the world
as the incomparable, unapproachable, perfect ideal which has wrought more for the regeneration
of the world than all other forces put together.

Do we find any counterpart to this in Hinduism? Do we find any life or example which stands
related to it as Buddha’s to Buddhism or as Mohammed’s to Mohammedanism, or, even in a slight
degree, as Christ’s to Christianity? None whatever. Starting with the absolute Brâhm, we have
seen this Supreme Soul shrouded in unfathomable, unapproachable darkness. We descend to the
divine emanations of this eternal Soul and search in vain among the millions of beings which
constitute the Hindu pantheon to find one who could become an ideal of life and an inspiration
to the soul struggling against sin. “Godlike life could scarcely start from its examples of
incarnations; for none of their lives is superhuman in holiness. Even Rama, the most blameless
character in Hindu mythological literature, is by no means perfect; while the most popularly
worshipped incarnation committed deeds so vile that even the narrator warns his hearers not
to take him for their example. ‘Listen to the story of Hari, but do not think of doing his
deeds,’ he says.”

We look again at the sages and heroes of India with the hope that we may possibly find one
who stood conspicuous among others as the perfect type of character and the helper of those
struggling after a better and holier life. Here again we are wofully disappointed, though it
must be confessed that there are loftier types of goodness and of self-discipline among them
than we found among the gods. Thus, with no worthy ideal of life before them and no one to
inspire them to better things, the wonder is that men in India have not descended to a lower
level than they have. It is perhaps this very reason that has discouraged them and has led
them to strive to attain unto beatitude, not by perfecting, but by destroying humanity. The
renunciation and loss, rather than the realization, of self has thus become their aim and ambition.
Perhaps it is for this same reason also that the votaries of this faith have constructed one
of the most elaborate systems of ceremonial and ritual that the world has ever witnessed; whereby,
in the absence of a high ideal and of a divine inspiration, the whole life from birth even
until after death, may be directed and protected from evil.

6. The Credentials of the Two Faiths.

Each has its Scriptures in which are found its original teachings including a declaration of
its source and message to man. Beyond this general statement very little can be predicated
of these two in common. The theories of their inspiration are dissimilar. In the Bible there
is no theory of inspiration taught. Its testimony to its own divine origin is indirect rather
than direct. And yet the evidence, both internal and external, that the Bible was written by
men under Divine guidance and inspiration is unmistakable and convincing. Whether we have regard
to its prophetic utterances, its record of miracles, its plan of salvation, its delineation
of the incomparable life and character of Jesus Christ; or whether we behold its marvellous
power among men of all classes and of all countries and tongues—all that pertain to it point
unmistakably to its divine origin.

Nor can any one fail to appreciate the beauty and sublimity of some of the Vedic hymns of the
Hindus or the profound depth of the philosophic reach of the Upanishads, those sublime “guesses
at truth,” or the great excellence of the Bhagavad-Gita which is the gem of all Hindu literature.
And yet the puerilities of many and the obscenity of others of the Vedic songs and prayers
are well-known. So are the strange vagaries and the rambling character of many parts of the
Upanishads. And as for the Bhagavad-Gita it is simply a dialogue whose gist is the argument
of Krishna—“the Supreme God”—to urge the tender-hearted and the conscience-smitten Arjuna to
slay his relatives in war. Its argument is that no evil which one man may do to another is
of any moment, since he cannot touch his soul which is eternal and beyond the reach of any
human power! In the destiny of a soul what can the destruction of one of its bodies signify?
This is an argument which is subversive of morality and of social order.

When one leaves these earlier scriptures of Brahmanism and takes up the later productions—the
Puranas and Tantras—he comes into a very different atmosphere, most of which is morally pestilential
and spiritually degrading. The ascription of divine inspiration and special heavenly guidance
in the production of such literature is nought else but blasphemy. To pass over from the study
of the Bible, with its transcendent beauty, its perfect ethics, its heavenly spirit, its Divine
Saviour and way of salvation, to the Scriptures of India, especially the more recent parts,
is to exchange the pure air of heaven for the charnel house.

The “divine brevity” of the Bible is one of its most striking features. Few things could impress
one with the heavenly source of this Book more markedly than its wonderful omissions.

How very different when we examine the countless tomes of the sacred literature of India! If
the salvation of a soul depended upon the reading of even a hundredth part of these, who then
could be saved? Their very multiplicity and their voluminous character debar any man, however
learned, from an acquaintance with more than a small fraction of them. Moreover, among learned
pandits of today the Smriti (traditions) are more frequently quoted as authority, and they
wield a larger power over the life of the people, than the Sruti (revelation) itself.

In the Christian Bible we are permitted to see a progressive revelation. From age to age, and
from page to page, we see new glimpses of truth and are attracted by the divine light whose
illumination grows ever brighter from Genesis to Revelation. This is what we should have expected
from a God-inspired book. We should have looked forward to a gradual transition from the starry
midnight of the far-off past to the rising, in Christ, of the sun of righteousness with healing
in His wings.

In Hindu literature this process is reversed. The surest, I may almost say, the only, evidence
we have of divine guidance in the production of this literature is to be found among the earliest
productions. There we see earnestness of purpose combined with heavenly aspiration and deep
searching after truth. Subsequent to this we see the light vanishing and earnestness giving
place to triviality of thought, to the ravings of superstition, to the inanities of ceremonialism
and to the laws of social and religious bondage. All this progress downward is in direct ratio
to our distance from Vedic times.

What could be more conclusive proof of the human source and direction of these prolific writings?
Educated Hindus are sensible of this fact. They constantly hark back to the Vedas, to the Upanishads
and to the Bhagavad-Gita, conscious of the fact that these represent the high water-mark of
their faith and literature.

7. Other Distinguishing Traits.

These are not a few, and they aid in presenting the two faiths in bold relief.

(a) Their attitude towards the individual and Society. Nowhere are they more antipodal to each
other than here. Christianity is preëminently a faith which exalts the individual. It presents,
with marked clearness, his rights and responsibilities. His liberty of thought, of belief and
of action, is fundamentally sacred and to be conserved at all hazards.

Hinduism is the staunchest foe of individual freedom. It concedes no right to the individual
which others are bound to respect. It has erected above the individual, and in such a way as
to overshadow him entirely, the stupendous caste system. And it has subordinated his every
right and privilege to the whim of this demon caste. Man is its abject slave—cannot swerve
one inch from its dictates; and these reach down to the smallest detail of his life. If the
vast majority of the members of a caste were high in their morals and strict in their integrity
and pure in their beliefs, the aid to a higher life which this system might render to the individual
would, in small part, compensate for its destruction of his manly independence. But caste discipline
directs itself to petty forms and observances and to the perpetuation of mean jealousies rather
than to the development of character.

In India alone is caste a religious institution. The Brahman merged the individual in the corporate
body, thus perfecting his bondage; and he set class against class to prevent the lower from
rising and to make national union impossible. Men were said to have been created differently
even as different kinds of animals; to bring them together is as unnatural as it is sinful.

Thus, every man within the pale of this religion has his social, as his religious, status fixed
unchangeably for him before his birth; and woe be to him who tries to shake off this bondage,
or even in a small degree to kick against the pricks. No better system than this has been devised
under heaven to rob man of his birthright of independence and self-respect. And the population
of India bears, in its character and conduct, ample testimony to the truth of this statement.

(b) Connected closely with this is another aspect.

The religion of Jesus fosters progress. Not only do we behold Christian nations the most progressive,
we also find that as this faith obtains in its purity, so do its votaries enjoy the large spirit
and results of progress, both in religion, science, the arts and in civilization. In India,
on the other hand, conservatism is a fetish and custom a divine law of conduct. In the West
the question asked, as men approach a certain line of action, is whether it be reasonable?
Among Hindus the invariable inquiry is,—is it customary?—did our forefathers practice it? This
again is the legitimate product of the caste system. It conserves and deifies the past. It
never tolerates a question as to the wisdom of the ancients. The code of Manu, which is the
source and supreme authority for this system, has done more to stereotype and degrade social
and religious life in India than has any other code in all the history of other lands.

(c) Another marked feature of the religion of Jesus is its exclusiveness. It claims to be the
only way of salvation. Not that it is unwilling to acknowledge the truths which are found in
other faiths. While it recognizes such, it maintains that they are but broken lights of the
Truth which it presents in all its full-orbed glory. It reveals Christ as the fulfillment of
the good and pious of all nations, and His revelation as the realization of all truth wherever
found. But as a means of salvation it stands alone, and will brook no rivalry nor accept divided
homage.

In Hinduism, on the other hand, we see tolerance incarnate. It is true that the caste system
lends itself readily to intolerance, that some of the most refined and cruel forms of persecution
are conducted by it against Christians today. Yet in itself this faith has a genius for toleration.
It does not go out of its way to attack other faiths. On the contrary it generally reaches
forward the flag of truce and peace to them. It willingly appropriates much of their teaching
and ritual. It placed in its pantheon its arch-enemy, Buddha, and has dignified many of the
demons of the primitive cult of South India in the same way. And herein lie the subtle power
and supreme danger which inhere in it to other faiths.

(d) It must also be remembered that the faith of India is an ethnic faith, with no ambition
to reach to other peoples beyond that peninsula. This faith has a hundred ways of expelling
and excommunicating its members and only one doubtful door by which it may receive outsiders,
namely, by the formation of a new caste.

Christianity, on the other hand, is preëminently a missionary religion. It claims to be the
universal faith. The last commandment of the Lord upon earth and the first work of the Holy
Spirit upon His descent was to propagate the faith and to carry it to many lands and peoples.
Hinduism is conserved by its social organism of caste; Christianity, by its leavening influence
upon all that comes in contact with it, and the outreaching power of its life within.

(e) Another difference is observable in the fact that while Christianity is always held as
a system of saving truth to be believed, Hinduism, in its acceptance, does not involve the
necessary belief of any doctrine or system of doctrine. It is well understood that a man of
any belief, or of no belief, may be a genuine and orthodox Hindu provided he observes caste
rules and ceremonies. It has been more than once insisted upon that a man may accept Christ
as his Saviour and His religion as his firm belief and still remain a Hindu if he only submit
to the demands of caste. Not a few Hindus are trying to live up to this strange dual system
today! And I fear some native Christians have not got rid of the same delusion.

(f) There is also a marked difference in the moral standards of the two faiths. In a certain
sense the moral code of Brahmanism, at its best, is lofty if not perfect. It enjoins a man
not to lie, not to steal, not injure another, to be just, brave, hospitable and self-controlled.
Some savage races inculcate, with more or less severity, the same moral lessons. But to Hindus
as to savages these injunctions have represented the moral code; and whoever, among them, attains
unto these, mostly negative, virtues, is deemed worthy of praise. In a sense the ten commandments
communicated through Moses, obtain among Christians and are enjoined upon them today. But they,
rather than represent the Christian’s ideal, indicate only the low water mark of his moral
requirements. To say of a Christian gentleman today that he does not steal, or does not lie,
is rather an insult than a compliment, since it assumes that he possesses only what is now
considered a very elementary form of morality, such as the lower classes and children are supposed
to practice. It is only as we follow Jesus Christ and sublimate this code in love (Matt. 22:37-40)
that we rise to the full significance and divine content of morality. The Christian code rests
not in negation, but commands a life of outgoing, active love. A lofty altruism must permeate
his every act and give colouring to his whole life. Christ not only introduced and emphasized
this golden rule; He taught that it was absolutely necessary (John 12:25; Matt. 5:44).

To the Hindu, on the other hand, the lex talionis is a law of life still enforced. See, e.g.,
Vishnu Purana 5:19. He never thinks nor is he commanded by his religion to think, of aught
but outward conformity to a moral code which is altogether inadequate to keep, direct and inspire
him in life. This difficulty is, of course, enhanced when we remember that in the whole realm
of Hindu life—whether it be of gods or of men—there is no one who looms up as a perfect example.
It is therefore little wonder that in India today morality is at so low an ebb and that even
the code which prevails there is so sadly and universally violated.

Considering therefore these two faiths in all their characteristics and tendencies we are warranted
in concluding that Hinduism must wane and vanish. It is an ancient faith and has survived not
a few storms. It has a strong place in the hearts of a great people. But the leaven of dissolution
and death is mightily at work within it today. The times are changed, new circumstances are
bringing in a revolution of thought. Foreign ideas, language and customs are the rage; a new
civilization, the deadly foe to the strongholds of the faith, is supplanting the old. This
faith has nothing to offer with a view to meeting this new and complicated situation. It opposes
all progress; through its pundits and orthodox defenders it antagonizes modern civilization
and scientific advancement at every point. It is given up to degrading idolatry and a debasing,
all-absorbing ceremonialism. It is the foster-mother of ignorance.

The mighty influence of Christianity, on the other hand, is being felt by all in the land;
and the thousand-headed, thousand-handed civilization of the West is grasping and slowly transforming
all their ideas of life. Verily India is in the throes of a new birth. Hinduism has done some
good, doubtless. It has had a mission in the world and that has unquestionably been, partly,
in the conservation of the great doctrine of God’s immanence at a time when the western world
had largely forgotten it. But this work is no longer needed. Today this truth is emphasized
also by the Christian Church, and in the safe and practical way, in combination and harmony
with the personality and fatherhood of God.

We can therefore look forward with confidence to the ultimate issue of this great conflict
and see, through faith, the day when Christ shall reign supreme in that land.

During the many centuries of its history and working in India Hinduism has had ample opportunity
to produce its own type of religious devotee, one who is thoroughly representative of its teaching
and life. This type abounds in India today and is a faithful reflection of that faith. We shall
now endeavour to study that living embodiment of Hinduism. In one respect it will be but another
way of studying the faith itself—perhaps the best of all methods of studying a religion, for
it is thus presented in life and action.

Protestant Christianity has not been sufficiently long in India to develop and foster an Indian
type of character of its own. And yet we see it rapidly working towards that consummation.
A century is too brief a time for this purpose. Moreover, native Christian life in that land
is too much under the dominance and guidance of the West to enjoy a large degree of spontaneity;
and without spontaneity life is not natural.

Nevertheless, the century that has passed has brought into existence the fourth generation
of Protestant native Christians in India; and we are able to see, to some extent, among these
descendants of native Christians that tendency and bent which will ere long develop into a
definite and settled type of its own. For the time being we can only study the native Christian
as a prophecy—a prophecy not for many years to be fulfilled in all its details, and yet worthy
of study both in itself and for what it suggests.

Let us consider, then, these types of the two faiths which we see in that land.

1. And First, The Hindu.

The Hindu Devotee is a genuine product of his religion, wrought out during thirty centuries
on its native heath. He stands before us as a distinct type whose characteristics differentiate
him from the followers of any other religion.

It is well to remember here that that modern product—the Hindu of Western culture who is so
much in evidence today in India and who sometimes comes West in flowing orange robes and turban
to urge his mongrel philosophy upon our fellow-countrymen—is not the type of Hindu appreciated
by, or representing, the people of that land. Neither in life nor in teaching does he represent
the faith whose name he bears. He is a man who has studied Western thought and religion under
the guidance and inspiration, perhaps, of the Christian missionary; and then in an ingenious
way strives to interpret his own faith in the light of his Western attainments. He presents
to us not orthodox Hinduism, but a mongrel doctrine and philosophy which are as foreign to
the teaching of the orthodox Hindu pundit and as alien to the Hindu Scriptures as they are
to Western philosophy and faith. It is a significant fact that all these Western-travelled
Hindus have first to violate a fundamental injunction of their own religion—namely, that which
prohibits sea travelling to a Hindu—before they can visit the West in order to commend their
faith. And when they return to their native country they do so as the outcastes of their religion,
and can be reinstated only after performing a work of atonement which includes the disgusting
act of eating the five products of the cow!

The real Hindu, who stands today as the true exponent of his faith, is a very different man.
He would no more cross the seas than he would cut off his right arm; for he knows that he can
remain a true Hindu only so long as he remains at home. He is a conservative of the stiffest
kind. He thinks on ancient lines and swears by the rishis of old.

(a) Study his prepossessions and then alone can you appreciate his heritage. Though he may
not be a scholar or a philosopher, he is nevertheless fortified by a host of religious beliefs
and prejudices. A thousand dogmas and prepossessions, the inherited treasures of thirty centuries,
are his. He drank them in with his mother’s milk; he has breathed them in as an essential part
of his daily environment. They are more than second nature to him and constitute largely the
world of his thought. His ideas of God, of himself, of sin, of salvation, of human life—all
are far removed from ours and are peculiarly his own. He feels himself to be in the toils of
an iron destiny which slowly grinds him to powder. His conception of God brings him no ray
of comfort, or hope of release. His idea is that his sin and suffering of today are the inflictions,
by some unknown power, for the sins of supposed former births. So that he must, through countless
ages, work out his own salvation—a salvation which indeed means eternal rest; but it is a rest
from all thought, emotion, self-consciousness and separate existence as well as from all work.

Within the mighty fascination of this Vedantism the people have been held through the centuries.
And it is a doctrine which renders the highest morality impossible and has proved the mightiest
soporific to the conscience. A few years ago a murderer in South India was being led from the
court of justice to prison where, soon, he was to be executed for his crime. As he was struggling
in the street with the police, a missionary accosted him, urging him to confess his sin against
God and to seek his peace. Whereupon the man replied, “I did not commit the murder; it was
the work of God Himself, in whose hands I am and of whom I am part.” To this the missionary
replied that this was neither true nor worthy, and that he would soon suffer the full penalty
of the law for his crime. “Ah, yes,” he exclaimed, “the god who wrought this in me and through
me, will put me to death. It is all his and I am he.”

Such is the line of thought which passes through the mind of the orthodox Hindu devotee under
all circumstances, be they pleasant or disagreeable. And it is one of the most difficult things
for him, under these circumstances, to cultivate a true sense of responsibility and a genuine
conception of sin as a moral act.

(b) See again his ideals. He has many such which influence him largely in his life. Much depends
upon what a man regards as the Summum Bonum of life. The supreme blessing which the Hindu ever
holds before his eyes, as the highest and last attainment, is union with God. Not a union of
sympathy, but a metaphysical oneness with Brâhm. To lose himself entirely in the Divine Being
and thus to cease having separate thought or existence, and to pass out of the turmoil and
restlessness of human life into the calm of the passionless bosom of the Eternal—this, to him,
is the ideal which alone is worthy of human attainment.

Again; we, Christians, look forward to a complete self-realization, to a perfect manhood and
a full rounded character as our ideal. The opposite ideal is the Hindu’s. He seeks the loss
of all that we hold best—the elimination of every ambition and desire, the eradication of all
love and altruism, the cessation of all activity—good as well as evil. His ideal is not greatness
and goodness of heart, but the renunciation of all that animates and inspires. To him the highest
virtue in its noblest activity has no charms; for he claims that he looks above and beyond
all this to that absolute equilibrium of soul when passion, and when all desire, shall have
been killed through self-mortification and self-abnegation and he shall have attained mental
poise and repose rather than a perfect character. Thus, in its last analysis, his ideal is
an intellectual, rather than a moral, one; for it is again absorption into the Divine Soul;
and that he conceives to be the Supreme Intelligence rather than the Perfect Will. This difference
of ideal between the two faiths is fundamental and must work for very diverse results.

In harmony with this is the other thought that the body, yea each and every body with which
the soul may clothe itself, is an unmitigated evil because it is the highway to suffering and
defers the final consummation. Hence, the Hindu has no respect for the body and longs for the
day of final emancipation from flesh and all its ills.

How then shall the soul be freed from its many births so that it may pass out of this bondage
into the final freedom of Sayutcha, or emancipation? To him Yoga, the way of meditation, represents
the highest way of release. To wean the mind, through this process, from all desire and ambition
and thus to reach absolute equilibrium of soul is the object of Yoga. This indeed is the only
condition whereby the soul can rise above any future contact with earthly bodies.

Consequently the Hindu has, for many centuries, looked to the monastery and the wilderness
as the only places where this ideal can be safely and speedily attained. To live among men,
and thus to be subjected to corroding cares and to the swaying passions of human society, renders
the attainment of beatification impossible. Under these circumstances the soul finds no way
of emancipation. Therefore the watchword of the Hindu is, “flee from the world rather than
overcome it.” For the attainment of those qualities which ensure final repose he immures himself
in a mutt or he flees into the forest where, apart from men, he gives himself to self-mortification
and meditation that he may speedily find the desired release. At the root of this idea, as
its animating motive, lies the worthy ambition of living a better life than the environments
of a corrupt society favour. And with this desire is coupled the idea that a full rounded life
and a perfected character are not only possible in the solitude of a wilderness but are nowhere
else attainable. And thus it is, with many, a silent acknowledgment of failure and of the belief
that in the rush and struggle of public life a godly, heavenly-minded character is impossible.
According to the Hindu conception, a man may be successful in business matters, but he cannot
be holy or fit for the highest communion with God unless he spend his time in separation from
all his kind. Therefore the so-called pious and holy men of that land are ascetics. They eschew
human society and seek to renounce all human good and every earthly ambition.

With this purpose, ostensibly, in view there are, as we saw, about 5,500,000 men in India who
have given up all earthly employment, who live apart as ascetics and spend their time in roaming
around the country as religious mendicants. These people are, in the main, doubtless possessed
of the laudable ambition to be holy and to prepare themselves for union with Brâhm. And yet,
as a matter of fact, they are the most pestilential in their morals of all the people of the
land. Many of them, at the same time, both regard themselves and are regarded by their co-religionists
as the acme of piety. Nevertheless, they daily trample under foot every command of the decalogue.
It is true that a few of them are different from the mass, and genuinely seek the higher life
for the cultivation of which they have separated themselves. But into their ideal of life altruism
hardly enters at all. It is not to do good unto others, but to escape contamination from others
which is the concern of the Hindu devotee. At the basis of his higher aspirations concern for
self is supreme, thoughts of others are absent.

A notable illustration of a high realization of the Eastern ideal we see in the famous Hindu
ascetic Swamiji Bhaskara Nanda Sarasvati, of Benares, who recently died and to whom Dr. Fairbairn
has referred so cordially. For many years he had given himself to devotion and meditation.
He had subdued the body by the rigours of asceticism and had attained preëminence in self-restraint
and in the highest wisdom of yoga culture. He had therefore retired from the world, spurned
all its allurements, denied all its claims and devoted himself exclusively to thought and meditation.
Thus immured within temple walls in the great city of Benares he was utterly oblivious to the
sin and sorrow of the swarming multitudes of that city and did nought to relieve the suffering,
or to improve the lives, of his fellow-beings. He died, and over his remains has been erected
a shrine to which the thousands go for worship and for inspiration to attain unto that ideal
of life which they believe him to have realized.

This ideal has, for centuries, taken possession of the Hindu mind, and never before did it
rule with more absolute sway than it does at present.

Another ideal of life with the Hindu is the so-called “path of works.” At present this term
is synonymous with a life of ceremonialism. In modern parlance “works” means to the Hindu,
ceremonial observance. His life is hedged in on all sides by a host of ceremonies and is permeated
through and through with a most complicated ritual. There is nothing in the life of a Hindu
devotee, whether it be eating, sleeping, bathing or travelling, which is not religiously prescribed
both as to time and method. And utterly regardless of the significance of these rites or the
appropriateness of them to his life, he deems their observance as essential to his salvation
and finds in their daily keeping the highest satisfaction and completest assurance of his spiritual
progress.

The Hindu is no rationalist in his religion. He obeys implicitly, and without question, the
ritual of his ancestors and finds no interest in the scrutiny or analysis of them.

So, to the ordinary Hindu, especially to him to whom the way of meditation in the wilderness
seems impossible, ceremonialism becomes a matter of supreme concern. No other religion has
furnished to its followers a more elaborate and pervasive system of observances than this.
These rites exercise their influence upon the mind and are wielding today a most potent influence
upon Hindu character. A man may think nothing of, nor have any ambition to attain unto, the
spiritual aspect of his faith; he may give no time whatever to any of its teachings or spiritual
instruction; but if he maintain its ritual with ordinary care he flatters himself with the
thought that he has attained a perfection corresponding to his estate.

Moreover, the Hindu is a thorough fatalist. He believes that his destiny is “written upon the
forehead.” Nothing which he may do can affect this destiny. Nor does it seem to be a part of
the divine purpose. So far as he is concerned it is an irrevocable fate. This belief manifests
itself largely in his life and conduct. It is one of the inconsistencies of the Hindu’s thinking
that he, at the same time, worships a tribal god in whose hands he believes his affairs to
be, and through whom prosperity can flow into his life for time and eternity; and yet he holds,
with equal, yea with greater, persistence, the law of Karma, that is, the law of works, according
to which law alone future life, both to himself and to all men, must be wrought out even to
the last detail. It is strange that a man whose pantheon is so crowded as that of the Hindu,
and who believes in such constant divine guidance and interference, should, also, at the same
time, maintain a theory of life which practically dispenses with all divine action and makes
human life the product of a blind and grinding fate. Nothing is more marked as a characteristic
of Hindu thought today than a possession by the people of these mutually conflicting and contradictory
views of life.

(c) Looking at the Hindu from a social standpoint we see him largely affected by the caste
system. Not only is his life in bondage to this system, his view of life, too, is thoroughly
coloured by his caste sentiments.

Just as ceremonialism covers all his personal life, even so caste observance defines for him
all his social relations. There is not a tie or an influence which binds man to man that is
not, to the Hindu, a part of the great and all-embracing caste system. So all-pervasive is
this social tyranny that a man dare not withstand it; yea, more, he has learned to look at
it as the prime necessity of his social being and therefore invariably regards it as the highest
good. He may indeed believe that, in the abstract, caste is an evil and that it has been a
curse to the people of the land. But he nevertheless maintains that, as it is an ancient part,
and a most important part, of his ancestral faith, it must be submitted to in all obedience
and regarded as the ideal of life.

The Bhagavad-Gita is regarded today not only as the gem of all Hindu literature; it is also
held up by educated Hindus as the highest authority among their Shastras. For better far Abandon
life at once than not fulfill One’s own appointed work; another’s duty Brings danger to the
man who meddles with it. Perfection is alone attained by him Who swerves not from the business
of his caste.”

Therefore the Hindu has come to regard caste observance as the supreme claim of his faith.
As we have seen, a man may believe or disbelieve any doctrine he please; that does not affect
his status as a Hindu so long as he is loyal to caste rules and observances. As one has aptly
remarked, the seat of other religions may be in the mind; the seat of Hinduism is preëminently
in the stomach. It is not what he thinks but what and how and with whom he eats that gives
him his religious status.

The Hindu regards himself as socially devoid of any right of initiative and choice; he has
no will of his own. His social conscience is in the keeping of his caste. This has gained its
rules from the past and exercises no discretion or judgment of its own in the social direction
of its members; but it insists upon implicit obedience, by every one, to past customs which
have crystallized into irrevocable laws. And to these laws the Hindu is always and everywhere
a willing and an abject slave. To violate any of them is, he well knows, to be recreant to
his faith and to be an outcaste among his people.

(d) The Hindu is not strong in character, as Westerners regard strength. As we have seen, his
religion is not favourable to the highest development of conscience. Hence, sincerity and truthfulness
are not among his strong points. Not only does pantheism undermine conscience, the example
of the most prominent gods of the Hindu pantheon, leads men to prevaricate and encourages all
forms of duplicity. Under these circumstances it were strange if the Hindu were conspicuous
in honesty and in loyalty to the truth. And in like manner he is wanting largely in those convictions
which, in the West, are so inseparably associated with earnestness, integrity and lofty purpose.
If, to the Hindu devotee, religion is not a system of truth to be believed and loyally followed,
but a series of ceremonies to be observed and of caste rules to be obeyed, then loyalty to
truth becomes a very secondary matter and integrity of mind will be regarded by him as of no
great moment. Therefore it is that hollowness is so often found at the core of their life.
Lying and stealing are all but universal. It is said in our District in South India that the
regular price of a court witness is two annas (four cents); and he stands ready to perjure
himself to any extent for this paltry sum. The ordinary Hindu seems too often to have a predilection
for falsehood and uses truth with rare economy! There, dishonesty and petty larceny are foibles
too frequently condoned because too generally practiced. Even among the higher classes—the
cultured and élite—open-faced and open-handed frankness and sincerity are too rare. Hypocrisy
and duplicity are too often cultivated as a fine art. It seems to be the pride and pleasure
of an Oriental to conceal his mind and purpose and to say and do things by the greatest indirection
possible.

India has been extolled as a land where there is no profanity. This is true and she should
have the credit for this abstinence. And one never feels like giving her this credit more than
when he returns from that country to this and is compelled to endure the coarse profanity which
pervades our streets as a terrible stench.

Yet one can hardly see how the Hindu could find interest in, and a strong grip upon, profanity,
so long as the gods of his pantheon have so little of his respect and enter so rarely into
the serious compacts of his life. Moreover it should not be forgotten that obscenity fulfills
in India the function of profanity in the West. The bursts of passion which find expression
here through taking the name of God in vain gain utterance there in language unspeakably bad
of the other kind. And this is only a part of the larger subject of the prevalence of social
immorality in India—an evil which is largely fostered under the protection of the religion
of the land. When Lord Dalhousie, the Viceroy of India, was considering an act for the suppression
of obscenity in the country, he was compelled by Hindu sentiment to exempt all temples and
religious emblems from the operation of the act! What better commentary could one desire upon
the source and prevalence of this vice in that land? When such an evil is intrenched behind
the religion of the people and is symbolized and fostered by its emblems and ceremonies—when
tasies, or women dedicated to the Hindu gods and temple worship (there are 12,000 of these
in South India alone), constitute the public characters of the land—then the hope for the purification
of life is at the lowest ebb.

It is also very rare that one finds a Hindu whose convictions and loyalty to certain beliefs
are such that he is willing to suffer in their behalf. That masculine vigour and manly persistence
under difficulty in maintaining what he believes to be right and true is not germane to the
Hindu character.

On the other hand, the Hindu is strong in the so-called passive virtues. In harmony with his
religious beliefs, patience and meekness and endurance of evil have become second nature to
him. This side of his character has, indeed, received undue emphasis during the many centuries
of his history. He cannot understand the rush and impatience, the push and aggressiveness of
the Westerner any more than he of the West can understand the Hindu’s cool, quiet, patient,
bearing under most trying and adverse circumstances. He has a large lesson to teach us in the
art of self-control and in the ability to endure with complacency evils which cannot be remedied.

Thus as we look at the Hindu from the various standpoints of life and character we see how
strange a compound he is, and how unlike the man of the West at nearly all points in our examination.
He is preëminently weak where we are strong, and he manifests strength where we seem to need
it most. His religion has developed within him traits and tendencies which, through these many
centuries, have wonderfully wrought in his life and character, and have largely made him what
he is today.

Moreover all this enables us to see what a serious problem Christianity has in hand in India
today, namely the conversion of 230,000,000 people so far removed in life and sentiment from
those who have gone to preach Christ to them. Yea, more, we have seen what mighty influences
and forces Christianity has to overcome, what hosts of prejudices to destroy, before she can
lay her hand in power upon that great land and claim it as her own.

2. Let us Now Study The Native Christian.

The Indian Christian, as we have seen, is a recent product, so far as Protestant Christianity
is concerned. And yet we are glad to witness a marked development in the life and character
of those who are connected with the Protestant missions. It is true that fully one-half of
the Christian community there found has been connected with our faith no more than a quarter
of a century. But as we compare these recent accessions to our faith with those Christians
of a second, third and fourth generation we are much encouraged by the growth in Christian
character and principle which is taking place. I have often studied these differences between
the recent convert and the Christian-born member of the community. I have also compared those
of the second, with those of the third and fourth, generation of Christian heritage; and I
have been much encouraged to see that our faith is adding to its power over the life and character
of the native Christian community as the years and generations increase. And if the work continues,
with the present insistence and vigour, it will not take many generations more before Christianity
will have become thoroughly indigenous, because it will have developed a type of character
in that land fully in harmony with its own genius and teaching.

It is necessary, however, in considering this question, that we remember specially that the
antecedents and the environment of the native Christian have been entirely Hindu. His ancestral
faith has coloured, and must colour, largely his religious preceptions and conduct. Let it
not be thought that, when a man abandons Hinduism and becomes a Christian, he thereby, once
and for all, drives out of his mind all those prepossessions, prejudices and superstitions
which he has inherited from the past. It will take a long time for him to separate himself
from these and their influence. Many of them will probably cling to him during his whole life.
It is as much as we can hope that Christian truth will take increasing possession of his mind
and gradually supplant the old and unworthy beliefs of Hinduism.

There are moreover certain elements of truth in that old faith which we do not care to eliminate
from his mental furnishing, but which must find new adjustment and be properly located in the
new religion which he has adopted.

It should also be remembered and made prominent in our consideration of this subject that the
people of India are an Oriental people and are the children of the tropics and, as such, will
always remain and must remain very different from us of the Northwest. Their climatic and meteorological
conditions, their outer, physical life, their social customs and the trend of their civilization,
have always been, and will continue to be, far removed from our own. Nothing could be more
fatal to our success in our effort for the conversion of India than the idea that we must in
every respect mold them after the pattern of Western life and habits. A large portion of their
life is the result of the conditions which I have mentioned and must largely remain unchanged;
and it would be folly for the missionary to regard these as a part of the faith to be supplanted,
and to teach that western social customs are inseparable from Christianity and must be accepted
by the Orient with our faith. The Christian of India will always be, and it is well that he
should be, differentiated from the Anglo-Saxon Christian.

It should also be remembered that the people of India, at least the masses, are low in civilization.
It should not be expected that those who are in that low estate, when they become Christians,
will leap with one bound into the full possession of a high civilization and be clothed upon
with some of those beauties of western life and character which we inevitably associate with
the term, “A Christian Gentleman.” They, indeed, become truly and sincerely the disciples of
Christ; but they will, at the same time, manifest some of the crudities and weaknesses of the
low social grade of which they have been and still remain a part. They should not be judged
by standards Western or of a high civilization.

Looking, then, at the native Christian of India let us have regard to his condition socially,
morally, religiously and spiritually.

(a) Studying this product of the Christian faith in that land from a social standpoint we find
encouragement. He differs from his Hindu neighbour by a growing freedom from the trammels of
caste. He feels, in his best moments, that caste has been and continues to be the greatest
curse of the land, that he has been emancipated from it, and that he is ambitious to enjoy
the liberty wherewith Christ has made him free. And yet, unfortunately, he does not remain
constantly in the possession of this sane mind. The roots of the caste system have reached
down into the lowest depths of his being. Even at times when he believes that he is absolutely
independent of caste considerations, there is in him a blind persistence which clings to caste
bondage. I have often felt that Hinduism can be dispensed with by our convert with vastly more
ease in all other particulars than in its caste feelings and affiliations. This relic of the
past clings to him with a tenacity which is phenomenal and most sad. Though everything teaches
him that this caste system is the greatest enemy of Christianity and will prevent any one who
believes and practices it from fully imbibing the spirit of Christ; and though he aspires to
be an earnest and an efficient Christian and to love all his brethren, this remnant of Hinduism
in his heart returns to rob him of the joys and blessings of his Christian birthright. I have
seen this frequently disfigure what would otherwise have been a beautiful Christian character.
I have witnessed it blast the prospects of Christian congregations dooming them to stagnation
and death. I have known it to palsy the arm and deaden the heart of more than one Christian worker.

All this is inevitable when we remember the mighty influence and the long continued dominance
of caste in that land. But even at this point, where the missionary finds the greatest discouragement,
there are marked signs of progress. So long as the missionary fought this evil alone there
was little hope of success. But, during the last few years, the conscience of the native Christian
Church itself has been roused on this question. The Indian Christian today, as never before,
has the conviction that this caste evil saps the spiritual life of every member and of every
church which entertains it, and that it is his supreme duty to fight it steadily in his own
heart, home and church. And there is an increasing number, especially of the young Christians,
who are pledging themselves to an unceasing warfare against the demon caste. Christians are
also organizing themselves into Caste Suppression Societies. All this is highly encouraging,
but needs large furtherance and development before the native Christian can be said to be freed
from this most subtle curse of the ancestral faith.

The old Hindu Joint Family System is the foster-mother of the caste idea, and it is cheering
to see native Christians increasingly abandoning that system for the Western idea of home which
encourages thrift, independence and liberty among the various members of a family and clan.

In India, for many years to come, this blight of social narrowness, exclusiveness and divisiveness
will affect more or less the native Christian character and give colour to the native Christian
Church. For centuries it may prove the weak spot of Indian Christianity.

(b) Morally, the native Christian develops slowly. One writer has recently claimed that the
Christian of India manifests little, if any, preëminence over the Hindu, in this respect. This
is not true. He is certainly moving forward and upward morally. But it should be remembered
that moral character is not one of the first results of Christian conquest among such a people.
It is rather the highest and last fruit upon the tree of Christian life. It should not be forgotten
that what we regard in the West as the high moral traits of a Christian gentleman are the product
of more than 1,000 years of Christian living.

The native Christian manifests, in this respect, the weakness of his antecedents and his environment.
When we remember that weakness of character to which we have referred as belonging to the Hindu
it is not surprising that the native Christian, who is daily surrounded by men of that faith
and who imbibes the atmosphere of that religion, should largely be affected by the same evil.
A few years ago an English barrister complained to me of certain Christian witnesses who had
given evidence in a case recently conducted by him in Madura. “I hate to have your Christians
as witnesses in any of my cases,” he says; “for whenever they venture to give false evidence
they instantly falter and stumble and are caught by the opposing counsel. A Hindu, when he
gives false evidence, will tell a straight and a plausible story. But your Christians are too
much affected by twinges of conscience.” What was embarrassing and annoying to him was encouraging
to me! That our Christians should occasionally give false evidence did not surprise me; but
that they, in this matter, should be differentiated, by this disinterested observer, from Hindu
witnesses is a reliable testimony in favour of their growing veracity.

Among the higher class of native Christians, which is annually increasing in number, there
is marked improvement in character. Especially among mission agents do we have opportunity
to witness this development. They are growing in sincerity and reliability. The missionary
is learning, with increasing pleasure, to place confidence in their veracity. And yet, we must
mourn that moral progress among our people, both high and low, is not more rapid and satisfying.

Social immorality, as we have seen, is very prevalent in that tropical country. It is natural
that this should annoy and worry us greatly among our native Christians. It is a sad fact that
more of our mission agents are dismissed on account of this sin than any other. Hindu society
is not only largely demoralized by this evil, there is also no public sentiment against it.
But, under the influence of a growing sentiment in behalf of chastity and purity, the evil
is gradually diminishing among our native Christians.

One source of moral depravity in Hindu society is the prevalent belief among them that there
is no necessary connection between piety and morality. Their faith maintains that a man may
be an ardent and worthy devotee, and at the same time trample under foot every part of the
decalogue. Indeed the immorality of their religious ascetics is as noticeable as their profession
of piety. Nobody there questions their lofty faith, their deep piety, their supreme devotion
to their gods; nor will any one hesitate for one moment to charge them with every vice and
sin in the human catalogue. Such is the Hindu mind that it can and does believe that these,
to us, inseparable elements of a noble life, can be severed and found absolutely apart. In
India, today, the moral people are largely the non-religious; while the ostentatiously religious
are the publicly immoral ones.

It will take a long time for this fundamental and universally prevailing error to lose its
grip upon our Christian people in that land. We find, not infrequently, in the Christian community,
men and women living in unrighteousness and at the same time believing that it will be overlooked
in the Divine account because of their zeal in Christian advocacy or their offering for the
Christian cause. Perhaps this land of the West also is not free from such a delusion! We endeavour
to teach them, in the language of the Apostle Paul (1 Tim. 3:9), “to hold the mystery of the
faith in a pure conscience”; and we emphasize the supreme truth that faith and conscience,
piety and morality are one and inseparable.

(c) Religiously, the native Christian is slowly shaking off the clinging brood of superstitions
which he inherited from Hinduism. Our most recent converts have often a tenacious belief in
the efficacy of some of those childish superstitions and charms which were largely their main
stay in their ancestral religion. In most cases these are not a matter of faith so much as
of inheritance which have become more than a second nature to them. Idolatry may be abandoned,
belief in Hinduism as a saving faith may be thrown to the winds, Hindu ritual may lose its
charm; but the many little superstitions which are connected with private life and social customs
have still a quiet influence and a lingering power over them. These largely belong to the life
of those who have recently accepted the Christian faith. It may be that some of them will never
make that progress in life which will lift them entirely above some of these Hindu superstitions.
But the great majority of native Christians today have religiously had no connection whatever
with Hinduism and have entirely substituted Christian rites and observances for those of the
Hindu religion. And they apparently have large satisfaction in them. The old Hindu idea of
the supreme value of asceticism is largely yielding to a Christian altruism which abandons
self-centred, self-seeking, activity in favour of loving sympathy for, and an endeavour to
do good to, men.

We also notice that among them the idea of the efficacy of certain forms and ceremonies is
lessening in favour of a conviction of the power of the inner life of faith.

And yet it should be constantly kept in mind that ceremony and ritual must always find a larger
place in the religious life of India than in that of the United States. The inhabitant of India
is tropical and poetic in temperament. He beholds things, and appreciates and appropriates
spiritual blessings, more through the help of forms and ceremonies than does the man of the
West. A rite appeals to his nature more strongly and lends to him greater facility in getting
at its underlying truth and antitype than it does to us. Indeed it is his nature to look at
Christian truth through the eyes of a poet; and ceremonies consequently convey to him the largest
significance and are more revealing of the spirit within. We seek divine truth and spiritual
blessings more directly than he. It would be therefore a mistake for us to expect that practical,
unpoetic mind of ours in the Oriental, or to present religious truth to him in its nakedness,
unadorned and unenforced by rite and ritual. It has been, and, to some extent, continues to
be the fault of our Congregational Missions in India that they try to lift the native Christian
to those dry, unadorned, simple forms of religious service which indeed satisfy the missionaries,
but which ignore the great difference of nature and temperament between themselves and the
converts. It should be remembered that in India people think vocally. Even as they must and
do read aloud in order to read intelligently, so must they worship aloud in order to worship
feelingly and thoughtfully. Hence the wisdom and urgency for them of a ritual and a responsive
service.

(d) Spiritually, the Indian Christian is slowly and surely developing on definite lines of his own.

The simplicity of his faith is beautiful. He has none of those questions of doubt or misgivings
of unbelief which are so prevalent in the West. He takes the Bible in all fullness of acceptance.
His prayers are not crossed and frustrated by any rationalistic theories, but have the simplicity
of childish directness, filial trust and full expectancy. Nothing has touched me more in my
contact with native Christians than to feel the directness, simplicity, unquestioning trustfulness
of their prayers even in times of greatest adversity.

The native Christian possesses a mystic temperament. The inhabitants of that land, through
many centuries of training, have become natural mystics in religion. This national heritage
the native Christian retains; and properly chastened and directed by Christian truth and faith
it will add depth, beauty and power to his religious life. Under these conditions I shall have
no fear of mysticism in the Christian Church in India. Deep spirituality and a yearning after
the hidden things of religion is more natural to the East than to the West. The West is practical
and worldly; the East is mystical and other-worldly. The native Christian, at his best, is
manifesting some of this spiritual power. He takes naturally to the Pauline emphasis upon the
life “hid with Christ in God,” and to the mystic union which exists between Christ and His own.

It is here that the native Church in India is, I believe, to show an inspiring example to the
Church of the West. If the Christian of India is not to be as practical or indeed as spiritually
sane as his brother of the West, he will probably illustrate more of the hidden mysteries and
power of the spiritual life. In this respect the spiritual power of the East and that of the
West will be, in their separate emphasis, mutually complementary.

The Indian Christian, true to his native temperament, is and will continue to be strong in
the so-called passive virtues, and weak in the positive or aggressive ones. Patience, meekness,
gentleness, endurance—these are the graces which preëminently adorn him and which give colour
and shape to his religious character. Here, again, his life will be very different from that
life which has characterized, thus far, the Western Christian. The masculine virtues of assertion,
boldness, aggressiveness have characterized the West. We have been strong and continue strong
in that aspect of our faith which we associate with the words assertion and attack. The West
has, true to its environment and training, developed Christian character mostly, I will not
say exclusively, on the positive side of life. The equally important passive virtues we of
the West have much neglected if not despised as weakness. The East is even today manifesting
the blessedness, and the native Christian will increasingly illustrate, the beauty and potency,
of the passive virtues—of the spiritual element of endurance and non-resistance. He will show
to us that a true and perfected character—a character molded after that of the divine Exemplar—must
have also, and with equal emphasis, the sweet and feminine passive graces of life as an essential
element. In India today the Anglo-Saxon is wont to speak with contempt of “The mild Hindu.”
That mildness which we are too apt to despise contains the germs of that half of Christian
character which is too largely wanting in the spiritual life of the Anglo-Saxon and which the
Christian Church of India will increasingly illustrate and gradually seek to respect, honour,
and ultimately, to adopt.

Thus, speaking broadly of the native Christian of India today we find him almost as much a
product of heredity and environment as he is of Christianity. He holds out Christ before himself
as his ideal of life, and His words as the all-satisfying truth. He seeks in His redeeming
work rest and salvation of soul; but many of the deepest yearnings of his heart come to him
through old channels worn out by his ancestral faith. Hinduism gives more or less of colouring
to his religious thought and aspirations; and not a few of its forms and ceremonies are retained,
but filled with a new Christian content, and are utilized to aid in the development of Christian
life. Even as the Jews of old entered into possession and appreciation of Christian life through
Jewish rites and ceremonies, so do native converts enter Christian life through Hindu forms
today. From the necessity of their thought and being they utilize not a few of the processes
of the old, in order to acquire and enjoy the blessings of the new, faith. This cannot be avoided
nor do we desire that it should be avoided.

The study of the Indian Christian character in its peculiarities and tendencies is of importance,
because, as I have said above, I believe it is to affect our conceptions of life in the West.
At the present time not a few of the religious vagaries which infest our land such as Christian
Science and Theosophy, have chiefly come to us from India. At least, whatever of philosophy
they may possess, and all of the occultism and mysticism which they court and magnify, are
thoroughly Eastern and Indian. And from the popularity of such movements in this land it would
seem as if the boast of some men that Hindu thought is invading the West is partially true.
But the invasion which I desire and expect, in the not distant future, is the invasion of an
Oriental Christian thought, Christian life and Christian character. This will come in its time
as truly as, and much more fully than, the other has come, and it will do this country as much
good as the other is now doing evil.

As an illustration of what I mean in reference to the influence of Eastern thought upon the
West I would prophesy that ere long the Indian Christian Church will formulate for itself and
enunciate to the world an advanced and helpful doctrine of the Holy Ghost beyond anything that
the West has enunciated. India, which for these many centuries has been the home of an all-prevalent
spiritual pantheism, when it comes to elaborate the doctrine of God, from a Christian standpoint,
will give as much emphasis to His immanence as the West has given to His transcendence. God
with us and in us and working in all creation, even the Holy Spirit of God,—this is the conception
which the Indian Christian will elaborate and illuminate beyond anything that the West has
thus far attempted.

There is danger, today, and it is inevitable, that missionaries from the West be too ambitious
to occidentalize the native Christian community, ignorant of, or indifferent to, the grand
possibilities of thought and of life which lie in Eastern character and teaching. It is much
easier to thrust upon them everything Western than it is to appreciate and to conserve many
things Eastern. The future missionary will learn wisdom from the past and will enter upon his
work with less depreciation of things Oriental and with a larger desire to conserve to the
utmost Eastern habits of thought and social customs, so long as, and so far as, they can be
made the vehicles of Christian thought and the channels of Christian life. Herein must lie
the best means for a speedy coming of the Kingdom of Christ in India.

                                Chapter V.

THE WOMEN OF INDIA.

The condition of its women is the truest test of a people’s civilization. Her status is her
country’s barometer.

The one hundred million women of India admirably reflect the whole social and religious condition
of that land. There are more nations in India than are found in all Europe; they also present
a greater diversity of type. Between the aboriginal tribes which treat the weaker sex only
as a beast of burden, and the Parsee community which holds its women in the highest consideration
and furnishes them with a liberal education and large opportunity, there are many intermediate
tribes and nations which regard their women with varying degrees of consideration and of contempt.

Of all Scriptures the Zend Avesta of the Parsees is the only one which furnishes woman, from
the beginning, with absolute equality with man; and that position she has never lost among
the Parsees. But the Parsees in India are a mere handful.

The Hindu woman constitutes four-fifths of the total number of her sex in India; and her condition
is fairly uniform everywhere and conforms, in varying degrees, to a type whose characteristics
are easily recognized. She has come down from earliest history. We recognize her everywhere
in the pages of their ancient literature, in their laws and legends; and we behold her in all
the manifold walks of modern life. For nearly a quarter of a century the writer has lived as
her neighbour, gazed daily upon her life, wondered at and admired her many noble traits which
have been preserved under the most adverse circumstances, and grieved over her weakness and
her many disabilities.

In ancient times, the position of woman in India was one of power coupled with honour. Today
the power remains, but the honour has been largely eliminated.

1. In ancient Vedic times woman enjoyed many distinctions and revealed great aptitude. She
joined her husband in the offering of domestic sacrifices and sat as queen in the home. Some
of the sacred hymns of the Rigveda were made by her and have come down these thirty centuries
as a beautiful testimony to her intellectual brightness and aspiration, and as an evidence
of the honour in which she was held. For instance, we read of the Svayamvara of the lovely
princess Draupadi. It was the occasion when she had attained womanhood and was entitled to
the right to choose her own husband. How graphically are the royal suitors described as they
press their claims to her heart and hand in knightly tournament. It is one of those scenes
which reveal woman in the possession of some of her most queenly rights and attractions.

The ancient ideals of womanly character have come down the centuries writ large in their songs
and annals; and these ideals are today held as dearly, and are loved and sung with as much
ardour, as at any time in the history of India.

Every boy and girl of that land, today, knows the lovely Sita, wife of the noble and heroic
Rama,—how, while in the power of the terrible Ravana, and at risk of life, she withstood every
temptation and lived in unspotted purity and in supreme devotion and faithfulness to her royal
lord.

Who does not know of the faithful Saguntala, whose legend is woven into one of the most beautiful
and touching love stories the world has ever known. This drama was the first translation from
Sanskrit into the English tongue and elicited the astonishment and lively admiration of such
a man as Goethe.

India has always boasted of the constancy and devotion of the beautiful Savitri to her beloved
Sattyavân. After the death of her husband, she followed his soul into the spirit-world with
fearless devotion and pleaded with the King of Death with so much passion and persistence for
his return to life that he was finally restored to her in youthful vigour.

These are some of the stock illustrations of the model wife used everywhere and at all times
in India. And they have had an extensive and wonderful influence in the molding of wifely ideals.

It is, as we see, a glorification of devotion, faithfulness, constancy—traits that have always
beautified the character of the Hindu woman. It is true that, apart from her husband and from
the kitchen, woman has had few ideals urged upon her in that great country. Her ambitions have
not crossed the doorsteps of her house and home. She is measured entirely by her relation to
her husband or children. She is her lord’s companion and servant. Love to him is the wand which
alone can transform her life into gold. Her usefulness and her glory are the reflections of
his pleasure and of his satisfaction in her. She has no separate existence. Apart from man,
she is an absolute nonentity. And yet, within the sphere which has been granted to her, she
has shone with a wonderful radiance and with a charm which reminds us often of some of Shakespeare’s
beautiful womanly creations.

The physical attractions of woman have always, of course, captivated the sterner sex in India,
as in other lands. Her beauty is lavishly described and painted in warm colours through all
Hindu literature. And she is physically beautiful; she will compare favourably with the fair
ones of any land in womanly grace, in beauty of figure, and in bewitching charm of manner.

But the standard of womanly grace and beauty is not precisely the same there as it is with
us in the West. A Hindu and an American have different ideals of personal beauty. Though the
Aryan type of countenance may not largely differ East and West, there are touches of expression
and shades of beauty which correspond respectively to the different ideals in both lands. May
they not have created the ideals themselves?

The most common results of a Hindu woman’s toilet are the smooth hair, the blackened eyebrow,
the reddened finger-nails, the pendent nose jewels, the bulky ear-rings, the heavy bangles
for ankles and arms. Without these, life, to the Hindu belle, is not worth living. On wedding
occasions, among the common folk, red ochre is also daubed over the throat in ghastly suggestion
to the Westerner; but in glorious attractiveness to the native of the land!

West and East associate a fair complexion with highest beauty. A fond Hindu mother once came
to the writer moaning that she could not find a husband for her daughter because she was “too
black!” The young man of India puts a premium upon every shade of added lightness of complexion.
His taste is reflected in the universal feminine custom of using saffron dye to lighten the
complexion upon all festive occasions.

The clothing of the woman of India is exceedingly attractive. Her pretty garb sets off admirably
the beauty of her person; and, both in inexpensiveness and grace, and in its contribution to
health, is far better than the complicated extravagance, the heavy encumbrance and the insanitary
tight-lacing of the West. The women of South India dress with a view to comfort in the tropics;
but they have also, in a most remarkable degree, conserved appropriateness, beauty, and simplicity
in their robes. The possibilities of the one cloth, which is the full dress of the South Indian
woman, as a modest garment and as a charming full-dress equipment would be a revelation to
the much dressed votary of the West. In the arranging of this cloth there is considerable scope
for ingenuity and for æsthetic taste; although, in this matter, the rules of each caste furnish
an iron etiquette which must be followed by the women. Indeed, the tyranny of Worth in the
West is nothing as compared with caste tyranny as the Fashioner of the East. This is accounted
for by the fact that a woman’s dress must be arranged in such a way as to publish abroad her
caste affiliations.

Woman has a vast influence upon the life of the people of India. In no other country has she
relatively exercised more power. All this, notwithstanding the fact that, for more than twenty
centuries, she has had no recognized position in religion or in society. Her spiritual destiny
has been entirely in the hands of man. By the highest authorities her salvation has been made
entirely dependent upon her connection with him. She has absolutely no right of worship of
her own. From the cradle to the grave she is in man’s keeping. Until she is married, supreme
obedience to her father is her only safety; while her husband lives, heaven’s blessings can
come to her only through his favour and prayer; and, after his death, her sons become her lords
and the sole guardians and protectors of her spiritual interests. All this is everywhere recognized
by Hindu society, and by none more than by the woman herself.

And yet, it is equally true, and a fact of remarkable significance, that, in India today, the
religious influence of woman is paramount. She is the stronghold of Hinduism at the beginning
of this twentieth century. Man, under the growing influence of western thought, civilization,
and faith, has largely lost his moorings and is growing increasingly insincere and a trifler
with religious beliefs and institutions. The woman, on the other hand, is a conservative of
the conservatives. In her superstition she is deeply sincere; her faith has no questionings,
and her piety shapes her every activity. Were it not for the women of India, Hinduism, with
all its vaunted philosophy, its wonderful ritual and its mighty caste tyranny, would, within
a decade, fall into “innocuous desuetude.”

It is a significant fact that in the religion of no other people on earth does the worship
of the female find so prominent a place. In many parts of the land Sakti worship, or the worship
of goddesses, is widely prevalent and almost paramount in influence. It is really the worship
of power under a female form; and the power which these goddesses exercise is mostly malevolent
in its character. The terrible wife of Siva, in all her dread manifestations, is the most popular
deity, because the most feared in the land.

It is natural to inquire whether this characteristic of the Hindu pantheon is not a reflection
of the Hindu mind as to the influence of woman, and as to the belief of man in the evil character
of that influence. As is the place and power of woman among the men so is the character and
place of the goddesses in the pantheon of that people.

The famous religious reformer Chunder Sen, though he adopted and used the Lord’s Prayer, changed
the form of address from the masculine to the feminine and said, “Our Mother who art in heaven!”
The adoration of the female in Hindu worship was never more marked than at present. What has
Christianity to meet this bent of the Hindu mind? Or should it be discouraged as an element
in worship? The Romanists meet it by exalting and giving preëminence to the Virgin Mother.
The Protestants have nothing corresponding to this.

Socially, the Hindu woman is a reactionary of the most pronounced type; she opposes social
reform at all points—nowhere more than when it is directed to ameliorate her own condition.
Religiously, as we have seen, she is the slave of man by law and teaching; yet she rules her
household, even in these matters, with an iron hand.

From her throne in the home she so wields her sceptre that it is felt also throughout the whole
social fabric. Her beloved lord has perhaps passed through a university course, is a pronounced
social reformer and discourses in eloquent English, before large audiences of his admiring
countrymen, concerning the mighty social evils which are the curse of the country; he, with
his ardent fellow-reformers, frames rules which shall soon usher in the millennium of social
reform and progress! And then he—this man of culture, of eloquence, of noble purposes and of
altruistic ambitions—goes to his home and meekly submits to the grandmotherly tyranny which
has shaped his life much more than he knows, and which vitiates and renders nugatory all his
social and other schemes! As man has narrowed the scope of woman’s life in that land, so she
has given it intensity of power.

And what is more significant, she has become supremely contented with the narrow sphere which
man has grudgingly given her. And, for this very reason, she combats every endeavour, on the
part of her friends, to release her from her bondage and to increase her opportunities and
blessings in life. The old triple slander perpetrated upon India, to the effect that “it is
a country in which the women never laugh, the birds never sing and the flowers have no fragrance,”
is a falsehood in all its details. Hindu women have as merry a laugh as their sisters in any
other land. They have learned to make the best of their lot and to rejoice in it.

Since the time of the Mohammedan conquest, and probably long before, the higher class of women
have mostly led a life of seclusion. This is preëminently true of the northern parts of the
country where Mohammedan influence was strongest and the Hindu had carefully to protect his
wife and daughters from the coarse Mussulman. In South India this seclusion is very rare and
observed only among the most aristocratic. The common woman of India finds ample freedom of
intercourse in her town and village, and figures conspicuously at the great religious festivals
of her land.

Generally speaking, woman is the redeeming feature of India. She is the ideal home-keeper and
housekeeper. Usually, she is devoted to her husband, a passionate lover of her children, the
conserver of society, the true devotee in religion. Her lord and husband has been taught, from
time immemorial, to keep her in obscurity and to surround her with the screen of ignorance
and narrow sympathies; but she has magnified the work assigned to her; her excellence has shown
far beyond his; and, in her bondage, she has built her throne from which she has wielded her
sceptre of love and goodness over him.

She has never aspired to realms not granted to her by her lawgivers. The modern aspiration
of the “new woman” of the West does not appeal to her. She asks only to be let alone in her
narrow but, to her, all-sufficient sphere.

2. But, after all we have said, or can say, of the power of woman in India, it still remains
that, in no other land, has she suffered such marked disability and deeper injustice. If her
goodness has shone out of her darkness, it has only served to reveal the more the sadness of
her position. She bears in her condition the signs of her bondage and humiliation. The evils
of the land have been attributed to her; and man too often ascribes his own degradation and
sin to the curse breathed upon him by woman.

The proverbs of a country are the truest test of its sentiments. What have these to say of
the woman of India today?

“What poison is that which appears like nectar? Woman.”

“What is the chief gate to hell? Woman.”

“What is cruel? The heart of a viper. What is more cruel? The heart of a woman. What is the
most cruel of all? The heart of a soulless, penniless widow.”

“He is a fool who considers his wife as his friend.”

“Educating a woman is like putting a knife in the hands of a monkey.”

These are a few of the many proverbs which characterize woman in one vernacular only. Every
other Indian tongue equally abounds in proverbial expressions which brand a woman as one of
the greatest evils of the land. Sanskrit writers have exhausted vituperative language in describing
woman. They represent her as “wily, hypocritical, lying, deceptive, artful, fickle, freakish,
vindictive, vicious, lazy, vain, dissolute, hard-hearted, sinful, petty-minded, jealous, addicted
to simulation and dissimulation. She is worse than the worst of animals, more poisonous than
the poison of vipers.”

These proverbs do not necessarily reveal the depravity of the Hindu woman; but they do testify
unmistakably to the estimation in which she is held by man.

The ignorance of woman there is dense and is probably a fact which closely connects her with
the proverbial expressions concerning her. Her illiteracy is not an incident in Indian life.
It has been, through the centuries, a settled policy of the land. At the present time only
one woman in two hundred can read and write in that land of progress. The remarkable thing
is, not that so many are illiterate, but that even a few have been taught at all, in view of
the attitude of the Hindu mind towards her. In ancient times there was little to learn, in
India, apart from religion; but it has been the strict injunction of their Shastras and religious
instructors that no man shall, under penalty of hell, teach to his wife or daughter the Vedas
which are the purest and best part of Hindu Scriptures. Any form of useful knowledge was considered
dangerous in her possession.

It is not that woman is wanting in capacity. She is as bright and as teachable as her brother.
All that she has needed, educationally, has been opportunity; and this, society has denied
her, and this has done injustice not only to her but, still more, to itself.

Infant marriage has been, for many centuries, a crying evil in that land. This has brought
to woman a train of evils which have made deplorable her condition above all the women of the
earth. This custom originated, probably, from a sense of kindness to the girl herself. It was
the expression of a desire on the part of the parents to insure their daughter, at an early
date, against failure to attain that which all Hindus regard as the summum bonum of a woman’s
life—marriage. But, in their short-sighted policy, they failed to realize the myriad evils
which would follow this pernicious custom. The girl’s will or desire must not be regarded as
an element in this life compact! And, what is worse still, these infant compacts are necessarily
followed by early consummation, whereby girls enter, in many cases, upon the duties of motherhood
at twelve years of age. Few, indeed, are permitted to reach full physical development before
they assume the function of child-bearing. This is not only a serious evil to the woman herself,
it also gives poor chance for the begetting of a healthy progeny and for the early training
of the same. And it is not strange that the woman who thus early enters the sphere of motherhood
should become a worn out old woman at thirty-five or forty years.

Much effort has been put forth in India, by Westerners especially, to make infant marriages
impossible, or at least unpopular. But, little success has thus far attended this effort.

A small meed of alleviation was gained with much effort in 1891. It came through the passing
of the “Age of Consent Bill” whereby the age of a girl’s consent to cohabitation was raised
from ten to twelve. To a Westerner, the blessing acquired by this bill seems in itself a mockery
and only reveals the appalling cruelty of that people to its girls.

It has been found impossible to touch, much less remove, the gross evil of infant marriage
itself, the custom which opens wide the door to other ghastly evils.

The greatest of these is that of virgin-widowhood. If men will perversely marry their infant
daughters to small boys, it is sure that a considerable proportion of the boys will die before
their marriage is consummated. Thus, annually, thousands of these poor girls, who are in absolute
ignorance of the situation, are converted into virgin widows whose condition, upon the death
of their husbands, is instantly changed from one of innocent childhood pleasure into a sad,
despised and hated widowhood. For, the parents of the boy sincerely believe that it is her
evil star which has killed the boy whose destiny was blended with her own. And henceforth she
is regarded, not only by the parents concerned, but by society in general, as an accursed person,
hated for what has happened to her husband, and also a creature to be shunned. Her presence
must not be allowed on any festive occasion, lest its evil influence bring sorrow and death
to others. Thus a child of four or five years may suddenly have her prospects blasted, her
life embittered and her company shunned by the whole world, with none to befriend, to cheer
or to comfort her. There are two millions of such sad and injured ones in India today. Their
cry goes up to God and to man in inarticulate appeal for relief and redress against a social
custom and a religious rule which consigns them, in their time of greatest innocency, to a
life which is worse than death itself and which robs them of the protection, love and sympathy
which the whole economy of heaven and earth should guarantee to them.

Coupled with this terrible fact is the other, that woman must marry in India anyhow. No disgrace
and misfortune can befall a woman, according to Hindu ideas, equal to that of spending her
whole life in maidenhood. This, of course, is connected with the idea that she has no social
status or religious destiny apart from man. Hence it is that a host of loving parents, who
are unable to find a suitable match for their daughters, rather than leave them unmarried,
stupidly join them in wedlock to professional bridegrooms. There is, in Bengal, today, a division
of the Brahman caste whose men are professional purveyors to this silly but prevalent superstition.
They are prepared to marry any number of girls at remunerative rates. And thus they acquire
a fair income. Each of these men have scores of such wives and entertains the proud satisfaction,
doubtless, that he is bestowing a favour upon a benighted community by coupling his name in
wedlock with unfortunate girls who otherwise would be without a name or hope among men! A state
of society which renders such a condition of things possible is not only a disgrace to any
community, it is a monstrous evil against the womanhood of that community. Is it any wonder,
then, that so many of the women of India, under these circumstances, should commit suicide?
Is it strange that a wife, in such a land, should find it best to obey and submit to the indignities
of the worst kind from her husband? And is it remarkable that the Hindu widow, rather than
endure the neglect, the temptations and the obloquy of her widowhood, should have preferred
to practice Suttee and to end her miseries upon the funeral pyre of her husband? When we remember
that their system consigns one-fifth of all the women of India—more than 20,000,000 souls—to
this despised and ostracized widow class, we realize the depth of evil which flows from the system.

There is still another cruel injustice inflicted upon the womanhood of India. Many thousands
(there are 12,000 in South India alone) of her daughters are dedicated in infancy to a life
of shame in connection with temple worship in that land. These women, the so-called “servants
of the gods,” have been mostly dedicated by fond mothers to this wretched life as a thank offering
to the gods for blessings received. This seems very strange when it is known that all such
girls thereby become public characters. The “Dancing Girl” of India is thus shut up to her
evil life by those who love her most; and her religious profession becomes to her the highway
to perdition and a bitter curse to society. Recent effort has been made, in Bombay, to save
such girls by making it a legal offence to “marry” them to the gods and thus devoting them
to a life of shame. But this law only refers to the dedication of girls of tender age in Bombay.
It is exceedingly sad that, practically, the whole population is utterly indifferent to this
greatest insult committed against the womanhood of India and to the coupling of their own religion
and their gods with the ruin of the soul and body of many thousands of the daughters of the land.

It is not remarkable, under these circumstances, that among all the people of India the birth
of a daughter is the most unwelcome of domestic events. The evils which surely await her, and
the greater possibilities of sorrow and suffering which surround her, the great burden of expense
and of trouble which her training, and especially her marriage, will entail upon the family—all
combine to make her birth a much dreaded event.

The large expense, in the shape of the marriage dowry and the wedding expenses which have to
be incurred among nearly all classes in connection with the disposal of their daughters, only
make this situation the more emphatic.

The practice of infanticide, so extensively found in India, was the direct result of this difficulty.
For instance, among the noble race of Rajputs in North India it was found, some years ago,
that, in a community of 30,000, there was not a single girl! Every daughter that was born was
killed. The higher the rank of the family the more constant and systematic was the crime. “Thus,
while an unmarried daughter in India is looked upon as hopelessly disgraced, a son-in-law cannot
always be found unless the father of the girl is prepared to pay highly, and the marriage of
a daughter may mean the ruin of a family. Rather than incur this danger, the Rajput preferred
that his daughter should perish. And though the government has enacted stringent laws against
this custom, it is not entirely eradicated yet.”(10)

Thus the Hindus have wittingly and unwittingly placed many of the most serious disabilities
of life upon their women. And the greatest evil of it is that the woman has become so hardened
to her lot that, like the prisoner of Chillon, she has become enamoured of her chains and is
most loathe to part with her bondage.

3. But the dawn of a new day has risen upon India. It is the day of woman’s emancipation. A
new spirit, during the past century, has entered that land, and the welcome era of brighter
blessing, greater appreciation and larger opportunity for woman has actually begun. One has
only to study the laws which, during the nineteenth century, were enacted in India with a view
to removing the terrible evils and crimes which were committed under the sanction of Hinduism;
and he will find that not a few are directed towards the amelioration of the condition of woman.
Such inhuman customs as suttee, the murder of children, the dedication of girls to lives of
shame—these have been removed in whole or in part; and, by the “Age of Consent Bill” and other
similar half measures, the beginning has been made in introducing a day of better things for
the women.

Many of the efforts of Hindu Social Reformers are directed towards the removal of some of the
disabilities under which woman lives. It is true that the woman of India cannot expect, for
a long time, much help from her own people. Even the Social Reformers among them are so few
in number, are so half-hearted in their measures, and are so unwilling to deny themselves in
behalf of the cause which they advocate, that little can be expected from them. And yet, it
must be said that in a few matters of importance Hindu sentiment is slowly moving in the right
direction. As a Social Reformer, the Hindu is a poor success; but he is not a fool; he can
see that the situation, so far as woman is concerned, is becoming increasingly untenable and
flagrantly inconsistent with the growing light of today. The hope is that he will yield, with
increasing readiness, to the pressure brought to bear upon him by Western sentiment.

The presence of many women of the West in that land has been a standing rebuke to the Hindu
social situation. These women have done not a little to stir within their Eastern sisters a
desire for something better. They open their eyes to the contrasted conditions of the women
of the East and of the West. When they shall have aroused the women of India to the desperateness
of their condition and to the urgent need of reform and relief, the battle will be more than
half fought and victory will be in view. For, when the Eastern woman herself will vigorously
demand her emancipation, man will yield it to her. The Dufferin Hospitals are a noble tribute
to the active interest of the good lady whose name they bear; and the sympathetic endeavour
of Lady Curzon for the elevation of India’s women are but suggestive of considerable work which
the fair sex of the West have rendered and are rendering in behalf of their Indian sisters.

Protestant Christian missions have been pioneers in this great movement towards the emancipation
of the women of India. American and English women, connected with these missions, have given
themselves to the redemption of their sisters. More than one thousand of these good women are
devoting their lives to the salvation of India through the elevation of the women of the land.
Thousands of schools are conducted by them in which a host of young girls are receiving that
training which Hinduism has proscribed for many centuries. And through these schools, and by
means of at least two thousand Bible Women, trained by them, they have access into hundreds
of thousands of Hindu homes where they reveal to the women and girls a broader horizon of life
and give a new conception of the privileges and opportunities which are opening today before
them. They are creating among the women a spirit of unrest which is the dawning of a new ambition
for greater things in life and service. The very presence of these foreign ladies suggests
to their Indian sister a new sphere broader than the home, and a new opportunity pregnant with
rich blessings to the land.

Under the influence of these missionary efforts and of the less thorough training given in
government schools, Hindus themselves are beginning to bestir themselves and to establish schools
for their daughters; and thus we trust that coming years will not only witness a change of
thought among Hindus concerning women, but also a new line of indigenous activity for their
elevation.

There is further ground for encouragement; for the Hindu man of culture is growing increasingly
sensitive to the wide gulf which lies between him and his absolutely untrained wife. He sees
that, while the Western woman is suited in every way to become the companion of, and a helpmeet
to, her husband, his own little wife is fit to be neither. Even when not separated from him
by a disparity of many years in age, he finds that she has absolutely no interest outside the
walls of her home and has not the first qualification to discuss with him or to help him by
advice in any matter pertaining to his work or profession. So he, under the new light of modern
times, is increasingly ambitious to have a wife of the new training and of the larger horizon,
and is willing to pay a premium for her in marriage. And this, itself, is beginning to create
a market for educated women even in that stronghold of conservatism, the Brahman caste.

Thus the effort of Christian missions in the development of womanhood is acting like leaven
upon the whole social mass.

                               Chapter VI.

THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN EFFORT IN INDIA.

Christianity found very early entrance into India. How early we cannot definitely say. The
Syrian Church of Malabar traces its legendary origin to the “doubting disciple,” by whose name
it loves to be called. The Romish Church also warmly supports this contention and exalts St.
Thomas to a high place as the Patron Saint and Apostle of India.

Careful historical investigation entirely overthrows this old claim. The Thomas legends probably
owe their existence to the natural desire of the Syrian Christians to connect their history
with Apostolic origin and sanction. The name may also be confounded with a later Thomas, several
of whom were conspicuous in the annals of the India Syrian Church.

The ancient vagueness of the name “India,” has also, doubtless, had no little influence in
the formation of these legends. In the beginning of the Christian era “India” was a term of
much wider application than at present. It included several countries in Southwestern Asia,
and even a portion of Africa. While St. Thomas may therefore have laboured and died in “India,”
it does not at all follow that his field of labour was within the limits of the peninsula now
called by that name. Indeed, many historical incidents and facts agree in disproving Apostolic
connection with the rise of Christianity in India.

Pantænus, the saintly and learned Presbyter and Christian philosopher of Alexandria and the
renowned teacher of the illustrious church fathers, Clement and Origen, is the first honoured
name which finds historic sanction in the grand roll of Christian missionaries to India. He
visited Malabar, South India, during the last decade of the second century. He was a man wonderfully
equipped by deep spiritual insight and piety and also by philosophic training and metaphysical
acumen to become the messenger of Christian truth and life to the Buddhists and Brahmans who
lived side by side in South India in those days.

We know little of his work in that land. He found in Malabar a colony of Jewish Christians
who possessed a copy of the Gospel of Matthew in the Hebrew tongue, said to have been given
to them by the Apostle Bartholomew. It is not known, however, whether this last named apostle
laboured among these Christians in that region.

Probably a century later that Christian community formed connection with Antioch, Syria, which
was the first of all Christian missionary centres; but which, through its Nestorian faith,
soon lost its missionary ardour.

1. And thus emerges out of the darkness into its long and unique history the Syrian Church
of Malabar.

It has passed through many vicissitudes and has lost much, if not all, of its positive Christian
influence and missionary character. During a recent visit to that region I was saddened by
the sight of this Christian community which had lived all these centuries in the centre of
a heathen district with apparently no concern for the religious condition of the surrounding,
non-Christian, masses—content to be as a separate caste without religious influence upon, or
ambition to bring Christ into the life of, its benighted neighbours.

This church has survived its own apathy, on the one side, and Roman Catholic inquisition on
the other, and appears before the world as what it really is—the only indigenous Christian
Church in the peninsula of India. It enjoys the unique distinction of having lived more than
a millennium and a half in a heathen land, for a thousand years of which it was entirely surrounded
by a non-Christian people.

During the last half century it has been considerably influenced by the work and example of
the Church Missionary Society which is established in that region. Through this influence a
Reformed Syrian Church has come into existence which promises to do much for the whole community
in ideals and life. The Syrian Church has hitherto been greatly cursed with the trinity of
evils—ignorance, ceremonialism and superstition. It was not until 1811 (at the suggestion of
an Englishman) that it translated a part of the Bible (the four gospels) into the vernacular.
And this is the only translation of the Scriptures ever made and published by the natives of India.

The Syrian Church now numbers 248,741. That part of the Syrian community which the Romish Church
compelled, by the inquisition, to unite with it numbers 322,586.

2. From the fourteenth century the ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH has continued to send out her emissaries
and missionaries to that land.

Jordanus and his brave band of missionary associates were her first representatives.

But it was only from the arrival of Vasco da Gama and the Portuguese conquest four centuries
ago, that the influence of that Church began to be seriously felt and its triumphs recorded.

By the sword and cruel Inquisition not only were Syrian Christians compelled to transfer their
allegiance to the Pope; non-Christians also were, for perhaps the second time in the long history
of the land, subjected to the bitter restraints and inhuman inflictions of religious persecution.
It is a curious fact that the hideous and bloody monster of religious intolerance was hardly
known in India until, first, the followers of Mohammed and, secondly, the disciples of the
meek and lowly Jesus began to invade the land.

Then follow the devoted and heroic labours of the saintly Xavier. He was a man of princely
extraction, of royal bearing, of Christian devotion and self-denial. He wrought, according
to his light, with supreme loyalty to his Lord and with a divine passion for souls in South
India. Many thousands of the poor fishermen on the coast was he permitted to baptize into the
Christian faith. It is much to be regretted that, like nearly all subsequent Romish missionaries,
he gave himself, all but exclusively, to the ceremonial salvation, rather than to the ethical
transformation and the spiritual regeneration, of the people. It has always been a much easier
thing, in India, to gather the people for the reception of the mystical ordinances of our faith
than it has been to prepare them, by patient teaching and guidance, to exemplify its precepts
by their lives.

After Xavier came the accomplished and wily Jesuit, Robert de Nobilibus—the nephew of Cardinal
Bellarmine. A believer in the Jesuitical principle that the end justifies the means, and ardently
desiring to bring the Brahmans over to his faith he proclaimed himself, and in every way assumed
the rôle of, “the Western Brahman.” He lived scrupulously as a member of that haughty caste
and, until recalled by the Pope on account of his deception, wielded much influence over the
Brahmanical hierarchy in Madura.

Men of great power and supreme devotion to their faith followed as representatives of that
great Church in India. Such names as de Britto, Beschi, the Abbe du Bois are a crown of honour
to that community. Many like them spent lives of great self-denial for the cause of Christ
and faithfully wrought for the redemption of the people; so that at present the power of the
Romish Church and the devoted energy of its leaders are known in every section of the Peninsula.
After nearly six centuries of effort its community in India has reached the total of 1,524,000
souls. For a long time, it has not enjoyed much increase in its membership. In many places
it finds numerous accessions; but not a few of its people backslide and return to their ancestral
faith. The marked defects of Romanism in that land have been its concessions to, and compromise
with, the religion of the land both on the side of idolatrous worship and of caste observance.
I have discussed the subject with Indian Roman Catholics in the villages and find that to them
the worship of saints, through their many obtrusive images, is practically the same as the
idolatry of the Hindus—the only marked difference being in the greater size of the Romish images!
In like manner the Jesuit has adopted and incorporated into his religion, for the people of
that land, the Hindu caste system with all its hideous unchristian divisions. All this makes
the bridge which separates Hinduism from Roman Catholic Christianity a very narrow one; and
it reduces to a minimum the process of “conversion” from the former faith to the latter. But
an easy path from Hinduism to Christianity means an equally facile way of return to the ancestral
faith. If the Hindu has little to surrender in becoming a Christian, neither has such a Christian
any serious obstacle to prevent his return to Hindu gods and ceremonies when it suits his convenience
to do so. Hence it is that the new accessions to Romanism hardly exceed the number of those
who leave it in order to resume their allegiance to the faith of their fathers.

3. PROTESTANT MISSIONARY EFFORT began late. In India it was introduced with the Dutch conquest
in the early part of the seventeenth century. But the proselytizing methods of the Dutch in
those days savoured too much of the Romish inquisition under the Portuguese. When the pressure
of religious compulsion by the civil government was removed, consequent upon the English conquest
in Ceylon and India, the people apostatized in a body.

(a) It was not until the truly Christian King, Frederick IV. of Denmark, took, himself, a religious
interest in that land at the beginning of the eighteenth century, and sent, at his own expense,
the first two Protestant missionaries to Tranquebar on the east coast, that really consistent
Protestant effort for the redemption of India began.

Zeigenbalg and Plutschau, the two pioneers who were sent to Tranquebar, arrived in 1706. They
inaugurated the great work of Protestant Christianity for the spiritual regeneration of India,
and will always find an honoured place among the heroes of the cross.

Zeigenbalg was a man of great piety and of intellectual resources. He died in 1719 after a
most successful service of unremitting toil. He gathered hundreds of converts into the Christian
fold, established schools and erected a beautiful church edifice which stands today as the
oldest Protestant Mission Church in the East. Above all, he felt that an open Bible in the
vernacular was essential to the conversion of India; and he therefore gave himself to the translation
of God’s Word. He was not able to complete this work; it did not issue from the press until
1725. This Tamil version of the Bible was the first translation of God’s Word in India and
in all the East; and it stands today as a monument to his intelligent labours and to those
of his worthy successor, Schultze. It also represents the beginning of a new era of missionary
effort in the country. The Roman Catholics, during all their stay in that land have done nothing
towards giving to the people the Bible in their native tongue. It was not until the year 1857
that, stirred by Protestant example, they published their first and only translation of any
portion of God’s Word in any of the South India vernaculars—that of the Tamil Gospels and the
Acts of the Apostles.

Schultze spent fifteen years in Madras and left a congregation of 700 persons there. From Tranquebar,
as a centre, missionary effort spread extensively throughout the Madras Presidency. This was
done through German missionaries supported mainly by English funds furnished by the Society
for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge.

Perhaps the most commanding figure connected with that work and century was Frederick Schwartz,
the missionary statesman and apostle who arrived in India in 1750. His efforts extended throughout
the Kingdom of Tanjore and even to the Madura and Tinnevelly districts. Through all these regions
his power was felt and, in company with a few other worthy souls, he laboured with distinguished
faith, wisdom and heroism. The Protestant Native Church which has so flourished in Tinnevelly
and Madura found its origin and first success under his guidance. He spent forty-eight years
in unremitting effort, influenced powerfully all missionaries who came in contact with him,
and passed on to his reward in 1798.

Thus, before the close of the last century, at least 50,000 Tamilians had been baptized in
connection with this Protestant effort. When we bear in mind the fewness of the agents, and
the very limited tract of country which they occupied, it is a matter of considerable astonishment
that so many converts were every year baptized in the various missions. In Tranquebar alone,
in nineteen years, there were 19,340 persons baptized; and during the century, the entire number
of converts was nearly, if not quite, double this amount. In Madras, as many as 4,000 natives
were received into the Christian church. The Cuddalore Mission, notwithstanding its great troubles,
yielded between 1,000 and 2,000 converts; the Trichinopoly Mission, more than 2,000; the Tanjore
Mission, about 1,500; and the mission established at Palamcottah in Tinnevelly in 1785, also a few.

It is impossible to know exactly the number of the native Protestant Christian churches and
congregations existing at the beginning of the last century, or the number of the Christian
community in the Presidency.

Probably only a few thousand remained to await the dawn of the new century.

From Madras, down South as far as Palamcottah, infant Christian communities existed. But they
did not largely flourish until new missionary societies were organized and a larger force of
missionary workers were sent to strengthen and push forward the work established.

And it is very unfortunate that, with much good, not a little evil was found among these few
Christians whom the eighteenth century bestowed upon the nineteenth. Mr. Sherring truly says,—“That
many of the converts were sincere and genuine, we cannot doubt. Yet it is certain that the
permission to retain their caste customs and prejudices throws considerable suspicion on the
spiritual work accomplished among them. The Danish and German missionaries soon perceived the
formidable influence of caste as an opponent of the Gospel, unless they were ready, like the
Roman Catholics, to enlist it on their side, by permitting it to be retained in the Christian
churches established by them. They chose to make caste a friend rather than an enemy. In doing
this, however, while they made their path easier, they sacrificed their principles. They admitted
an element into their midst which acted on the Christian community like poison.” And this poison
is still exercising a potent influence upon a no small portion of the Protestant Native Church
in South India. A bad beginning in this respect has facilitated an evil continuance.

The closing years of the eighteenth century carry our interest to North India and are notable
as the beginning of the organized missionary effort of the English people for the redemption
of India.

(b) The Anglo-Saxons seem to have been the last among Christian peoples to awake from the lethargy
of a self-centred, self-seeking Christianity, and to enter upon the great missionary campaign
for the conquest of the world for Christ. It is true that the Society for the Propagation of
the Gospel received its first charter in 1701. But for more than a century of its history it
did not concern itself about carrying the Gospel to the heathen races. It seems strange that,
up to that time, both the Protestant clergy and laymen of Great Britain and America felt little
or none of that sense of obligation for the conversion of the non-Christian world to Christ
which has now become so universal a conviction and a passion among them.

In the work of rousing the English to this grand world-wide enterprise William Carey acquired
well-earned distinction. Though of humble origin and wanting in early training, his spiritual
vision and contagious enthusiasm made him a leader of power. Thus, God chose a cobbler youth
to lead the Christian hosts of England out of the bondage of narrow religious sympathies into
a world-wide conquest of souls for Christ. Carey’s efforts in England were unremitting, and
the contagion of his burning altruism spread everywhere notwithstanding much opposition and
contempt met from a certain class.

His early efforts at home were supplemented by a missionary life in India so remarkable in
its self-denying devotion, so characterized by distinguished ability and linguistic genius,
and so notable in wisdom and persistence under the greatest difficulties that his name will
ever stand preëminent in all the annals of missionary effort.

But it was very sad that, while Christian England was waking out of her lethargy to her spiritual
opportunities and duties in India, commercial England threw herself across the path and denied
the right of Christian service for the Christless people of that land.

Carey found no welcome or even permission to work in British India. He was compelled to flee
from the territory of the East India Company and to find refuge and opportunity for missionary
work under the more enlightened and progressive rule of the Danish in Serampore. It was from
that place that he directed his missionary effort in India and found the long-sought opportunity
to serve his Master in that heathen land. It was there that, in company with his worthy associates,
Marshman and Ward, he built up a Christian community and translated and published the Word
of God into many oriental tongues. The success and achievements of Carey would be regarded
as phenomenal in the case of any missionary. But when it is remembered that he was compelled
to support himself and his mission, in considerable part, through his income in secular pursuits;
when it is also known that his wife was, for many years, a wreck, mentally, and therefore a
source of great care and anxiety to him, how wonderful must have been his faith, his persistence,
his intellectual endowments and his love for the people of India to have led him to accomplish
so much for the cause of Christ in that great land!

Carey’s life and example wrought wonders in its influence upon others of his countrymen. Among
a noble band of followers is found the devout and pious enthusiast Henry Martyn who, during
his too brief career as a chaplain in India, found time to commend his Master and His Faith
to many in that land of darkness and death. Martyn was a worthy example of what a consecrated
chaplain can do for the Christian cause, beyond the strict performance of his priestly functions—an
example which was perhaps never more needed in India than at present when so wide a gulf is
found between the ordinary chaplain and the missionary.

As a result of this missionary revival there also came into existence not a few hopeful, vigorous
missionary societies. First among them was the London Missionary Society which entered, in
1795, upon its grand career of world-wide endeavour. After that, was organized (in 1799) the
Church Missionary Society. Both of these organizations, at the opening of the new century,
began to put forth their best energies for the salvation of India. Then a host of other lesser,
but equally determined, agencies followed in their train and made India their special field
of activity.

In addition to distinctively English societies there were organized, also, separate Scotch,
Irish and Welsh movements for work in the land—each nation vying with every other in the work
of upbuilding there the Kingdom of Christ.

Among the British societies the Church Missionary Society, the Society for the Propagation
of the Gospel, and the London Missionary Society have done most extensive service and have
been markedly blessed with growing communities and effective organizations for work among the
people.

Each nationality also represents a separate type of life and activity. The English missions,
for instance, are strong in their wise organization and effective administration. The Scotch,
on the other hand, have a genius for thoroughness in everything, especially in educational
work. The names of the greatest missionary educators of India are, almost without exception,
Scotch. They have dug deep foundations and have aimed, by means of their splendid schools,
to excel in the work of directing the thought of, and imparting a new philosophy to, the rising
generation of Indians. If their results have not been statistically impressive, so far as converts
are concerned, they have had preëminence in the task of transforming the thought and of leavening
the institutions of the land. For instance, Alexander Duff—the father of the higher educational
work of missions, a man mighty in thought and kindled with a sublime faith and a Christian
enthusiasm—did not number many converts as the result of his college training of the young.
But every convert under him counted for something in the Christian Church. It is said that,
of the forty-eight educated men who were won to Christ through his mission in 1871, nine were
ministers, ten were catechists, seventeen were professors and high-grade teachers, eight, government
servants of the higher grade, and four, assistant surgeons and doctors. Similar to the work
of Dr. Duff in Calcutta was the work of Dr. Wilson in Bombay and is the effort of Dr. Miller,
at present, in Madras. Mission results must be weighed as well as measured.

As a contrast to this thought-directing and leavening work of the Scottish Churches may be
placed the work of the Salvation Army in India. This unique organization invaded that great
land nearly a quarter of a century ago. Believing that existing missionary organizations and
methods of work were too dignified, staid and inadequate for best results, the leaders of this
movement introduced its cyclone methods and proposed to take India by storm. They began by
insisting upon all their European officers conforming to native custom, in clothing and diet.
Their appeal was simple even if their work was narrow and noisy. It was a call upon all to
immediate repentance and to a belief upon the Lord, Christ, for salvation. They ignored the
Sacraments of the Church and, for a while, even emulated the Hindus by daubing their religious
emblems upon their foreheads.

But their appeal fell flat upon a people who had no Christian heritage or training; and their
genuine forms of self-denial and methods of adaptation, instead of producing popular admiration
and attachment, soon produced pity and even contempt. If the officers were men of spiritual
ardour and were kindled with a passion for the salvation of India, they were also, on the whole,
untrained and uncultured. They not only disobeyed their Lord in neglecting the Sacraments,
they did not and could not understand the people and their religion. By ignoring all sanitary
rules many of them vainly sacrificed their lives to the Cause.

Considering the money expended, the precious lives sacrificed and the efforts exhausted during
this quarter of a century the results achieved by this organization have been painfully, though
not unexpectedly, small. It clearly illustrates and emphasizes the fact that India is not to
be won for Christ by a campaign of ignorance and noise, however largely it may be enforced
by altruistic fervour. And it should not be forgotten that the army officers have not scrupled
to enter territory already occupied by Christian missions, to cause unspeakable annoyance to
workers on the field, and to fill up more than half the ranks of their “soldiers” with people
who already claimed allegiance to Christ in connection with well-established missions.

(c) Australia has recently fallen into the ranks of those who carry the Gospel to India. One
Faith Mission in Western India is almost entirely conducted by men and women of that country.
A Baptist Mission also is maintained by them there. And not a few of the strong members of
British missions are Australians; these, with their work, are supported by the churches which
sent them forth.

(d) Protestant Europe has not been conspicuous for its missionary effort. And yet India owes
a large debt to the Christians of the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Sweden for their effort
to present to them the message of life. As we have seen, the Dutch, upon their first conquest
in the East, sought to introduce their faith among the people. The first Protestant missionaries
who gave their life for India were Danes. They were supported by the private resources of their
own king. In early times Danish settlements in India were the refuge of Gospel messengers to
that land. They protected them against the unchristian narrowness and persecution of the East
India Company. The Danish settlement of Serampore gave the only opportunity to Carey and his
associates for a home and for missionary work.

The Bible was the first time translated into an Indian vernacular (Tamil) by our Continental
brethren, and the first vernacular Christian books were printed in Germany.

At the present time they are giving themselves more fully than ever before to the work of India’s
redemption. There are eight Continental Missions conducted there, some of which have achieved
considerable success. The Leipzig Evangelical Lutheran Mission has fallen heir to the first
Danish mission established at Tranquebar. It has at present a strong force of workers, and
they are scattered through several Districts in South India, are doing solid and substantial
work and have gathered a numerous Christian community.

Perhaps the most successful of these European missions is the Basil German Evangelical Mission,
which is established upon the southwestern coast. It is well organized, has a thorough educational
system and is embued with a strong evangelistic spirit. Connected with this mission is an extensive
and prosperous Industrial Mission. With the German spirit of thoroughness they have developed,
more largely than any other mission in India, the industrial department, until it is now well
established and fully self-supporting.

All these European missions are systematic and painstaking in the work which they are carrying
forward. In some respects this gives them well-earned distinction. But, on the other hand,
they labour under a serious disability in having to acquire the English as well as the vernacular
of the people after arriving in the land. They are also extremely conservative, not to say
antiquated, in their methods; and they have not, in most cases, learned to hate and antagonize,
as they should, the terrible caste system of the country.

(e) The American participation in the Christian conquest of India began early. It was the perusal
of the Life of David Brainerd, the American missionary saint, which kindled the missionary
zeal of William Carey in England. On the other hand, the Life of Carey had no small influence,
at the beginning of the nineteenth century, in giving irresistible impulse and definiteness
of purpose to that noble band of American missionary pioneers—Mills and Nott, Newell and Judson.
And their consecrated enthusiasm and purpose to labour for the conversion of the heathen nations,
in its turn, led, in 1810, to the founding of the first foreign missionary society in the United
States—the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.

The first field chosen by this society for its activity was India. It represented to them both
the greatest need and the best opportunity for Christian work.

Thus the first organized attempt of the Christian Church of America to reach and to redeem
the heathen world was directed towards the land of the Vedas. And the first band of missionaries
which that, now venerable, Board sent forth into the harvest went, with eager anticipation
and earnest prayer, to that ancient and benighted people.

But how great must have been their disappointment and sorrow, upon their arrival, to be refused
permission by the Honourable East India Company to land in Calcutta. With sad hearts they turned
their faces towards Bombay, hoping that God would open the way to their entering upon missionary
service there. This again was denied them and they fled to Cochin, but were seized and brought
back to Bombay to await the arrival of an American ship to convey them home. It was just then
that their prayer was answered and the Lord of Hosts came to their succour and opened wide
the door of that land to the missionary labourer. A new charter was granted by the British
Parliament to the East India Company. In that, insistence was made that the Christian missionary
be permitted to prosecute his work for the heathen of that land unmolested. This charter was
granted in 1813, while the Americans were still held in durance in Bombay.

It was the Magna Charta of missions for India; and from that time until this the Christian
missionary has found permission to preach his message in that land. He has also enjoyed there
ample protection in the exercise of all his religious duties and work as a messenger of Christ.
By this charter missions received State sanction to obey heaven’s command, and missionaries
of all lands came to enjoy, on British territory in the East, the undisputed right to carry
the gospel of our Lord to heathen people.

The impatient little band of missionaries were therefore released at Bombay; and from that
day until this America has found joy in her effort to convey her spiritual blessings to that
land. Adoniram Judson, having become a Baptist, was directed by Carey to Burma where he laboured
for many years with apostolic zeal and with distinguished success. The nearly 150,000 native
Christians of Burma today owe their conversion largely to Judson’s wise initiative, resistless
energy, grand Christian faith and inspiring example.

Mills, who was the leader in the early band of students whose zeal led to the organization
of the American Board, found his field of service on the West coast of Africa, whence also
he was early called to his heavenly reward.

The saintly Harriet Newell, wife of another member of this distinguished company, died on the
Isle of France, and her sorrowing husband returned to Bombay and rejoined his brethren Hall
and Nott. These three, therefore, were the founders of this first American Mission in India—now
called the American Mahratta Mission. Bombay, Ahmednaggar and Sholapur are its principal centres
of work; and it covers a field whose population is between three and four millions. It has
had distinguished success and has gathered the largest native community among the Protestant
missions of Western India.

In 1834 the same society established its South India Mission at Madura. This was an offshoot
from the Jaffna Mission which was founded in 1815 in that northern corner of Ceylon. The Madura
Mission has prospered, has 18,000 in its Christian community, and is regarded as one of the
best organized missions in the country.

In 1834 the American Presbyterians, while yet connected with the American Board, established
in the Northwest their large and successful mission. Its centres of work are Lahore, Lodiana,
Futtegarh, Dera-Dun and Allahabad. This mission has done excellent work and has attained high
eminence among the missions of North India, both for its educational work, its leavening influence
and for its evangelistic zeal. A number of its missionaries suffered martyrdom during the terrible
Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. It was from that mission that the first call to universal prayer for
the conversion of the world was sent forth. And thus was founded the Week of Prayer which now
finds such general observance among Protestant Christians.

In 1836 the Baptists established for Telugu people, on the southeastern coast, the famous “Lone
Star Mission.” It has had such phenomenal success that, though established only in 1840 in
a purely heathen field, and notwithstanding the fact that the first twenty-five years of its
efforts were barren of outward results, it is to-day by far the largest mission in India, having
53,790 communicants and a community of 200,000. Its chief centres of work are Ongole and Nellore.

The Rev. Samuel Day was sent out by the society in 1835 to Chicacole, but in 1837 removed to
Madras. After three years’ labour there he resolved to establish a mission among the Telugu
people, and so removed to Nellore and commenced work there in March, 1840. The unproductiveness
of the work in the early history was such that the abandonment of the mission was several times
under consideration. But in 1866 prosperity dawned. Later followed the great accessions which
have, up to the present, continued in greater or less degree and which have been on a larger
scale than in any other field in South India. “The history of Christianity, in all ages and
countries, shows nothing which surpasses the later years of this mission in spontaneous extension,
in rapidity of progress, in genuineness of conversions, in stability of results or in promise
for the future.” The church organized with eight members by Dr. Clough at Ongole in 1867 numbers
now its thousands. The great famine of 1877 presented a large Christian opportunity which was
eagerly seized by Dr. Clough, himself a civil engineer, in the conduct of large famine relief
works under government and in the Christian instruction of many thousands who laboured under
him. This itself created a wonderful movement which has been marvellously used of God in the
conversion of the people. Nearly all of these converts have come from the lowest class of society.
But at present the higher classes are beginning to consider the claims of the Gospel. It is
natural that the most serious problem and principal concern of this mission has been to keep
pace with the movement, and to train suitable agents for the guidance and instruction of the
incoming thousands. It has also been largely blessed in this line, as its various and growing
institutions testify.

As the Madura Mission was the daughter of the Jaffna Mission so the Madras section of the Madura
Mission, in the year 1851, became the mother of a vigorous daughter. For the members of the
Scudder family—a family famed in missionary annals—were appointed to the District of Arcot,
some seventy miles south of Madras, and there began a work under the American Dutch Reformed
Church which has rapidly grown into power and promise.

In the year 1856 the Methodists of America entered upon their great work in that land. With
their wonted zeal and evangelistic fervour they carried forward a vigorous campaign in North
India. They early found an opening among the outcaste people as the Baptists had found among
the same in the South; and they eagerly entered the open door and vigorously prosecuted their
endeavours for that class. Their success has been signal. More than 100,000 people have been
gathered into their Christian community and an equal number of others are desirous to place
themselves under their spiritual care and guidance. They have also entered seriously into the
work of training an agency and of educating the densely ignorant members of their community.
In addition to their village schools they have a large theological and normal school, besides
two colleges, one of which is perhaps the best college for women in Northern India, if not
in the East. Their work has now spread to many parts of the land and even to Burma and the
Straits settlement. They have also wisely cultivated the press and the publishing department
as an important auxiliary in their work. In this department they are perhaps doing more than
any other society now at work in India.

The great success of this society in India is largely owing to the wise leadership of that
missionary statesman—Bishop Thoburn. I doubt whether many other missionaries, if indeed any
other, have wrought more for the redemption of that people than this sturdy American of ample
common—and uncommon—sense, of wide vision, of sublime faith and of masterful generalship.

Several divisions of the American Lutheran community have also wrought much for India and are
justly proud of their prosperous missions, especially in South India.

In like manner American “Faith Missions,” not a few, have planted the banner of the cross in
that land of the trident and are prosecuting their mission and proclaiming their message with
singleness of purpose and exemplary zeal. The “Christian Alliance” is the most pretentious
organization of this class which does work in that land. Its efforts are chiefly confined to
the Bombay Presidency where it has a goodly number of earnest workers.

Organizations for the young—the Y. M. C. A., Y. W. C. A., Y. P. S. C. E., S. V. M.,—while they
are not in any sense distinctly American, are nevertheless dominated by the American spirit
and methods, and are, to a large extent under the guidance of American youth. These Christian
movements are doing royal service for the Kingdom of Christ in that stronghold of error. They
bring cheer to the missionaries, youthful inspiration to the churches, a wide opportunity to
the young life of the Christian communities and a new pace to all the messengers of Christ
in the land. The Y. M. C. A. is also doing an excellent evangelistic work among the educated
non-Christian youth of India—a work that is appealing mightily to their deepest spiritual instincts
and is impressing them, as nothing else does, with the combined sanity and spirituality, the
reasonableness and the saving power of our faith.

I must also allude to that unique American Institution—the Haskell-Barrows lectureship—which
has already done no small good to the educated of the land, and has within itself the possibility
of largest blessing to the country. It was founded in connection with the University of Chicago;
and it appoints and sends to India once every two or three years a distinguished lecturer to
present the excellence of our faith in its philosophy and life in such a manner as shall best
commend it and appeal to the thoughtful non-Christians of the Orient. Every effort of this
kind which shall emphasize to Hindus the harmony of Christian truth and the best thinking of
our age and shall reveal to them Christ as the Redeemer and Exemplar of our race and as the
only “Name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved,” is to be cordially welcomed
among God’s best forces for India’s redemption. And America is to be congratulated because
she is the first to endow and to inaugurate such a helpful agency for the glory of God and
the salvation of India’s men of culture.

It is comforting to the American worker in India to be assured that the modern rulers of the
land are amply atoning for the unchristian and rude incivility of their predecessors in office
ninety years ago. For they not only cordially welcome the Christian worker from the States;
they also reveal full appreciation of his labours, render him every protection and are not
averse to praising him for his arduous endeavours. Listen to the words of Lord Wenlock, while
Governor of Madras,—“Our cousins in America,” he says, “are not, as we are, responsible for
the welfare of a very large number of the human race; but seeing our difficulties and knowing
how much there is to do, they have not hesitated to put their hands into their pockets to assist
us in doing that which is almost impossible for any government to achieve unassisted. They
go out themselves, their wives and their sisters; they enter into all parts of the country,
they send a very large amount of money and they spend their time and their health in promoting
the welfare of those who are in no way connected with them.... In all Districts I find our
American cousins joining with us in improving the system of education and in extending it wherever
it was wanted. To their efforts we owe a very great deal. It must be recognized that their
great object is the advancement of the Christian religion.”

Lord Harris, the Governor, of Bombay, a little more than a decade ago, also said publicly,
of the work of the American Board Mission among the Maharattas,—“I do not think I can too prominently
say that our gratitude towards this American Mission has been piling up and piling up all the
years of this century.”

4. Our record of the efforts of Christian countries in behalf of India were not complete without
a reference to the hearty coöperation of Protestant Canada in this work. Several missions have
been established there by Canadian Baptists and Presbyterians; and these are flourishing and
are adding daily to the number of those who are being saved.

Looking at the whole force of Protestant Christian missions in that land today we are impressed
with the magnitude of its organization, work and success. Nearly two and a half million dollars
are devoted annually by the Christians of the West to this work of saving this great one of
the East. It is a great financial investment, but not to be compared with that of the thousands
of choice men and women who go forth and give themselves unto death that they might enable
Christ to see of the travail of His soul and be satisfied among the millions of that land.

Comparing present missionary agency and methods in India with those of past ages it may be
well to consider the differences and gather therefrom assurance for the coming of the Kingdom
of our Lord in the East. These differences are numerous and radical. I need only refer to a
few of them:—

(a) The spell of an ecclesiastical, and the glamour of a ceremonial, Christianity is being
increasingly substituted by the moral and spiritual characteristics of our faith in that land.
The conversion of India is less and less regarded by Christian workers in the land as a change
from the ceremonial and ritual of the old, to those of the new, faith. Ever increasing emphasis
is given to the fact that to be a Christian is to live the Christ-life and to be loyal to Him
in all the ethical and spiritual teachings of the Sermon on the Mount. And these missionary
workers care less to touch the life of our converts on the surface and more to grip it at its
centre and to transform character. And this is a work which is most enduring in its results.

(b) Christian workers in India are learning mutual sympathy and appreciation in their work.
Instead of the old jealousies, suspicions, antipathies and misunderstandings of the past, there
is found a developing sense of oneness, of fellowship, of comity, amity and mutual helpfulness
among the missionaries of that land. The watchword of to-day is coöperation. The distracting
spectacle of a divided Christianity, of hated and mutually hating Christian sects in a heathen
land is surely passing away and the dawning of the day of peace and harmony and fellowship
in Christian work is upon us. And India will enjoy the wonderful results of this.

(c) The serious mistakes of method and standpoint in missions of former centuries are now avoided.
The compromise which they made with Hinduism in caste and in other matters is no longer possible
in Protestant missions. We know, as they could not, the irreconcilable antagonism of caste
to Christianity.

On the other hand we know Hinduism and other non-Christian faiths better than our fathers did.
We are not so anxious to trace all these back to Satanic origin. We are learning the sympathies
as well as the antipathies of religions. The translators of God’s Word into the vernacular
of India two centuries and one century ago largely avoided the use of popular terms because
they were popular and the common-vehicles of Hindu thought, which (they said) was of the devil.
We see the folly of such an avoidance and the need of using and rehabilitating the religious
terminology of the people that we may the more surely come into touch with them, and the more
easily convey to them the deepest truths of our faith. Formerly, missionaries declined to use
the music of Hinduism because it enriched the temple services and “was of the devil.” Today
these same sweet and plaintive songs are wedded to beautiful Christian hymns, prepared by native
Christian poets, and are the appropriate and very popular vehicles of the best Christian thought
and sentiment to Christian and non-Christian natives alike.

This only illustrates the fact that the Christian message and work are finding greater power
over the people because conveyed to them in more intelligible terms. It can come home to them
in their common life as it did not formerly.

(d) Educational work is increasingly utilized. Formerly missionary effort was mostly the work
of the preacher—it was the direct Gospel message and appeal. To this has been added the no
less necessary, indeed the deeper, work of transforming the thought of the land and of introducing
everywhere a Christian philosophy and a process of thinking which will undermine the old methods
and foundations of Hinduism. This Christian education, which is now being imparted in India
to nearly half a million youth in our schools, is a leavening power the extent of whose influence
no one can compute. And it carries within itself untold possibilities for the conversion of
India. By these institutions, Sir William Muir truly tells us, “the country has been inoculated
with Christian sentiment.”

Sir Charles U. Atchison declares that, in his judgment, “the value of educational missionary
institutions, in the present transition state of Indian opinion, can hardly be overrated. It
is more than ever the duty of the Church to go forward in its educational policy.”

In other ways also, medical and industrial, Christian work has broadened out so that it reaches
the people at all points and lifts up the Christian community into a self-respecting power
which will abide and grow in influence.

In modern missions the Word of God, translated into all the vernaculars of the people, has
become the mightiest instrument of progress in Christian life, and the most ubiquitous messenger
of Christian truth. The Bible was almost a sealed book to the people of India when William
Carey arrived at the close of the eighteenth century. The Roman Catholic and Syrian Christians
had done nothing to bring this blessing to the people. The Danish mission, as we have seen,
had translated it into the Tamil tongue. And that was all. How wonderful the work of the last
century whereby this blessed Word has been translated into every language and many dialects
of polyglot India. Among its 300,000,000 inhabitants there are few who cannot find God’s own
Word translated into their own speech, published and brought to their doors. Can any one realize
how great a leverage this is in the work of overturning that land religiously and in bringing
Christ into the life of India?

                                * * * * *

Thus the history of Christian effort in India has not been without its many lessons. And these
lessons have brought wisdom and, with that wisdom, confidence and growing efficiency to the
Christian forces now at work in the land.

For this reason the progress of the Kingdom of Christ in India will, during the present century,
be much more marked and its triumphs more signal than in the past centuries. And for this well-founded
assurance we thank God.

                               Chapter VII.

THE MISSIONARY.

The present missionary force in India represents, according to the “Indian Missionary Directory,”
a body of nearly 2,500 men and women who have been sent from Europe, America and Australia
to instruct the people in the blessings of our faith. This body is constantly increasing in
numbers and is sent forth and maintained by some seventy societies.(11) They are a noble band
of Christian workers, of no less consecration and faith than those in the past, and of the
highest training and broadest culture ever known.

The missionary furnishes to the home churches the chief interest in missionary work and is
the link which connects them and the home society with their enterprise abroad.

His work at present is not what it once was in India. In earlier days the missionary had to
be a man of all works; every form of missionary endeavour came under his direction. In mission
work, as in every other line of effort, specialization has become a feature and a necessity.
There must be men of as varied talents and special lines of training as there are departments
of missionary work. But every missionary should be preëminently, a man. He should be a man
of large calibre. There is much danger lest the church become indifferent to this matter, and
send to the mission field inferior men—men who would be unable to stem the tide of competition
and attain success at home. If a man is not qualified for success in the home land, there is
little chance of his attaining much usefulness upon the mission field. And an inferior class
of men sent out to heathen lands to represent, and to conduct the work of, the home church
must necessarily react upon the church through want of success, discouragement and defeat in
the missionary enterprise. A church whose missionary representatives abroad are wanting in
fitness and power cannot long continue to be a strenuous missionary church; it will lack fuel
to keep burning the fire of missionary enthusiasm.

And in speaking of the missionary I include the lady missionary. Missionary ladies today are
more numerous in India than are the men. More than a thousand single ladies have given themselves
to the missionary life and are labouring with conspicuous success in that land. They meet almost
the same conditions of life and require the same qualifications for success as their brother
missionaries do. Of course, in certain details, they differ; but into such matters I cannot
enter at present.

I desire to enumerate the qualifications of a missionary for highest usefulness in India at
the present time.

1. Physical Fitness.

Is a man physically qualified to be sent out into missionary work? For an enterprise like this,
where a man practically enlists for life, it is of much concern to the Society which appoints
him, and of great importance to the work which he is to take up that he be possessed of good
health. This is preëminently true in the case of all those who are appointed to India. The
climate of India is trying, though it is neither dangerous nor as fruitful in difficulty, as
many believe. It is not necessary that a man who is sent out to India be possessed of robust
health. Indeed, I have often noticed that the most robust are the most likely to yield, through
ill-health, to climatic influences there. This is chiefly owing to the fact that such people
are usually careless in all things pertaining to health. They place too much reliance upon
their stock of vigour, and ignore, until too late, the insidious influences of the tropical
sun. We ask not for a man of great bodily vigour; but he should be possessed of organic soundness.
Such a man may stand the climate longer and work with fewer interruptions than his more vigorous
brother; simply because he knows that his health is delicate and appreciates the necessity
of taking suitable care of himself. On the whole, my experience has led me to two convictions
about this matter; the first is that the less robust and more careful missionaries stand well
that tropical climate; and in the second place, that to those who do take adequate care of
themselves, the climate of India is neither dangerous nor insanitary.

There are, however, certain precautions which missionaries should take in that land in order
to insure the proper degree of efficient service. Annual periods of rest at hill “sanitaria”
are not only desirable, but are necessary, in order to preserve the health and add to one’s
usefulness. Many of the best missions in India, at present, not only arrange that their missionaries
take this rest, but demand it of them. They have learned by experience that it is a reckless
waste of precious power for their missionaries to continue working upon the hot plains until
compelled by a break-down to seek rest and restoration. It is much easier, in the tropics,
to preserve, than to restore, health. Many a noble service has been cut short, and many a useful
career has been spoiled by recklessly continuing work for a few years without rest or change
in that land. The youngest and the least organized missions, and consequently those which have
not perfected arrangements for the rest and health of their members, are those which have the
largest number of break-downs, and which lose most in labour and money on account of the ill
health of their missionaries.

Visits to the home land every eight or ten years are also desirable, not only for restoration
of physical vigour, but also, for a recementing of domestic and social ties and for a renewed
contact with and a new inspiration from the Church of God in the West. Life in all its aspects
has a tendency to degenerate in the tropics; and one needs occasional returns to northern climes
for the blessings which they alone can give.

Shall the missionary indulge in recreations? Among missionaries themselves this is a much debated
question. Some maintain that all forms of recreation are unworthy of a man engaged in this
holy calling. I do not agree with them. I have seen many missionaries helped in their work
by such recreation. There are some men and women who have no taste for such diversions. To
them they may have little value or usefulness. But, to the ordinary missionary who has done
a hard day’s work an hour’s diversion in tennis, badminton or golf has often been a godsend.
It has brought relief to the tense nerves and a new lease of life to the organs of the body.
In a similar way an interest in carpentry, in geology, photography, or any other set study,
brings to the jaded mind a diversion and a new lease of power, and prepares one to go back
to his work with fresh pleasure and renewed enthusiasm.

One should carefully avoid entering inordinately into any such recreation. There is danger,
and sometimes a serious danger, that such lines of diversion may be carried to an excess, and
the mind and heart be thereby robbed of, rather than strengthened for, one’s life-work.

2. His Methods of Life.

There are questions of importance which come under this consideration and which are much discussed
at the present time. It is asked, for instance, whether a man should go out as a married, or
as a single, missionary. A few years ago the American Board showed very decided preference
for the married missionary, and hesitated to send, except under special circumstances, bachelors.
Missionary societies connected with ritualistic churches, on the other hand, have given preference,
almost exclusive preference, to the unmarried missionary. At the present time there is a growing
feeling, in all Protestant denominations, that there is a demand, and a specially appropriate
field of usefulness, both for the married and the unmarried missionary. The supreme argument
in favour of the married man is connected with the home influence which he establishes and
which, in itself, is a great blessing to the heathen people among whom he lives. The light
and beauty of a Western Christian home is always a mighty testimony, not only to the Gospel,
but to the civilization of the West which is a direct product of the Gospel. Through the wife
is also conserved the health of the husband who is thereby rendered more efficient. And to
his activity is added her equally beneficent one among the women of their charge. The missionary
home constitutes a testimony and a power which no mission can be without.

On the other hand, there is a large and an attractive field of usefulness which can best be
worked by the unmarried man and woman. There are forms of activity and lines of self-denial
which can best be met by those who are not tied down by home life and who are more free to
meet the rapidly changing necessities of certain departments of work. It is also true that
the unmarried life represents to the Orient that type of self-denial which has always been
associated, in their mind, with the highest degree of religious attainment; and it may, for
this very reason, be in the line of highest influence upon the people of the land.

So, married and unmarried life have in the mission field today their recognized place, advantage,
and sphere of influence. And, working together they will exemplify to the people those forms
of religious life and activity which bring highest glory to our cause.

Another question pertains to the missionary’s daily life. Shall he conform to the ordinary
habits of life practiced by the people among whom he lives? In other words, shall the missionary
from the West conform to native customs in food and dress? It is not possible to give a categorical
reply to this question. A country should be studied and the ideals of the people thoroughly
investigated by the missionary before he decides upon any course of action in this matter.
There are countries where such conformity would be desirable and would add considerably to
the missionary’s influence and success. China is such a country; and many of the missionaries
in that land find it to their interest, and to the interest of the work, to adopt the Chinese
costume, cue and all. They thus cease to appear foreign and peculiar in a land where to be
a foreigner is to be hated, or at least to be unloved and distrusted by the people.

The same thing has been tried in India, not only in clothing, but also to a large extent in
food. Many a missionary, feeling how great a barrier his foreign habits created between him
and the people, and inspired by a passionate desire to come near to them in order that he might
bless them, has divested himself of European clothing, adopted the native costume (at least
so far as it was possible for him to do so) and has confined himself to native food. But I
have never known of any Western missionary who has continued this method for a long time and
declared it a success. One of the most pathetic instances on record is that of the famous Jesuit
missionary Abbe Du Bois, who, after a careful study of the situation, donned the yellow garb
of the Hindu monk and became practically a Hindu to the Hindus, spending most of his time in
travelling from town to town and living strictly, both as regards food, clothing, and general
habits, as an ordinary Hindu in order that he might gain close access to the people and thus
win many converts to the Roman Catholic Church. For many years, in a distinguished missionary
career, he followed this method of life. But was it a success? In his “Life and Letters,” written
at the close of his missionary life, he frankly confesses that that method of approach to the
people had proved an entire failure; that he had not thereby gained any added influence over
them or had become better able to lead them into the Christian fold. He maintains that, so
far as this style of living was concerned, he had accomplished absolutely nothing for India.
I have known of ardent and able Protestant missionaries also who have tried the same method,
with the same result, and have returned to their Western costume and food.

The Salvation Army, at the beginning of its work a few years ago in India, compelled all its
officers fully to adopt Indian methods of life. This was enforced, in its rigour, only for
a short time; but for a sufficiently long period to reveal its disastrous effects upon the
health and life of its European officers. Their system has been considerably modified, but
is still unsatisfactory on the score of health and usefulness.

It is now recognized by all that the differences between the natives of tropical India and
the inhabitants of northern climes, and between the tropical clime and that of the temperate
zone, are so great that we of the Northwest cannot, with wisdom and impunity, adopt the manners
of life of that people. There are differences so great, both in clothing and in food, that
it would require generations of acclimatization before the change could be wisely adopted in
its entirety. It is indeed desirable that the European or American, who goes to live in the
tropics, should change somewhat his diet so as to meet the changed requirements of his system
there. But, to adopt the native diet is a very different thing, and will be conducive neither
to nourishment nor digestion.

There is, however, another question of more importance than this and one which seriously confronted
the Abbe Du Bois. What is gained in accessibility to, and power over, the people by adopting
these native habits? It should be remembered that Westerners have lived in India so long as
to have become perfectly well known to all the people. Moreover, the Western garb and habits
of life represent to the Hindu honour, influence, power, and culture. In his heart of hearts
the Hindu highly respects, and is always ready to listen to, that man of the West who is true
to himself and stands before him for what he is and for what he teaches. The ordinary Hindu
is not stupid enough to be deceived as to a man’s nationality or true position in life because
of his change of clothing or food. Indeed, to nine-tenths of all Hindus, such a change of habits,
on the part of a European, would mean nothing else than that he had lost caste among his own
people and had descended to a much lower social scale than formerly. It is well to remember
in India that the way of access to the people is opened to the Westerner not through such outer
changes of life, but through true manifestations of kindness and love to them. They are quick
to understand the language of love and would never confound it with outer posings of men who
are thereby seeking to win their favour.

The Rev. Geo. Bowen, of Bombay, was perhaps one of the most self-denying of all the missionaries
who lived in that land. He reduced the annual expenses of his living to $150.00. It was in
this path of self-denial that he sought to find greatest usefulness as a missionary. Of this
life he said at one time: “I have not been wholly disappointed, but I have not been successful
enough to make me feel like advising any one else to follow my example. And yet I have not
so completely failed as to make me regret the course which I have pursued. I have discovered
that the gulf which separates the people of this country is not a social one at all; it is
simply the great impassable gulf which separates between the religion of Christ and an unbelieving
world.”

It may be laid down as a general principle of life in that land that the missionary should
adopt that method of life which, while consistent with severe economy, shall best conduce to
health and efficiency of service among the people.

And in this connection it should also be stated that there are many things which are perfectly
natural and wise and desirable in the line of self help in America which should be unnecessary
and unwise in such a land as India. It is a safe rule adopted by the best missionary workers
in that land that a European should never do those things which can easily be done by natives
in the matter of domestic service. It would be folly for a missionary man or woman to spend
much time in household work and in similar duties when there are many people around whose special
province that is, and who can do it for one-thirtieth his own wage, and who can thus release
him for the more serious and higher duties of life.

Thus, in all these matters, one should consider fully the whole situation—the character of
the climate, of the people, and the conditions of the best health and efficiency and greatest
usefulness of the missionary worker.

The question as to the length of the missionary’s service is an important one. Shall he enter
upon it for a definite term or shall he consider it his life work? In most missions and societies
the missionary service is considered a life service. It is a service so peculiar in its training
and in its direction; it tends in many ways so to lead a man away from the atmosphere of work
and direction of activity found at home, that it is better for him, who undertakes it at all,
to consecrate himself to it as the great mission of his life. It is also a fact that the longer
he continues in it, the more ability and aptness he acquires for that special work.

There are, of course, some who will find that they have mistaken their vocation and that missionary
work does not suit them; or, rather, that they are not adapted to it. Such people should make
no delay in returning home and in seeking a more congenial life work.

3. The Intellectual Ability and Educational Training of the Missionary.

Whatever may have been the case in the past, the day certainly has come when India demands
only men and women of wide intelligence and thorough training as missionaries. Whether we regard
it as a land of profound philosophy, and of a marvellously organized religion; or whether we
consider the intellectual power of many of the natives of that land, the missionary must be
amply prepared, through educational and intellectual equipment, to meet them. One of the saddest
sights seen in India is a missionary who has absolutely no interest in the religious philosophy
of the land, and who is not able to appreciate the mutual relations of that faith and his own
and who is unequal to the task of discussing intelligently with, and of convincing in, matters
of faith, the educated natives of the country. Such a man apparently did not know that he would
meet in that land many university graduates who are still believers in, and defenders of, their
ancestral faith. So he finds himself unable to stand before such men and to give reason for
the faith that is in him so as to satisfy their earnest, intelligent inquiries, or to quiet
their keen opposition.

It should also be remembered that, in addition to this growing host of natives of university
training and culture, there is a considerable number of Europeans in government service and
in other departments. They come into constant touch with the missionary, and gauge his culture
and capacity, and are sure to judge of the missionary work according to their estimate of his
training and qualification.

In such a land, and facing such conditions, and in the presence of such people, the missionary
should be a man of thorough training and culture, and should have a mind which has ample command
of the treasures of knowledge which it has acquired. He should also be able to find interest
in various branches of learning. As I said above, he should, in some respects, be a man of
special training with definite and high qualifications for the special department upon which
he has entered; but he should also be not narrow, but of broad sympathies and of a growing
interest in the general realm of culture. He should continue to cultivate his student tastes,
and should grow constantly in ability and aptitude to grapple with the mighty problems of the
land. He should be able not only to understand the many aspects of Hinduism and of Buddhism,
which has entered so largely into the Hindu faith, but he must also know considerable about
Mohammedanism, since it is held by one-fifth of the population of that land.

It is well that he be thoroughly grounded in Christian doctrine before he enters upon his missionary
duties. I have known men to enter the mission field who had not clear views and definite convictions
concerning some of the most essential Christian doctrines; with the consequence that they drifted
away from their moorings and had to recast their faith, under adverse circumstances, on the field.

The mission field is no place for a man to readjust his faith and to discover that his religious
affiliations are not what they ought to be.

It is not a question whether a man’s theology is of the conservative, or of the progressive,
type. Both types may be needed. It is largely a question whether he has grasped clearly and
with conviction any doctrine—whether he has thought for himself and appropriated any system
of truth. Or, I should say, whether any sort of theology has gripped him in its power. Bishop
Thoburn has well said that “the young missionary should have a clear and well-grounded theology
before going abroad. His views of vital theological truth should be clear and settled. The
Christian Church of America cannot afford to export doubts or even religious speculation to
foreign fields. The people of India, and I may add of other lands, are abundantly able to provide
all the doubts and all the unprofitable speculation that any church will care to contend with;
and one important qualification of the missionary should be a positive faith as opposed to
doubt, and a clear system of living truth as opposed to profitless speculation.” Above all,
the missionary should have a working faith in the gospel—not a half-grounded conviction. There
may be a place at home for the unsettled mind; the mission field is not for such. In India,
especially, while there is ample room and abundant opportunity and inducement for progress
in thought and development in doctrinal construction, there is no place for destructive doubts
and mental unsettlement. Positive teaching and not interrogations and destructive doubts should
characterize the missionary. Give us a man who knows something and is inspired with convictions.
For, it should be remembered, the missionary is preëminently an instructor. He must give himself
to the work of establishing others in living, satisfying, saving truth. He is to instruct the
people, as a preacher, in the way of salvation. He is also called upon to furnish a working
equipment of truth to pastors, preachers and teachers. He should be conversant with the Bible
and with the various theories of interpretation. He should be possessed of a clear system of
theology and should understand the best methods and principles of Christian work.

For the attaining of all this, the missionary must continue as an earnest student, he must
maintain upon the field thorough habits of study. His missionary life, itself, should be to
him, not only an interpreter of what he formerly studied, but an incitement to further regular
study. Many temptations overtake the missionary to intellectual indolence as well as to intellectual
dissipation. He is in danger, under the pressure of other interesting work and distractions,
either not to read anything very seriously or to read in a haphazard, desultory way. The latter
is specially a dangerous habit on the mission field. The missionary needs not only to cultivate
habits of study and to devote certain hours daily, so far as possible, to that habit; he should,
preëminently, keep before him some definite aim or ideal towards which all his reading should
be directed. If he be specially a preacher, he should conscientiously and thoroughly prepare
his sermons as if he were to preach to the most cultured audiences; or, if he instruct his
agents, he should make previous, elaborate preparation for the same.

He should take an intelligent interest in, and make a thorough study of, the people, their
social and religious customs, their economic conditions, their educational efforts, their history,—these
and many other studies will furnish abundant and abounding interest to the thoughtful missionary
and will add to his power in his work. In all these respects, no people on earth are more interesting
than those of India. And for successful spiritual work among them the missionary needs to study
these side issues more than he would, perhaps, among any other people.

He will find it of much help if he is apt at acquiring language. A good and usable knowledge
of the vernacular of the people is a most important avenue of access to their mind and heart.
The acquiring of a living language is a very different thing from the study of a dead language.
A man may be a success in the one and a failure in the other. A good ear is of paramount importance
in a first-class facility for acquiring and using a modern vernacular.

I would not say that a man who has not a good command of the vernacular of a people cannot
be to them a good missionary; for a few of the best missionaries I know, speak the vernacular
wretchedly. But I do emphasize the fact that proficiency here is of prime importance and I
would also add that it should be the first work of a missionary after entering his field. To
dawdle with the language the first year, is, generally speaking, to fail in acquiring it at all.

Should a young man, who intends to become a missionary, receive a special preparatory training
for missionary work? Yes, to a certain extent. I heartily approve of all recent courses established
in theological institutions with a view to training their students in missionary principles
and literature. And I would that these courses were much enlarged so as to correspond with
the relative importance of the missionary work. Beyond all this, I believe that every student,
who intends to become a missionary, should spend time during his last year or two as a student
in special preparation for his work and field. For instance, it were a great help to him who
is to become a missionary in India that he study seriously the Sanskrit language and Hindu
philosophy. These two would give him an important start upon his missionary career and, probably,
furnish him with initial taste for that larger equipment which is essential to the great missionary.
It is of course understood that the modern science of Comparative Religion has already had
his attention in the general course of study. Too much emphasis cannot be placed upon the study
of this science as an aid to the modern missionary.

I would also urge here the importance of each missionary, so far as his tastes and ability
permit, preparing himself for the work of enriching the Christian literature of the field and
country of his choice. In India this is becoming a matter, not only of growing, but also of
paramount, importance. In the past, missionaries have been too much engrossed with the other
departments of work to give themselves to the production of tracts and books. Much more must
be done in this line in the future. Every year adds to the need for, and the influence of,
a worthy literary effort expressed in the various vernaculars of India. The growing host of
readers in the Christian communities and among the non-Christians is a loud cry for missionary
consecration to this specific work.

There is not one possession or element of power connected with a thorough education and high
culture which will not become available and most useful in that interesting land, and which
will not be transmuted into power for the elevation and redemption of that people.

4. Spiritual Qualifications.

It would hardly seem necessary to speak on this subject. It must be everywhere understood that
a life of spiritual power is, and must ever remain, the first requisite of the missionary.
And yet, I fear that the missionary force of today reveals more serious delinquency at this
point than at any other. If missionaries were asked, wherein lies the chief hindrance to their
work, I believe they would, all but unanimously, refer to their want of spiritual power. Not
that they are more defective in this respect than are the ministers at home. They are a noble
band of consecrated men and women. But they greatly need, and bemoan their need of, a growing
spiritual endowment, the possession of which would give to them a new joy, and, to the people,
an inexhaustible gift of life, and to the missionary work a power hitherto unknown.

A man should not go out as a foreign missionary unless he has a definite call from God to go.
It must be laid so strongly upon his heart that he feels the necessity of going forth unto
the heathen. There must be a constraining power and a felt conviction within, that in the mission
field alone can he find rest and peace and power.

The missionary should be a man of pronounced and positive spirituality—a man who loves the
Word of God, who finds meditation in it sweet, and who finds relief, strength and joy in frequent
daily prayer. The depressing influences which beset his spiritual life are many. The all-pervasive,
chilling influence of heathenism, and its dead and deadening ceremonialism tend to exercise
an increasing power over him. He will not, at first, realize this influence; but as an insidious
and an ever swelling tide of evil it will come into his soul, unless he is well guarded and
daily fortified against it by frequent communion with God. In India the hardening influence
of the all-surrounding heathenism is as subtle as it is potent in its influence upon the life
of any Christian worker and needs to be overcome by constant spiritual culture.

The life of the European Christians who reside in that country is so far from being Christlike
and is so wanting in these spiritual traits which should characterize an earnest Christian,
that the missionary constantly has to guard himself against its influence upon himself.

The loneliness of the missionary—his frequent and long-continued absence from those means of
grace which so largely minister to the spiritual strength of a pastor in this country—is something
deeply felt. Few men realize the extent of the spiritual helps which the Christian society
of America renders to the aspiring life of a man of God. In his loneliness, in the far-off
land, the missionary feels its absence keenly.

Moreover, all the native Christians of the community of which he is the official head look
up to him for inspiration. Is he wanting in faith, hopefulness and cheer; is he depressed and
discouraged; is he lacking in the power of prayer and of sweet communion with God? It is marvellous
how quickly this frame of mind is transmitted from him to the people of his charge. The pastors,
catechists and other mission agents of his field all look to him for their ideal and seek to
draw from him their inspiration in spiritual life. Is he down; then they are down with him.
In coldness as in spiritual ardour they faithfully reflect his life and temper. It is, indeed,
true that many of these live spiritual lives which bring inspiration and spiritual joy to him.
The simplicity and earnestness of the faith of most of the native Christians is beautiful.
Still, in many respects, he finds the community a heavy spiritual drain upon him; and, if he
is to maintain himself as a worthy leader in the higher Christian life, he must live constantly
with God and find daily strength in Him.

In India, specially, there are needed a few definite spiritual gifts which I desire to emphasize
and which a missionary should aim to cultivate.

The first in order, if not in importance, is patience. To us of the West the Orient seems preëminently
slow. To them of the East we of the West rush everything unduly and are the victims of impatience.
But they fail to understand it; and the missionary’s power with them is very largely impaired
by the manifestation of this evil spirit. Even if impatience were ever, anywhere, a virtue,
in India it is always an unmixed evil and should be guarded against. The warning is the more
needed because the tropical climate itself is a very bad irritant to the nervous system. Among
the Hindus patience is regarded the supreme virtue of God and of man; and it should adorn every
missionary who seeks to be their leader.

Humility also is a grace which needs much cultivation by the missionary. He has constant temptation
to pride. The sin of masterfulness is naturally his besetting sin; for his influence over his
people and his control in the direction of his work gradually grow sweet to him and develop,
if he is not very careful, into an imperiousness of will which is neither pleasant to those
who come in contact with him, nor consistent with the golden grace of humility, nor in any
sense pleasing to God.

Love—that essence of divine character—needs preëminent guarding, encouragement and development
on the part of the missionary. There is so much that is unlovely and unlovable all about him,
so little to attract and draw out his tender emotions that he needs to drink freely from the
fountain of love above; or he will degenerate very easily into a hard, cold, unsympathetic,
cynical missionary—a frame of mind which will utterly disqualify him for any joy or power in
his work. One of the best missionaries I have known used to pray very frequently—“O Lord, save
me from the sin of despising this people.” It is a prayer which every missionary may find it
necessary to offer frequently. True Christian love is none the less necessary, yea the more
necessary on the mission field, because the missionary lives among people who are not kindred
in blood to himself.

Then he needs also a large gift of faith and of hope. The smallness of the Christian Church
in the midst of a dense mass of heathenism; the apparent inadequacy of earthly means to convert
that great people to Christ; the slowness of progress and the fewness of results—all these
tend to depress and discourage the worker. And he needs to offer for himself, as for his people,
the prayer which Elisha offered in behalf of the young man,—“O Lord, I pray thee open his eyes
that he may see. I believe that the people in the East are much more amenable to this influence
and much more ready to follow spiritual guidance than are the people of our own land. And this,
in itself, is an added reason for deep spirituality in the missionary.

5. The Missionary’s Attitude Towards the Non-Christian World.

This attitude is one of considerable importance to the missionary because it furnishes largely
the motive of his life work. Before one goes out as a missionary he should acquire some definite
and sound views as to the condition of the non-Christians who constitute three-fourths of our
race. This means that he must decide as to his missionary motive,—what motive power shall impel
him to leave his native land and go to live among a benighted people surrounded by a thousand
disadvantages.

Since the organization of our missionary societies—less than a century ago—there has been an
important change of emphasis in the matter of missionary motives. The progress, I might almost
say revolution, in theology has worked towards this change. The recent discovery of new sciences,
and the utilization of the wonderful modern means of communication whereby a new knowledge
of non-Christian peoples has been made possible to us, has affected our consideration of the
whole problem of missionary work and has especially modified the missionary motive. Dr. W.
N. Clark, in his admirable book on Christian Missions, discusses fully this question. “The
difference,” he says, “between our conception of man today and that of a century ago is mainly
not that something true has fallen out of it, though that may be the fact with many minds:
it is rather that immeasurably much that is true has been added to it. Unquestionably our conception
of man is still incomplete, unbalanced and incorrect, but it certainly has been altered within
the century by the addition of much that must remain in any true conception. Our knowledge
must have experienced true and legitimate growth and from our present conception of the human
world we can never go back to that which our fathers held when they began the work of modern
missions ... our thought concerning our fellow-men contains elements of truth and justice that
our fathers knew nothing of. The best Christian feeling towards the heathen world today is
far more true, righteous, sympathetic, Christlike, than the feelings of those who were interested
in missions an hundred years ago. But the single motive which, standing alone, led to the missionary
enterprise has come to be so surrounded by other thoughts and motives as to lose its relative
importance, and be less available than it then was as a controlling influence. This is one
of the great and significant causes of the crisis in missions.”

It is not necessarily true that the paramount motive of a century ago is no longer believed;
but that other motives have grown and reached a commanding influence as a power in the Christian
consciousness of today. A Christian missionary has indeed changed his views, for instance,
concerning the origin and character of Hinduism. Through modern enlightenment and the study
of comparative religion no man can go out as a missionary, even as I was expected to go less
than a quarter of a century ago, with a general belief that that great religion is entirely
of the devil and is in itself evil and only evil continually. The missionary of today must
discriminate, must study appreciation and consider historic facts. He must know that ethnic,
and all non-Christian religions, have had their uses, and that some still have their uses in
the world. They are the expression of the deepest religious instincts of the human soul. And
they have, especially such a faith as Hinduism, not a few elements of truth which a missionary
should know no less than he should understand the great evils which enter as a part of them.

The greatest missionary motive of today lies in the last commission of our Lord which emanates
from the heart, and reveals the essence of our religion. His command to his disciples to go
and disciple the nations stands now as the Supreme Christian Command; and its significance
is appreciated and emphasized today as never before. And so long as a Church gives increasing
emphasis to this, His greatest commission, it must necessarily be in the path of duty, of privilege,
of blessing and of power. Above all other missionary motives this must remain supreme.

And there must go hand in hand with this loyalty to Christ, a deepening loyalty to Christianity
and a growing appreciation of its uniqueness in the world. Christianity is not one religion
among many; it stands alone as the soul-satisfying and soul-saving faith. The scattered lights
of other faiths find here their centre, and all their prophesies find here fulfillment. The
need of Christianity, by all men, is supreme. Whatever may be said in favour of other faiths
we must say of them that they are, in many respects, perverted and are inadequate as a means
of salvation.

And in addition to this the missionary must feel that all non-Christian peoples are in supreme
need of Christ, the Saviour. This fact we cannot afford to qualify, without, in very truth,
cutting the nerve of missions. When a missionary regards Christ and His mission and message
as only an incident in the life and need of our race and ceases to acknowledge that all men
need Christ supremely, he had better give up his work; for his missionary motive has lost its
foundation and his life work has been robbed of its power.

The missionary is called to go wherever the Macedonian cry of human need and of spiritual helplessness
is heard. Our Lord’s command was world-embracing in its extent; it was a discipling of all
nations; it was a call to be witnesses unto the uttermost parts of the earth.

Shall the missionary go and preach everywhere the gospel of Christ, whether men invite him
or not? In view of recent events in China and in other lands some people (and among them are
a few well-meaning Christians) question our duty and even our right and privilege to carry
the gospel to a people against its will and when it is satisfied with its own faith. They claim
that this restraint is demanded by true Christian altruism and by the spirit of Christ. That
the day has come when the Christian Church should thoroughly reconsider the best methods of
missionary approach to such peoples I readily agree. I also maintain that Protestant missions
should everywhere scrupulously avoid all Jesuitical methods and political influences and should
always strive to minimize, if not ignore, their political rights and magnify the spiritual
side of their work. Under these conditions no people has lent an unwilling ear to the missionary’s
message, or, for a long time, failed to rejoice in his presence and work. But had missionary
societies sent their missionaries only to those people who invited them, or were prepared to
give them a cordial welcome, where could they have found work or how achieve the magnificent
success of the last century? Imagine the great missionary apostle sending messengers in advance
to inquire whether the inhabitants of Lystra and Ephesus, of Thessalonica and Athens were willing
to receive him, and turning away his face because, forsooth, they were not prepared to welcome
him! The only invitation he did receive was from Macedonia in a vision. The acceptance of the
invitation brought to him at once opposition and stripes. Paul said that he knew that bonds
awaited him wherever he went. But that did not deter him.

Had our Lord Himself considered the attitude of man towards Himself He would never have come
down to men. He came to fling fire upon the earth—to bring not peace but a sword. He was despised
and rejected of men. Like Him, missionaries must consider the deep spiritual need and not the
desire of a people. Above all, they must be assured everywhere, in their great life work, that
they are sent by God rather than invited by men.

The relationship into which a man, who becomes a missionary, enters with the missionary society
and the churches is a very precious one, and should be fully realized. In a peculiar sense
he has become their adopted child—the subject of their prayer and the object of their pride.
They have taken him into their own heart and his support and success are their peculiar concern.

He is the connecting link between them and the work which they support and cherish in the far-off
land. Whatever of interest, of joy and of responsibility they possess in that work passes through
him. He is to them the channel through which flow their endeavours. He is the living embodiment
of their interest in the work as also of their effort to bring the heathen to Christ. And in
like manner he has become to them the articulate cry of the heathen world for help. He represents
to them at the same time both the progress of the work, its need and the claims of a heathen
world upon them. He is their agent to develop and inspire their infant Mission Church. He is
also the almoner of their benevolence.

In all these capacities it is well that he remember, constantly, how much he depends for inspiration
as for support upon those who have sent him forth to the heathen and who, under God, sustain
him and his work. He should cultivate full appreciation of their endeavour; he should keep
himself in living, loving touch with both society and churches; and he should deem it his duty
and privilege to furnish them with all light and intelligence concerning his work. It is thus
that he must strengthen their faith and inspire their hearts in the great and far-off work
which they are maintaining. It is his opportunity to add fuel to the ardor and enthusiasm of
all the churches in the missionary endeavour. In this he has an important function to perform
and should endeavour to magnify his office.

In my opinion the relationship between the missionary and those whom he represents at home
might easily be strengthened and improved by added recognition and courtesy to him in the home-land.
At present the foreign missionary of the congregational churches is simply regarded as their
paid agent. This relationship is indeed a pleasant and a cordial one. The American Board is
most appreciative of the labors of its missionary agents and deals with them generously. The
churches also give them a cordial welcome and a warm hearing. But the missionary has no status
whatever beyond this. He returns for a furlough to the home-land and feels himself, in a peculiar
sense, a stranger. He has no official connection whatever with his society; his voice is not
heard in its councils; his wisdom and experience are not sought in its deliberations. In other
words, though possessed of a large stock of knowledge which might be of value to the Board
in the shaping of its policy and in the direction of its work at its annual meetings, he has
absolutely no voice or place there and stands apart from its organization, beyond the privilege
of being its foreign servant. The missionary body has felt this deprivation and isolation during
critical periods in the history of the Board; and it still feels that, at least some of its
number should be permitted both to enjoy the honour, and also to render the service incident
to being corporate members of the Board.

The situation is no better in his relation to the home churches. He is a member, probably,
of some church in the home-land; but, upon his return home he has no status whatever in any
Conference or Association, or as a member of a Ministerial body among his home brethren. In
his deputation work at home he finds welcome, as a stranger or as an outsider, and not as a
member or as an integral part of any body or Association.

The position of the missionary is different among the Methodists. Every minister of that body
finds that, by becoming a foreign missionary he does not separate himself from home ties and
privileges. His ministerial connection is preserved intact, so that he has a status in the
churches and in the missionary society.

7. The Missionary and the Mission To Which He Belongs.

When a man becomes a member of a foreign mission he soon realizes that he has become a part
of a compact organization. All its members are bound together by the warmest ties of friendship
and love. Largely separated from the world and knit together by common purpose as by all their
highest ambitions, they verily become a big family whose love increases as the years multiply,
and among whom the spirit of dissension can only create the deepest sorrow and greatest bitterness.
It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that every one who becomes a missionary should be
a man of peace; should know how to live in harmony with all his brethren. He should cultivate
that spirit and should aim to see eye to eye with those who are thus so intimately connected
with him. In loving sympathy they should unite in the serious concerns of their life-work.
One of the first requisites demanded from a missionary applicant from the American Board is
that he be of a peaceable disposition—able to live harmoniously with others. And it is not
only a suggestion that should be heeded by every missionary; it is also a rule which should
be enforced by every missionary society.

Each mission has behind it a history, and, before it, more or less of an aim and policy. It
should be the ambition of every member of that mission to study and honour the one, and to
be faithful and loyal to the other. The history of most missions in India is precious and full
of instruction. They have sainted heroes and most interesting traditions. The missionary should
not only study the records of his own mission and draw from them every possible lesson for
his life; he should also enter heartily into the spirit of the mission and endeavour cordially
to bring himself en rapport with its highest wisdom, deepest purposes and most cherished schemes
for the future. It is not necessary that he be satisfied with all that the mission has done;
he should also aim, in the spirit of humility and of patience, to constitutionally influence
his brethren to his own new views and better way of thinking, if he have any. Above all, he
should aim to conserve rather than to destroy. The blessings of the past should be utilized
in attaining higher things for the future. Revolutionary methods are ill-adapted to add blessing
to such a work. It should also be the aim of the missionary to so further the work of his mission
that it may soon cease to be a necessity. A mission, at best, is but a temporary thing. It
should constantly aim to so nourish and strengthen the native church as to make itself unnecessary.
And it should be the aim of the missionary to hasten, with all speed, this consummation.

8. The Relation of the Missionary to the People Among Whom He Lives.

Having entered upon his work and settled among the people of his choice, he must seek to realize
the best possible relation to them. This relationship will be a varied one.

He must be a leader of the Christian community. In India, today, there is special need for
missionaries who are born leaders. The people of that land are defective in the power of initiative;
but they are most tractable and docile. They love to follow a bold and a wise leader of men.
And the missionary, from the very necessity of his position, should be able to direct and guide
the Christian community into ways of holiness and of Christian activity. He is to be a leader
of leaders. He should marshal the mission agents connected with him in such a way as to lead
the native Church into highest usefulness and most earnest endeavour for the salvation of souls.

He should be strong as an organizer and administrator. In missions the word organization is
becoming the keyword of the situation. There is no danger of over-organization, so long as
the organization is endowed with life and does not degenerate into machinery. The best organized
activities of today are the most powerful and the most useful. And the missionary will find
his highest powers for organization taxed to the utmost in his missionary work. And as an administrator
there will be made many claims upon him daily. I know of few qualifications that are more essential
to the highest success on the mission field than conspicuous ability to organize and wisdom
to administer the affairs of a mission. Missionaries frequently fail at this point and need
therefore to strengthen themselves in this particular.

A missionary should be as much the conserver of the good as a destroyer of the evil which he
finds among the people. Much of that which he will see in India, for instance, will at first,
and perhaps for a long time, seem strange and outlandish to him; but let him not decide that
it is therefore evil. The life of the Orient is built on different lines from that of the Occident.
Many things in common life, in domestic economy and in social customs will, and must, be different
there from what they are here. Their civilization, though different from ours, has a consistency
as a whole; and we cannot easily eliminate certain parts and substitute for them those of our
own civilization without dislocating the whole. Therefore, it is often safer and better to
conserve what seems to us the lesser good of their civilization than to introduce what seems
the greater good of our own.

The missionary must be careful to distinguish between those things which are real, and those
which are apparent, evils among the customs of the people. There are some customs, such as
are connected with the degradation of woman and heathen ceremonies which are fundamentally
wrong and must be opposed always. There are others which seem uncouth and unworthy, but which
are devoid of moral or religious significance. Of two missionaries, the one who studies to
utilize the existing good among the habits of the people will find greatest usefulness. Some
waste their time, destroy their influence and minimize their usefulness by a destructive way
of attacking everything that is not positively good and beating their head against every wall
of custom.

The missionary should be a prophet to rebuke and to condemn evil. He will find numberless evils
on all sides of him—in Church, in general society and in individual life among the people.
He must not hesitate to use constantly his voice as a protest against all forms of evil. This
duty is the more incumbent upon him as there are none among the people to protest and to denounce
the most flagrant, demoralizing and universal evils of the land. One of the most discouraging
things concerning the situation in India is, not the universality of certain evils, but the
utter absence of those who dare to withstand them and denounce them as sins before all the
people. Missionaries have done more in that land to rightly characterize certain gross evils
and to call the attention of the people to them than have any other people in the land. And
they have recognition for this. And this prophetic function of the missionary must be exercised
with increasing faithfulness for the good of the land and for the purity of the Church of God.

In that country the missionary must also stand before the people as their exemplar. He must
represent, not only Christianity at its best, but also the civilization of the West in its
purest and most attractive garb. India has always greatly needed such human types of nobility
of character to encourage and stimulate the people to a higher life. With all modesty and due
humility the missionary is called upon just as much to live as he is to teach the best that
is found in his religion and in the civilization of his mother country. In India, the life
of the missionary has spoken more loudly than his words. There are millions in that land today,
who, while they deny and reject the teaching of the missionary, give him unstinted praise both
for what he is and for what he has done for the country.

The testimony of Sir William Mackworth Young, Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab is only one of
many such;—“I take off my hat to the humblest missionary that walks a bazaar in India,” he
said, in a recent public address, “because he is leading a higher and a grander life and doing
a grander work than any other class of persons who are working in India. If the natives of
India have any practical knowledge of what is meant by Christian charity, if they know anything
of high, disinterested motives and self-sacrifice, it is mainly from the missionary that they
learn it. The strength of our position in India depends more largely upon the good-will of
the people than upon the strength and number of our garrisons, and for that good-will we are
largely indebted to the kindly, self-sacrificing efforts of the Christian missionary. It is
love which must pave the way for the regeneration of India as well as for the consolidation
of England’s power.”

The missionary must never lose this crown of glory in India. He must hold it most precious
and strive to add to the glory which he thus reflects upon his Faith in that land.

MISSIONARY ORGANIZATION.

Thorough organization of any work is essential to its highest efficiency. The Missionary Department
of the work of the Christian Church should, therefore, be well organized. As missionary effort
expands, grows in intensity and increases in power, it must find a growingly efficient organization
in order to adequately express itself and to attain further growth.

1. A thorough Missionary Organization at home is the first requisite in order to highest success.
Thus only can the missionary work abroad be maintained and fostered; because, by this means
only can missionary ardour be kindled in the churches. A Church which is not adequately marshalled
for activity in heathen lands will soon become self-centred and will easily forget the claims,
if not the very existence, of the heathen.

A Foreign Missionary Society of well organized efficiency has, up to the present, been the
best agency in the development and furtherance of the foreign work of every denomination. And
the day does not seem near when this agency can be dispensed with.

This missionary society should be in close touch with the denomination or body of Christians
which has organized and maintains it. It should be plastic to the touch and will of its constituency
and should seek in every way to be at the same time a faithful exponent of the thought and
ambition of the churches, and a leader and a source of new inspiration and light to them on
missionary problems. This society should scrupulously avoid, on the one hand, the danger of
too much independence and of a purpose to shape the missionary policy of the churches; and,
on the other, the equally serious evil of dragging, or of declining to move a step without
the direct intimation, command or leadership of the churches. There has been a time in the
history of the American Board when the one evil constituted its danger; at the present time
it would seem as if the other danger seriously threatened it.

It is of much importance that the foreign missionary benevolences of a church should be wisely
administered as a whole. When different missionary societies of a denomination appeal, as they
do at present, to our churches for funds to support the missionary cause in foreign lands,
it is of great importance that moneys received by these different bodies should be appropriated
wisely. They should be brought together both for unity of results and for economy of expenditure
on the mission field. My observation convinces me that, for want of a wise union or correlation
of our missionary agencies at home the various departments of the work (of the Congregationalists,
for instance) on the mission field are very unequally supported, and an unwise distribution
of the benevolences of the churches follows as a result. A previous, full consideration, by
a competent general committee of finance, in America, should be had of the needs of the various
departments of each mission and of the distribution of all the funds collected for that mission
by the various societies; and they should be carefully distributed in accordance with the urgency
of those needs respectively.

These missionary societies should aim to cultivate in the churches the spirit of missions as
a Christian principle. Advocates of the missionary cause strongly feel that the interest of
the Church in missionary work today is too little based upon the real and fundamental principle
of missionary work as a necessity of the life of the Church itself, and too much dependent
upon exciting narrative, tearful appeal and poetic romance. The cultivation of the missionary
principle and the inculcation of the doctrine of the privilege and beauty of supporting missions,
apart from any impassioned appeals or tragic events, is one of the desiderata of the Church
today. It is a morbid condition of the mind of the Church which demands exciting narrative
and hysterical appeal in order to arouse it to its duty in this matter; and it also tends to
create a standard of missionary advocacy which is neither manly nor sufficiently careful to
balance well the facts and data of missionary work as it is found upon the field. There is
considerable danger of accepting, today, only that form of missionary appeal which is directed
to the emotion and which abounds in mental excitement rather than that which furnishes food
for sober thought. The consequence is that this advocacy is in danger of becoming a producer
of more heat than light—of more emotion than intelligent conviction.

The recent movement towards leading certain churches to take up definite portions of the work
in foreign lands and to support, each a missionary for itself, has in it much to commend it
to our acceptance. It certainly has the merit of definiteness in purpose, work and prayer;
and this brings added interest and a growing sense of responsibility to each church which takes
up the work. If a man (or a church) finds his interest in missions waning as a principle of
Christian activity the best thing for him, perhaps, is to come into touch with a missionary
or a mission agent on the field. By supporting him or a department of work conducted by him,
and by being kept frequently informed of the work which he is supporting, new fuel is constantly
added to that missionary interest which thereby develops into zeal and enthusiasm. The method
has apostolic sanction and partakes of the simplicity of primitive missionary endeavour.

But this method should not be too exclusively pursued. It should not interfere with a broader
outlook upon missions and a general sympathy with, and support of, the common work. And all
of the work should be done through the missionary society which alone can rightly coördinate
and unify the whole work of the particular mission.

Faith Missions, so called, represent a genuine and a worthy spirit among many of God’s people
today. To them the somewhat lumbering business methods of the large missionary organizations
savour too much of worldly prudence and seem subversive of the deepest Christian faith. They
maintain that the old method is one that looks too much to men and too little to God for support.
And they also claim that the missionary of such a society has little opportunity for the exercise
of highest faith in God both for himself and his work. These new missions, therefore, have
come into existence practically, if not really, as a protest against modern methods of conducting
missionary work. They may do much good if they exercise some restraint upon missionary societies
in this matter. Probably it is needed. Many believe that there is an excessive tendency among
the directors of missionary societies, at the present day, to consider this great enterprise
simply as a business enterprise, and that, in the committee rooms, faith has yielded too much
to prudence, and the wings of missionary enterprise have been too much clipped by worldly considerations.
How far their reasoning is true, I will not decide. Their claim is not without a basis of truth.
The financial embarrassment brings to the Missionary Society today, much more than it used
to, discouragement and a halt; with the result that the missions are more than ever before
crippled by retrenchment and home churches are resting satisfied with smaller attainments and
are forgetting the old watchwords of progress and advance.

“Faith Missions” are created by and meet the needs of a certain class of people in the church
whose spiritual life is intense and who crave romance in faith and in life. The missionaries
of these societies tire of the great organizations of the church and are usually men who are
restless under any stiff method or extensive system in Christian work.

But very few such missionaries meet with permanent success. The glamour of the “faith life,”
so called, does not abide with them. Few men have the staying, as well as the supporting, faith
of a George Müller; and yet every missionary in this class should be a hero of faith—a man
with that special gift and power from God which will maintain itself and go on working under
the most adverse circumstances. And this is what the ordinary “faith missionary” does not possess
in an exceptional degree.

As a matter of fact, “Faith Missions” are decidedly wasteful of means in the conduct of their
work. If, in some ways, they practice more economy, in other matters of greatest importance,
there is deplorable wastefulness. For, they are wanting both in continuity and in wise management
and sane direction. As history has shown, they also easily degenerate into very prudential
methods and sensational forms of advertisement which destroy the very faith which the missions
were supposed to express and conserve. There is no less faith—rather is there more—exercised
by members of well-organized missions who depend upon God’s supply through the regular channel
of a society. For they can give themselves entirely to their work of faith and love, confident
that God will provide for their wants and the wants of their work; while the “faith missionary”
has to devote much time in anxious thought and in skillful and dubious methods of appeal to
secure the means of support.

One only needs to look at India today and there study the results of these two classes of missions
in order to see which method is the more economical and the more owned of God.

The Missionary Boards should keep in close touch and living communication with the missions
which they support. The mission to which I have the honour of belonging has not had the privilege,
until the last year, of receiving an official visitation from any member of our Board for nearly
forty-five years. That a society should aim, by its officials in one city, to conduct, for
so many years, a mission among its antipodes without having one representative among its directors
who has gazed upon that land, seen that people or studied on the ground any of its problems,
seems remarkable, and wants in that sagacity which usually directs us as a people. By frequent
visitations alone can such a society expect to be able to direct wisely and lead successfully
its missions. For, it is highly desirable, both in the interests of the mission itself, of
the society and of the home churches that at least some of the directors of the society should
know personally and well each mission supported through them. At no greater intervals than
five years such a visitation should be planned for every mission. I am confident that they
would add largely to the efficiency of our missionary work and increase the interest of home
churches in their foreign work. But such visiting committees should be willing to learn and
should not come out with preconceived ideas of what ought to be done, nor with bottled and
labelled remedies for all the ills of the mission. Some missions are sore today because of
a visitation many years ago, since it was not conceived in the spirit of highest wisdom and
teachableness.

2. The missions themselves also should be well organized for work. The success of a mission
will depend, in no small degree, upon the character of its organization. In India, today, there
is a great variety of missionary organizations. They range from the almost purely autocratic
ones, established by Christians of the European Continent, to the thoroughly democratic and
largely autonomous ones of the American Missions. German and Danish Missions are mostly controlled
by the home committees of their missionary societies. American Missions have a large degree
of autonomy in the conduct of their affairs. British Missions divide equally with their home
Society the right and privilege of conducting their affairs. It is certainly not wise that
a committee of gentlemen thousands of miles distant from the mission field should autocratically
direct and control, even to matters of detail, the affairs of their mission. The missionaries
on the ground should not only have the right to express their opinions, but should also have
a voice in conducting the affairs of the mission for whose furtherance they have given their
life, whose interests they dearly love and whose affairs they are the most competent to understand.

Nor yet should a mission be entirely free from foreign guidance and suggestion. Too much power
given to a mission is as really a danger as too little power. It is well for a mission that
it should have the aid of men who have large missionary interests under their guidance and
who are in full sympathy with home churches. The ideal mission is that which, on the one hand,
enjoys a large degree of autonomy in the conduct of its affairs, and yet which, on the other
hand, is wisely supported and strengthened by the restraining influence, suggestion and even
the occasional initiative of a well-formed home committee.

The relation of the mission to its own members should always be firm and its authority kindly
and wisely exercised. There may arise a serious danger of too much individualism in a mission.
A mission which does not have a policy of its own and conduct its whole work in harmony with
that policy, and so control the work of each of its members as to make it fully contribute
to the realization of its aims, will not attain unto the largest success in its efforts. When
each missionary is given absolute independence to develop his own work on his own lines it
will soon be found that whatever mission policy there may have been will be crushed out by
rampant individualism. And when each man is at liberty to follow his own inclination and to
direct his work according to his own sweet will, mission work will have lost its homogeneity.
Each section and department of the mission will be changed in direction and method of work
upon the arrival of every new missionary; and thus every blessing of continuity in work and
of a wholesome mission policy will be lost. I know of missions (American, of course) which
suffer seriously on this account. I also know of other missions which are seriously affected
by the opposite difficulty. The mission controls its work so completely, even to its last detail,
that it leaves to the individual missionary no freedom of action and no power of initiative.
The mission, in solemn conclave, decides even the character and quantity of food which must
be given each child in a boarding school conducted by one of its missionaries! A control which
reaches into such petty details as this, is not only a waste of time to the mission itself;
it seriously compromises the dignity, and destroys the sense of responsibility, of the individual
missionary. It takes away from him the power of initiative and thus largely diminishes his
efficiency.

The ideal mission is that which gives to each of its members some latitude for judgment and
direction, but which has a definite policy of its own and sees to it that this policy is, in
the main, respected and supported by every one of its missionaries.

It is an interesting fact, in the study of the missions of India, that the American Missions,
on the whole, represent the largest degree, both of mission autonomy and of missionary individualism.
The farther we pass east from America the more do we see mission autonomy yield to the control
of the home society; and the independence of the missionary lost in the absoluteness of mission
supervision.

How far shall missions give the power of franchise to their lady members in the conduct of
mission affairs? The last few years has seen this question agitated by many missions. They
differ largely in this matter. The Madura Mission has settled the problem by giving to the
women absolute equality with the men. This, probably, is an ideal solution. But it should be
accompanied by a similar movement in the missionary societies at Boston. The position at present
is anomalous in that mission; for while it has given to both sexes equal rights of franchise
and is therefore a unit in administrative power, the societies at home which support the general,
and the woman’s parts of the mission activity are entirely separate from and independent of
each other. It is not too much to hope that, at an early date, the relations of the home societies
may be changed towards unity of action, to correspond with the present situation in the mission
field.

The relation of missions contiguous to each other in foreign lands is a subject which is increasingly
engaging the thought of all missionaries. In the past, missions of different denominations
lived largely isolated from, and absolutely indifferent to, each other’s welfare. There was
much friction and jealousy, coupled with a readiness to disregard each other’s feelings and
a willingness to take advantage of each other’s weaknesses. I am glad to say that that era
is gradually giving way to a time of better feeling, when sympathy and appreciation, fellowship
and coöperation are becoming the watchwords. During the last few years marked progress has
been seen in India in the line of amity and comity between the Protestant Missions of the land.
Recently, a large Conference of Christian Missionaries was convened in Madras representing
the thirty-five Protestant Missions of South India. Missions which formerly held aloof from
their sister missions and declined to fraternize in any way with them, came on this occasion
and heartily joined in the universal good feeling and desire for fellowship among all. Coöperation
was the watchword heard in all discussions at that great Conference; and since that day increasing
effort has been put forth to bring several of the more nearly related of these missions, not
only into coöperation in work, but also into organic unity. For instance the missions of the
Free Church of Scotland and of the Dutch Reformed Church of America have met, through their
representatives, and have perfected a scheme of ecclesiastical union and of coöperation in
work. And already expressions of hearty desire have been made that the missions of the Congregational
denominations unite with these Presbyterian Missions in this Scheme of Union. I believe that
it will require but a short time for the perfecting of such a union among all these kindred
missions. Thus and thus only can we hope to teach to our native Christians the growing oneness
of God’s people; and thus also do we hope to reduce considerably the expenses of the work in
that land. For, by thus uniting our forces, we shall be able to reduce the number of our special
institutions for the training of our agency and the development of our work. Nothing can further
the cause of economy in mission lands today more than the union of mission institutions now
built on denominational lines and expensively conducted in all the missions. I believe in denominationalism.
It has its mission in the world and has done much good. But a narrow, selfish, denominationalism
on the mission field, and in the presence both of the infant native church and of the inquiring
Hindu community, is one of the most serious evils that can befall the cause of Christ in India.

We should all pray for the day when all narrowness in this matter shall yield to the broadest
sympathy, love and coöperation. And, perhaps, the best way to answer our prayers in this matter
is by furthering the noble cause of Christian union among the denominations and churches here
at home.

The old illustration, taken from the rice fields of South India, is apt and instructive. These
fields are small and divided by low banks. The banks serve the purpose of separating the fields
of different persons, of furnishing water channels and of facilitating the irrigation. When
the crops are young and low every field is seen marked out by its banks. But as the crops grow
the banks are hidden and we see nothing but one great expense of waving grain ready for the
harvest. So, while the useful, denominational banks which have divided us in mission lands
are still there we thank God that they are being hidden more, year by year, as the harvest
of Christian love and fellowship is approaching.

3. The organic structure of a mission in the early stages of its growth is a very simple thing;
as it achieves increasing success the necessities of the situation compel it to add to its
efficiency by widening its scope and increasing its functions and multiplying its departments
of work. A hundred years ago, or less, as the missionary entered virgin soil and began to cultivate
a new mission field, he devoted himself, almost exclusively, to the work of preaching the gospel
to the heathen. Presently the gospel message found entrance into the hearts of a few and they
were formed into a congregation. At once he began to train this infant congregation and selected
one or more of the most promising of its number for special instruction and initiation into
the duties of Christian service. He then took this nucleus of a native agency with himself
on preaching tours until new accessions to the faith were gained and new congregations established.
As the congregations multiplied his work as an evangelist had to give way, in part, to his
efforts to train an adequate native agency to guide and nourish the growing Christian community.
There was also added to this the pastoral care and superintendence of congregations new and
old. Later on he felt the need of schools to train the young of his congregations; he also
began to realize the value of educational work for non-Christians as a means of presenting
to them the gospel of Christ. Thus a system of schools was gradually established, both for
Christians and for non-Christians which not only required his care, but also demanded a force
of Christian teachers adequate to this increasing work. So, institutions for the systematic
training of teachers and preachers had to be established. Under the influence of these schools
intelligence grew apace and was suitably met and satisfied by a developing Christian literature—a
literature which met the needs of the Christian and heathen alike.

Moreover as he studied the physical condition of the surrounding people he was appalled by
the prevalence of disease and the inadequacy, yea, even the evil, of the system of medical
treatment which obtained there; and so his heart was drawn out to the need of making some provision
for modern medical aid. As the community continued to grow and the number of young people multiplied,
in church and congregation alike, he became impressed with the need of organizations whereby
this latent youthful power might be conserved, increased and utilized for the Glory of God.

In this way the primitive missions of the past have actually developed into the powerful organizations
of the present. One must study, on the spot, one of the larger missions of India today in order
to appreciate what a complicated organism it is. He then will see how it has sent out its ramifications
into all departments of life and of Christian activity. It has laid its hands, in organized
power, upon every department of Christian work which can be made to contribute to the furtherance
of the cause of Christ in that field. In this way have come into existence the following departments,
which are represented in more or less fullness in all the missions of India today.

(a) The Evangelistic Department.

This, as we have seen, is the oldest as it is the most fundamental, of all organized missionary
activities. And it should retain its prominence in missionary effort. It was preëminently the
method of Christ. He was the Heavenly Messenger proclaiming that the Kingdom of God was at
hand. He was first of all the great Preacher; “and the people everywhere heard Him gladly.”
The missionary of the Cross never feels that he is more directly in the footsteps of his Master
than when he is preaching to the unchurched and Christless masses. There is to this work a
joy and an exhilaration which are peculiarly its own, even though it is a work fraught with
physical weariness. I have felt, in the prosecution of this work, more satisfaction than almost
in any other. Not that I regard it as the most successful form of labour. It is not. Even as
a direct evangelizing agency, I believe that it must yield precedence in India to school-work.
The faithful Christian teacher is now a more successful evangelist in that land than the preacher
himself. And yet the preacher reaches and offers light and gracious opportunity to the more
benighted and the more neglected members of the community. Without making special choice of
any favoured class he sows broadcast the seed, preaches the divine Word, praying that the Lord
himself, who also preached to the common people, bestow his richest blessing upon the labour
which he has done in his name.

This work of preaching Christ to those who know him not, must be carried on by missionaries
and agents. It is usually the custom to expect that every mission agent shall devote some of
his time in visiting neighbouring villages and in gathering the people together and in presenting
to them, in all simplicity, the message of salvation. Frequently these teachers, catechists
and pastors take with them some of the members of their congregations to help them, by song
and by the influence of their presence, to present their message effectively to the people;
and thus the Christians also receive a most useful training in this elementary part of Christian
service.

From time to time special itineracies are conducted by a band of mission agents who will spend
a week or more in traversing a whole region, preaching in every village and street as they
pass along their journey. These itineracies are conducted in various ways, but are always most
helpful in the evangelization of the district.

Some of the best organized missions are adding emphasis to this work by devoting missionaries
specially to the conduct of it. These men gather bands of native preachers around them who
spend their time and strength in preaching and in disseminating gospel truth in the neglected
regions of their fields.

Theological seminaries also give a part of their time to this excellent work. The seminary,
with which I am connected, gave, during the year 1900, five weeks to village work. Teachers
and students travelled hundreds of miles among the villages of the neglected part of the field
and carried the message to more than 50,000 people. This was not only a joyful service, it
was also a most helpful experience to the young students while undergoing their theological
training.

But, as the native Church, in a mission, grows in numbers and in intelligence, the work of
evangelism becomes its special duty. If the Church does not enter, with added joy and power,
into this department of its work; and if it does not voluntarily assume, with ever increasing
fullness, this form of Christian activity, there is something radically wrong about it. It
should be the prayer and purpose of the missionary that every church and congregation established
by him become a centre of evangelistic power, whence will radiate divine light and heat into
adjacent hamlets and villages. I am glad to say that, so far as my observation goes, the native
Church is undertaking this work with increasing zeal and with a growing impulse from within,
rather than by pressure from without. In the Madura Mission, through the Home Missionary Society
and its auxiliaries, and through the organizations of the native women, at least eighteen men
and women are being supported for this especial work of evangelism. And the number of members
of churches, who engage voluntarily in this work, is every year growing.

The character of this preaching is a matter of importance. In India it should be, largely,
if not exclusively, constructive rather than destructive. Forces destructive to a belief in
Hinduism and its numberless superstitions have multiplied wonderfully in that land during the
last fifty years. So that there is no necessity, today, that the Christian preacher spend any
of his time in attacking the errors and evils of the ancestral faith of the people. He should
give himself to the more agreeable and blessed work of imparting the living truth of the Gospel
in all directness and simplicity. The destructive agencies of the civilization, knowledge and
religious institutions of the West have accomplished their work and have made straight the
pathway of the Gospel Messenger into the mind and heart of the people. Thus, it is not the
abuse of the old, but the exposition of the new, faith which should occupy the time of the
preacher to Hindus today. It has been my own custom, and I always urge it upon my students,
to avoid the temptation of attacking Hinduism, and to preach a simple Gospel of salvation.

(b) Pastoral Work.

The rapidly increasing number of churches and congregations has added much to the pastoral
duties of a mission. Formerly missionaries themselves acted as pastors and shepherded the flocks
in the villages. Even today some of the German missions have missionary pastors. But this is
now exceptional. Missions generally have learned that, for native congregations, native pastors
are essential. They not only are better adapted, by nature and by training, to meet the needs
of the native Church; they are also the only ones that are within the range of the financial
possibilities of self-support. And self-support must be ever held before the church as a high
future blessing and duty of the Christian community.

And yet the day when the pastoral work can be effectively and satisfactorily done by the natives
themselves has hardly arrived. Few native pastors today, and much fewer catechists, are competent,
both on the score of character and of independence, to wisely direct the affairs of their people
and to efficiently preserve church discipline. This is a sad confession to make; but truth
compels me to make it—a truth emphasized more than once by long experience among them. A few
years ago a church within my jurisdiction wished to expel a leading member whom it knew to
be a godless man. He had become a curse to the community, and nothing but excommunication seemed
wise or possible. I visited the church for the purpose of assisting the pastor in the administration
of the Lord’s Supper and of studying the general condition of the church. And we attempted,
congregationally, to discipline this member. The church was asked to vote, in case it thought
wise, to excommunicate the man; but not a hand was raised. The matter was further explained
to them, and all those who were in favour of his expulsion were requested to raise the hand.
Again not a hand was raised! The pastor, thereupon, explained the situation by stating that
the people were afraid of the man and dared not vote against him even though he was not present.
The pastor was himself equally timid in the situation. Thereupon I asked those of them who
desired that I should act in this matter for the church to raise the hand; whereupon every
hand of pastor and people was immediately raised; and I fulfilled their wish by excommunicating,
in their name, the evil member!

This may or may not be Congregationalism; but it illustrates the fact which I am now dwelling
upon, viz.: that for the present, both pastor and people are unequal to the severe duties of
church discipline. Every month the missionary is confronted with similar situations which reveal
to him the necessity of his presence as a superintending pastor and the urgent need of his
wisdom to direct the affairs of the church, his firmness to put an end to many impossible situations,
and his inspiration to tone up and give backbone to pastors and other agents connected with
him. It should not be forgotten that, while the infant community connected with each mission
has many admirable traits of piety and of character, it is still the victim of great weakness
in matters of purity, of fellowship and of Christian peace. So that if the Church is to be
preserved from many intolerable evils and brought into the noble traits of a Christian character
which will impress itself upon the non-Christian community there must be firm guidance, stern
repression of evil and wise inspiration to good on the part of the native pastoral force under
the bracing influence of missionary guidance. To those who are conversant with the condition
of the native Church in India there is a supreme conviction that its greatest danger lies in
the irregularity of the life of its members and in its want of firm discipline and the preservation
of purity rather than in the fewness of accessions from heathenism. Hence the importance of
the work of shepherding Christ’s feeble flock in that land. The training of suitable native
agents for this work is a duty of paramount importance; and the training must be continued
through their life by the presence of the missionary to guide, restrain and inspire.

(c) The Educational Department.

In large, well-organized missions, the educational department is now perhaps the most important
and all-pervasive. As a mission grows, this department usually develops more rapidly than any
other of its organized activities. This work is divided into three classes:

Schools for Non-Christians.

These are especially established with a view to reaching and affecting the non-Christian community.
They have developed wonderfully during the last half-century and hold an important place in
the economy of missions. They represent the leaven of Christianity in India. They are preëminently
an evangelistic agency. They furnish excellent opportunity to present Christ and His Gospel
of salvation to a large host of young people under very favorable circumstances. These institutions
are of two classes—primary schools in villages and high schools and colleges at centres of
influence and culture.

They have been the object of attack from men of narrow missionary sympathy and of limited horizon.
These men claim that money expended on such institutions is a waste of mission funds. But they
have failed to recognize the significant fact, which I have already mentioned, that these institutions
undoubtedly furnish the best opportunity for missionary evangelistic work. And I fearlessly
maintain that more conversions take place, and more accessions are made, through these schools
than through any other agency, apart from the Christian Church itself. Not a few of the village
primary schools become nuclei to Christian congregations, which flourish and develop into Christian
churches. And through the higher institutions some of the best and strongest members of the
Christian community have been won from Hinduism. All this, apart from the fact that these institutions
perform an unspeakably important function in the dissemination of light throughout the whole
Hindu community and in the leavening of the whole mass of Hindu thought and institutions. The
good done by this class of institutions is beyond computation in that land.

Schools for Christian Children.

It is the worthy ambition of every mission and missionary to train the children of the Christians
so that they may rise, not only in intelligence, but also in social life and position. Under
this class of schools the native Christian community is being rapidly developed and educated,
so that it is already in advance of any other community in general literacy.

Among these schools for Christians are industrial institutions for the training of boys and
girls in manual labour. At the present time there seems to be a growing tendency to magnify
this department of work. These schools are given to training in carpentry, blacksmithing, weaving,
brass-work, rattan-work, etc. The Germans have entered more fully into this effort than any
other missions in India. But they are not loud in its praise as a department of mission work.
It certainly has both merits and demerits which we shall consider later.

During the last decade a few missionaries have launched out upon a new enterprise in the shape
of Peasant Settlements. One object of these is to train the poor and improvident members of
the community, especially the socially submerged classes, to habits of thrift, economy and
independence. It is also conducted as a philanthropy for the purpose of raising the people
socially and industrially through new methods and forms of agriculture. This movement is still
in its infancy.

Training Institutions for Mission Agents.

It is the duty of every mission to train for itself an efficient class of men and women who
shall conduct all the departments of missionary work and gradually relieve the missionary of
many of his duties. These schools are of many kinds corresponding with the various classes
of agencies required.

This may be illustrated by the institutions now found in the Madura Mission. Nearly every one
of the twelve out-stations of that mission has a boarding school for Christian boys and girls.
The best students who graduate from these schools, especially those who are deemed worthy to
become future candidates for mission service, go to Pasumalai and to Madura for further, and
professional, training. At Pasumalai young men may pass through the High School and even the
college department. They are then placed in the normal department, to qualify them as teachers,
or in the Theological Seminary, to prepare them as preachers and pastors. So, also, girls are
placed in the Madura Girls’ High and Training School and are there qualified for one of three
grades of teachership. Or they may be placed in the Bible Woman’s Training School where they
receive a two-years’ course of training for work as Bible women.

The only class of agents which is not trained by the Madura Mission is that of medical assistants.
I trust that the mission’s desire for funds to establish this work also may be gratified and
that thus we may have the means of training suitable agents for every department of our missionary
work. No mission can be complete unless it has some means of furnishing itself with an efficient
agency to conduct all departments of its activity.

The only danger connected with the excellent educational department of work is, lest it should
outgrow and overshadow all other departments. This danger is at present manifesting itself
in some missions. It is an attractive form of work which allures the missionary; and, for several
reasons, he yields to the temptation of emphasizing it out of proportion to its relative value
and gives more time and money to it than a wise place in mission economy demands. The ideal
arrangement for a mission would seem to be to keep well in front its evangelistic and pastoral
endeavour, and to utilize all forms of educational work with a view to strengthening and furthering
these. It is true that certain missions, like certain individuals, have a special genius or
talent of their own; and their highest success will depend upon their following that bent.
For instance, the Free Church of Scotland, in South India, has shown eminent ability and taste
in the work of education. It has met with distinguished success in that line of effort, and
its college for boys and high schools for girls in Madras bear testimony to its eminent success
in this department. In evangelistic work it has thus far neither shown much interest nor large
aptitude. The Wesleyan Methodists, on the other hand, are born evangelists and find their chief
success as preachers of the gospel. Each mission should not only consider its field and its
claims and needs, it should also study its own corporate gift and bent and then strive to develop
its work mainly upon those lines which are most congenial to it.

(d) Literary Work.

The creation and circulation of a healthy Christian literature has always been recognized by
our missions as a work of paramount importance. While not many missionaries have devoted themselves
exclusively to this work, yet not a little has been accomplished in it by the missions. If
not much that is original and brilliant has issued from the missionary pen; and if it stands
sadly true that too few have seriously undertaken this work; it is nevertheless a cause of
thanksgiving that Christian truth has been extensively expounded and defended by them, and
that they have sent forth from the press a continual stream of blessing to all the people.

In India, three strong societies aid the missions by engaging directly in the production and
dissemination of Christian literature. These are the Bible Society, the Tract Society and the
Christian Literature Society. These institutions have spent large sums of money in the translation,
revision and circulation of the Holy Scriptures and in the furnishing of fresh, readable and
informing tracts and books in explanation, illustration and defense of Christianity. The far-reaching
results of the work of these societies no one can adequately estimate. The need of this department
of work is not only great, it is growing annually. Missions feel this keenly and are unwilling
to depend entirely upon the above mentioned societies. Each mission of any importance has one,
or more, printing establishments with which it can prepare and issue tracts and books of its
own, and whereby it may present special truths and teachings which seem to it urgently needed
by its people. Through these presses the missions publish also 147 newspapers and magazines
for the special use of the Christian people and others. In this way forty-one printing establishments,
employing no fewer than 2,000 men, are utilized by the Protestant missions of India in the
production of healthy literature for the furtherance of the cause of Christ in that land.

In this department two special classes are kept in view. The growing Christian community must
be provided with suitable books in the vernaculars. Books devotional for the mass of Christians,
and text-books for the students in our professional schools, and helpful books of instruction
for the large body of Christian agents are needed. All these make an increasing demand upon
the literary fertility of writers and authors on the mission field.

There is also a growing demand, and an urgent need, for good books adapted to the non-Christian
community—such tracts and books as can present to them, in an attractive and convincing way,
the special truths and the supreme excellence of our faith. The number is annually increasing,
both among native Christians and in the non-Christian community, of those who can read and
whose taste for books is growing.

This method of approach to the mind of the people has peculiar advantages of its own. The prejudices
connected with Christian instruction, as it proceeds directly from the lips of the teacher
or preacher, does not exist in connection with tracts and books. These printed messengers of
truth and salvation quietly and effectively do their work in the silent hours of the night
and in the secret recesses of the woods or of the solitary chamber. And this message is the
more effective because it may be read and pondered more than once, until its truth grips the
soul in convicting and saving power.

The power of the printed page, as a Christian messenger in India, is second to none at present;
and its influence will multiply mightily as the years increase. Missions and individual missionaries
should enter more fully into this work; none needs increasing emphasis more than this; and
none has larger hopes of preëminence in the great work of India’s redemption. Missionary societies
also should devote more men, than in the past, to the creation of a strong Christian literature.

And even where missions are too weak to publish anything of their own and are unable to write
books or tracts; there is a wide field of usefulness open to them in a thoroughly systematic
and energetic work of distributing the existing literature produced by the great societies.
In some missions this work of circulating Scriptures and Christian books has been reduced almost
to a science and has become an exceedingly efficient help to the cause in those districts.
Other missions have yet to learn the importance and blessing of this activity.

(e) Medical Work.

This department of missionary effort has a wide sphere of usefulness. Though not so urgently
necessary now as in former times in India, owing to the ubiquitous and efficient Government
Medical Department, it is nevertheless popular and very useful. This is specially so when the
whole work and its agency are brought into full subjection to the Christian, as distinct from
the purely humanitarian, motive. No other department is more capable of being utilized as an
evangelizing agency; and in many missions its influence is thus widely felt. Everywhere its
aid to other departments of mission work is much appreciated through its ability to gain friends
for our cause among those who would otherwise be inimical; and in preparing the hearts of many
to receive spiritual help from the Great Physician. No fewer than forty hospitals, besides
many dispensaries, are conducted by Protestant missions in India today. Many of the medical
missionaries give their whole time to this work; others conduct the medical as only one of
the departments of their missionary activity. To each method there are advantages and disadvantages;
though, perhaps, the medical missionary finds greatest usefulness when he gives himself entirely
to his profession as physician. But, in that case, he needs tenfold caution lest the distinctively
missionary idea of his life-work should be subjected to, or lost in, the professional and the
humanitarian spirit.

Medical work for women and children finds in India today perhaps its most urgent call. There
is more need and suffering among them than among men.

(f) Work for Women.

From the first, missions have not neglected woman. She has been their care, and her conversion
and elevation their ambition. But, in recent times, much has been added to this. Not only have
separate and definite forms of work been opened for women; organized work by women in their
behalf has suddenly taken high rank and attained considerable popularity among Christian peoples.
Under Women’s Missionary Societies fully 1,000 ladies have come to India and are giving themselves
exclusively to work for their Indian sisters. All forms of effort are undertaken in their behalf.
Assisted by an army of thousands of native Bible women, Zenana workers and mistresses, these
ladies perform their noble service. Hindu homes are daily and everywhere visited, and the seed
of Christian life and truth sown; thousands of non-Christian girls and young women are instructed
and initiated into the mysteries of Bible truth and Christian life; and Christian womanhood
is being developed, more rapidly indeed than Christian manhood, into a thing of strength and
beauty. In the town of Madura alone thirty-one Bible women have access to 1,000 non-Christian
homes where Bible instruction is gladly received. Another staff of twenty-one Christian workers
instructs daily, in five schools, 500 Hindu and Mohammedan girls. Also a High and Training
school for Christian girls, with 256 pupils; and a Bible woman’s training school, with seventeen
students, complete this organized work for women in that town. From it, as a centre, seventeen
other women visit and work in seventy-two different villages and instruct 1,005 pupils. No
work at present is more important or finds more encouragement than this organized activity
for women.

(g) Work for the Young.

Ours is preëminently the age of youth—the time when the importance of work for the young is
fully appreciated, and when manifold activities are put forth by the Christian Church in their
behalf. During recent years such activity has been extensively introduced into mission fields.
In India at present, Y. M. C. A., Y. W. C. A., Y. P. S. C. E., Epworth League, Sunday-school
Union and a host of other less-known organizations for the young have established themselves
and are working with much enthusiasm. In former years little was done for the young of the
infant Christian communities. The old Oriental idea that young people are of no account, and
that effort in their behalf is hardly worth while, obtained in India until recent years. The
consequence was that the children of Christian congregations were neglected and allowed to
absent themselves from Christian services and to grow up in ignorance and heathenish darkness.
As a result of this many of these boys and girls, when they grew up into manhood and womanhood,
reverted to heathenism; and many flourishing Christian congregations of the last generation
became defunct. It is now understood, with increasing distinctness, that the permanent success
and growth of a Christian congregation, as of the whole Christian community, depends more upon
the effort which is exercised in behalf of the young than upon any amount of labour lavished
upon those of maturer years. Hence, more activity, of an organized type, is being wisely put
forth in behalf of the children and of young people. The more plastic, responsive, tenacious
mind of the young takes in more readily, appreciates more keenly and clings with more persistence
to religious instruction and inspiration imparted to it than does that of the older members
of the community. The Christian worker thus finds earlier and greater fruit to his labour among
the young than among the old. Any enthusiasm imparted by him to the young people is also, sooner
or later, apt to be carried by them to the older members of the congregation or church. The
hope of the Church in India lies in the young people; and that missionary, or native agent,
who can best organize the young into useful forms of outgoing Christian activity, will do most
for the Church of the present and future. And, while so excellent an agency as the Christian
Endeavor Society is available for use in this line of work, the missionary need not be discouraged,
but may feel confident that he has within his power an organization rich in promise of blessing
to his whole community.

(h) Organizations for the Special Activities of the Native Christian Community.

Every mission should encourage all forms of wise and necessary organization for the furtherance
of the highest life of the community itself. And this chiefly with a view to developing self-dependence
in the community. These organizations will be naturally divided into two classes.

Those Which Promote Self-Government.

The Christian Church in the mission field should be organized ecclesiastically and administratively
in such a way that it may ultimately, and as speedily as may seem wise, become entirely self-governing.
Every mission should aim to so teach the people that they may control and conduct successfully
their own affairs. It should establish a Church which sends its roots deep into the soil of
the land and which will become, in the highest sense, indigenous. One of the necessary evils
of missionary life is the early Western control and guidance of everything. I should like to
see the day, when the native Church can establish that polity which is most congenial to its
taste and run its affairs independently and on Oriental lines, in such a way as to win more
effectively the people of India to Christ. The question is sometimes asked,—“Must our Congregational
missions bind, to our Congregational form of ecclesiastical government, the people whom they
bring over from heathenism? Must our church polity, in the mission field, be Congregational,
or Presbyterian, etc., regardless of its adaptation, or want of adaptation, to the people?”
The affirmative answer has usually been given by all societies (and wrongly I think) to this
inquiry; and thus every denomination transplants into heathen lands, with renewed emphasis,
not only its own peculiar shibboleths of doctrine; it also exalts to a heavenly command the
government and ritual which it represents.

Missions in India are conscientiously endeavouring, with varying degrees of wisdom and success,
to lead forward their people in the line of self-government. But both love of power and a conviction
of the inability of the infant Church to wisely control its affairs, combine to render this
transfer of power from the mission to the native Church a very slow matter—more slow than seems
wise to many besides the leaders of the native Church themselves. It is a significant fact,
in India today, that the Methodist missions, by their compact organization, are able to, or
at any rate do, confer more ecclesiastical and administrative power upon the native Church
than any other mission; while Congregational missions—the least organized—are the most backward
in this matter. A study for the causes of this would be instructive.

Those Organisations Which Promote Self-Extension.

One of the first things that a mission should do, after gathering the Christian community,
is to organize, in the community, such activities as are outreaching and self-extending. In
the Madura Mission there has been for many years a Home Missionary Society whose aim is to
help support weak churches and also maintain a force of evangelists to preach to non-Christians.
It is the society of the native Christians—supported and largely directed by them. It has created,
maintained and increased the interest of the people in furthering the cause of Christ.

Many such societies exist in India today and they render valuable service in keeping before
the mind of the people the deepest characteristics of our faith and the highest privilege of
a Christian community—that of outgoing love, and self-extending enthusiasm.

Those Organisations Which Further Self-Support.

How extensively should the idea of self-support be at present urged upon the native Christian
community? This is a question which we will discuss later on. There is no question however
but that every mission should so organize its benevolences that the infant Church may, at as
early a date as possible, cease to seek support from a foreign land; and that it cultivate
at the same time a spirit of self-denial and of self-reliance. The poverty of the people is,
and will long remain, a serious barrier to this consummation. But the evil of poverty may be
counterbalanced by a careful system whereby the benevolent feelings, generous impulses and
the sense of obligation of the people are conserved, strengthened and made fully effective.
This matter should not be left to haphazard or to spasmodic appeal. Every Christian, even the
poorest, should be so directed and inspired in his benevolence that he may effectively contribute
to the worthy object of self-support.

These three desiderata of the native Christian Church—self-support, self-propagation and self-government—are
to be desired above all other blessings by the missions and should be sought with a persistence
and a well-organized intelligence, which will mean advance and ultimate success. When these
three have been attained, missions, with all their expensive machinery, may gladly disband
and feel that their end has been accomplished and that they are no longer needed.

                               Chapter IX.

PRESENT DAY MISSIONARY PROBLEMS.

Every age has its own problems to solve; and so has every department of life. The problems
which belong to missionary life, method and work are many. The permanence and future success
of the missionary effort of the Church of God depends upon the wise solution of these problems.
Nowhere is this more manifest than in India. In that land Christian effort for the conversion
of the people has been made for many centuries by numerous nationalities and Christian communities
with varying success or want of success. Unwillingness or an inability to thoroughly confront
and master the deep problems of the field, the work and the people, with a view to adapting
Christianity to them has largely been the cause of the slow progress of our faith in that land.
Successive efforts by the Greek, the Syrian, the Romish and the Protestant Churches have not
been prolific in marked and permanent results, simply because they have not adequately studied
the novel and strange conditions of the land and the best methods of presenting Christ and
His truth.

We need in India, today, highest wisdom in order to establish worthy missions, and to conduct
them in the right and best way so as to attain results commensurate with the resources of the
kingdom and of the great King whose we are and whom we preach.

The missionary problems of today are many.

1. The initial and preliminary question as to the right of the Christian Church to send forth
its missionaries, and to establish its missions in heathen lands.

This question is now raised by many. They ask it because they believe in the integrity of the
doctrine of evolution. “Why do you not,” they say, “leave those non-Christian peoples to work
out their own salvation through a natural evolution of their own faiths? Let those old crude
religions pass into something higher through the natural process of evolution rather than resort
to the cataclysmic method of over-throwing the old and introducing a faith that is entirely
foreign. Why not let the process of growth work out its own results even though it takes a
long time for it?”

This objection to our work is modern and thoroughgoing. Of course it is equally pronounced
against supernaturalism in all its forms and ramifications. It would be futile to reply to
this by appealing to the command of our Lord to go and disciple all nations. It is enough to
remind this objector that the doctrine of evolution admits that the highest altruism is a part
of the evolution process. And if that is so, then the highest Christian altruism must find
its noblest exercise in the work of bringing, by Christians to non-Christians, those ideas
and that life which they deem the best and of which those outside of Christ stand in urgent
need. The highest evolution of our race has been, and ever must be, through that Christian
altruism which will not rest until the noblest truth and the fullest life are brought to all
the benighted souls of our race. Is not this the last message of evolution to us at this present?
And is it not identical with the last commission of our Lord to His followers—to go and disciple
the nations? And while it is the function of Christianity to maintain the evolution principle
of the survival of the fittest, it does this by indirection—by seizing upon the most unfit
and unworthy and making them fit to stand before God and worthy to enjoy the life eternal in
all its glory.

Moving a step forward we come to,—

Another problem kindred to the one mentioned—one which concerns the aims and the results which
should animate missionary endeavour.

2. What shall a man or a mission entertain as a motive or as an aim to be attained and as results
worthy of achievement in missionary work?

This question also is based upon and will cover very largely the character of the work accomplished.

There are two distinct and separate motives and aims impelling Christians, at the present time,
to missionary effort. They are, in the main, an emphasis given, respectively, to each of Christ’s
two final commands to his disciples upon earth.

In the first instance his last commission to his followers to go and make disciples of the
nations is taken as the watch-word; and this has always meant thorough, patient, all-inclusive
effort for the redemption and elevation of all the races of the earth.

The other class has taken as its watch-word our Lord’s last utterance upon earth—“Ye shall
be My witnesses.” “Witness-bearing” has become to them the expression of the Church’s great
duty to the world.

There is a great difference between these two classes of aims and motives, and they are associated
with two classes of theological thinking. According to the former theory the Kingdom of our
Lord, under the dispensation of the Holy Spirit, is to spread in regenerating power and triumphant
efficacy until all the nations of the earth shall come under its sway. This is a great and
arduous undertaking. The planting of this Kingdom in heathen lands and the discipling of those
people until the Church of God shall have become a living and a self-propagating church in
all the regions of the earth is a work of ages, worthy of the combined effort of heaven and
earth. And this consummation will surely take place. God has promised it; Christ’s work involves
it; the Holy Spirit came into the world for its realization. They who entertain this belief
are Christian optimists. No reverses can daunt them; no opposition can discourage them. They
lay broad and deep the foundations of their work and labour patiently but hopefully for the
great and final consummation.

Those, on the other hand, who are pessimistic as to the triumph of the Kingdom of Christ under
the dispensation of the Spirit, maintain, with exclusive emphasis, the Christian duty of witness-bearing.
They claim, in Dr. Pierson’s words, that our mission to the heathen world should be one of
diffusion and not of concentration; that we should bear witness concerning Christ to the people
who know Him not and then pass on to others, rather than remain to expand, to convert, to train
and to establish living churches. They maintain that our duty is preëminently to bear witness
to Christ, that we have no responsibility for the conversion of the people and for the building
up of strong churches.

This claim that it is the duty of the Church to herald the good news of redemption to all men
as speedily as possible apart from the expectation that they will accept it: does not commend
itself to me either upon Scriptural grounds or upon grounds of reason.

The idea of preaching the gospel to the heathen “for a witness,” in the ordinary acceptance
of that term, does not constitute a worthy Christian motive. Dr. W. N. Clark well analyzes
this thought in the following words, (page 53, in “Study of Christian Missions”),—“At the outset,
there is one motive, often, though not necessarily, associated with the theory of heralding,
that must be rejected as no Christian motive. It is often held that in this rapid work the
gospel is not to be preached mainly in order that it may be believed unto salvation, but rather
‘for a witness,’—which is taken to mean ‘for a witness against,’ the hearers when they meet
the judgment of God. The hearing of the gospel marks a turning-point, both in experience and
destiny. When once men have heard the gospel, they will be saved if they believe, and justly
condemned if they do not. Only a few will be saved by the missionary preaching; the elect will
be gathered out of the mass, and the many will remain indifferent. But the blame of their ruin
will be upon themselves, not upon God or the Christian people; and it is to insure this result
that the gospel is preached to them for a witness. But this is no Christian truth. Such teaching
cannot truly represent the motive of God the Saviour. We must maintain that God acts in good
faith in the offers of His grace, or Christianity becomes a delusion. We must preserve our
own good faith also in conveying the offer of grace, or our hearers will rise in the judgment
to condemn us. No allowance should be made for any such unchristian motive in our plans for
Christian missions, and we must hold no theory of missions that implies it.”

Moreover the view is thoroughly pessimistic, so far as this dispensation is concerned, and
fails to realize the power and the glory of Christian truth and of the kingdom of Christ as
inspired by the Holy Spirit. A theory of missions which is pessimistic at the core can hardly
be a safe or an inspiring one.

It should be remembered also that missions are not an end in themselves. They should aim at
making themselves unnecessary by the establishing of vigorous churches which shall become self-extending
and indigenous in all the lands of the earth. The hope of missions, and the hope of the world
through missions, lies not, ultimately, in the missions, but in the churches which they establish.
Therefore they should be well established and patiently developed. The Church of God must take
up its missionary work with a full appreciation of its supreme greatness and difficulty. Let
it not be supposed that it is called simply to “bear witness.” This heralding of the gospel
of Christ, is only a part, and indeed a small part, of the great duty of the Church to the
world. It is also specifically, and with greater urgency, called upon to disciple the nations—to
bring them into full possession of saving truth and into joyful acceptance of, and life in, Christ.

Let us not delude ourselves with the idea that this work is easy, that we can pass over it
lightly or that we have no responsibility for the conversion of the world. As I have preached
for the first time to a heathen village I have felt that my obligation to its inhabitants for
their salvation was thereby increased rather than fulfilled. There is no doubt that Christian
missionaries realize today as never before the greatness of the task set before God’s people
to disciple the nations. The obstacles to it and the conflict which it involves seem greater
than ever. The romance of missions has largely given way to sober work and the rush of battle
has been succeeded by a great siege. This is preëminently the condition in India today. Let
us not forget this in our missionary enterprise lest we lose courage by the way. But let us
also remember that it is God’s work. He is pledged to bring it to its ultimate triumph, and
He will do it. He will fulfill His promise and give to His Son the heathen for His inheritance
and the uttermost parts of the earth for His possession.

This theory of missionary work is the only one that has produced, and can maintain, all the
present organized activity of the missionary Church. The aim of the manifold activities and
various departments of missionary effort, as witnessed in India today, can be nothing less
than the ultimate conquest of that land for Christ through the establishment of a living, an
ever-growing and self-extending Indian Church there.

Let us now consider some of the problems which specially exist in India.

3. THE CASTE PROBLEM.

The caste problem has been, and continues to be, the most troublesome and obtrusive among all
the questions which confront missions in that land. It is a more serious problem—more pervasive
and intense—in Southern than in Northern India.

This is radically different from social problems in all other lands, in that it traces its
source to, and gathers its authority from, religion. It enforces all that it sanctions by the
most compact and relentless religious system the world has known. It maintains that men have
been created into a great number of castes or classes from none of which can they, by any possibility,
pass into another. In whatever social stratum a man is born there must he live and die. It
is impious for him to attempt to evade or to violate this heavenly classification. His interests
and all his rights are confined to that one caste of his birth. It is sin for him to marry
out of it or, in any way, to transgress his natal compact with it. Neither added wealth, growing
culture, a new ambition, nor anything else can enable him to change his caste. All the forces
of religion are directed, like a mighty engine of tyranny, to bind him to it.

This sentiment of caste, after millenniums of teaching, of rigid observance and custom, has
become even more than second nature to the Hindu,—it has grown into a sweet necessity of his
life, from whose claims and demands he neither expects nor desires relief. To the ordinary
Hindu a change of caste would be as unexpected, yea as impossible, as his sudden change into
the lower brute, or into the higher angelic, kingdom.

When Christianity was first established in India the problem of the adoption or the rejection
of caste by the Christian church had to be faced. It was rejected by the earliest Christian
community in India; for we find no traces of it in the Syrian church on the coast of Malabar
today. Even caste titles, that dearest remnant of that system to all other native Christians
in India, have entirely disappeared from that community. It is a great pity that the history
of that victory over caste has not been preserved as a lesson and a heritage to later Christians.

The Romish Church, which next invaded India, unfortunately despised the Syrian community, sought
no instruction from its history, made a friend of the caste system and adopted it in all its
hideousness. It did not wait to consider the terrible fact, so patent to all at present, that
Hinduism and caste are convertible terms—that one cannot cease to be a Hindu who maintains
the caste system in its integrity. Its intention was, no doubt, good in its way. It was an
effort to make an easy way out of Hinduism into Christianity and thus to swell the tide of
incoming converts. But, unfortunately, the path was made too easy; the narrow gate was sufficiently
enlarged for the Hindu to enter with his burden of heathen prejudices and superstitions, and
it soon became the highway of insincerity and hypocrisy. Moreover, the Romish Church has found,
to its cost, that an easy way from Hinduism to Christianity is an equally easy path to return.
A man who carried much of his Hinduism with him into the Christian Church was easily drawn
back by the remaining old ties and affections. The consequence is that, while Romanism has
made large inroads upon Hinduism in some places, it has only been for a time; and the back-sliders
have been as numerous as the new converts; so that Roman Catholicism has made little net progress
in India for many years.

This alliance which Christianity made, four centuries ago, with caste was, thus, a fatal one.
It gave also a clue to the earliest Protestant missionaries—a clue which they, in a weak moment,
decided to follow. For, the first Danish missionaries also made a sad compromise with this
monster evil. I presume that this may be regarded as a continental failing of that day, when
in Europe class differences were great and almost insurmountable. Human rights and individual
liberty were not held so sacred, or so scrupulously defended, in Europe in those days as they
are in Anglo-Saxon countries today. Otherwise any alliance by the Church with the caste system
would have been an impossibility in India. Even today some Protestant missionaries from the
European continent are found in India who defend the adoption of the caste system by the Christian
Church. How different would have been the attitude of the Protestant Church towards this heathenish
institution had men of the Anglo-Saxon type of today rather than Continentals of two centuries
ago started its work in South India! In any case, the attitude of compromise assumed towards
the caste system in those early days has led to interminable evil and to constant trouble in
the Christian Church in that land.

After caste had first found admission as a friend and then was discovered to be an uncompromising
enemy to Christian life and principles, much effort was made to expel it. Nearly all Protestant
missions now denounce it, root and branch, and preach against it, and in various ways try to
check and to cast it out. But with no great success thus far. The false step taken at the beginning
has cost the Church terribly. Today in South India more than nine-tenths of all Protestant
native Christians, while they seek an alliance only among Christians, nevertheless marry not
on lines of Christian affinity so much as on Hindu caste lines. It is not often that we find
a man among common Christians who has courage and sense enough to seek a match for son or daughter
outside of the limits of that caste to which he and his people belonged in Hinduism. This custom
is found not only extremely inconvenient and troublesome to them; worst of all, it perpetuates,
in the Christian fold, the old heathen lines of cleavage. And thus life in the Christian community
is still running somewhat in the old channels of Hinduism and largely preserves those social
distinctions of the past which should have been buried with them at baptism and forever abandoned.

Under these circumstances what should missions do? What should be their attitude towards caste
spirit and customs? Through former misapprehension and neglect the evil is in the Christian
Church and exercises a potent influence. How shall it be overcome or expelled? Some believe
in the laissez faire method. They maintain that, if left to itself for a time, it will die
out, or the general spirit of Christianity will naturally drive it out. The spirit of caste
is not exorcised in that way. So long as it is perpetuated by marriage affinity, the source
of the whole evil, and by habits of eating together on caste lines, it will not diminish very
much or cease to torment the Church. A century of such waiting, in some missions that I have
known, finds the evil not much diminished. It is only in those missions where it is attacked
and constantly denounced and its terrible evils exposed, that progress is evident.

That which can do speedy and sure work, in the destruction of this evil in Christian missions
is inter-caste marriage. And through this I am glad to see that increasing good is wrought.
Missions should in every way encourage and put a premium upon marriages among their members
from different castes. They should teach frequently and emphatically that membership in different
castes does not constitute a prohibited marriage relationship; but rather does it furnish the
best ground for marriage. In this way, and in this way only, will this wretched caste feeling
speedily die a natural death and Christians come to marry, eat, sympathize, love and live on
Christian, rather than on Hindu, lines. A mission which does not improve every opportunity
to show its hatred of the caste system and to antagonize it positively and persistently can
find no peace; nor will it find any permanent prosperity. Missions are feeling this increasingly
and are acting accordingly.

4. SELF-SUPPORT OF MISSIONS.

Every mission seeks, as its ever-present ambition, to attain unto independence from all outside
financial aid and a thorough self-support of its own institutions. We await the day, and believe
in its no distant coming, when a large number of mission churches will entirely support their
own institutions. Indeed there are now many churches, on mission ground, that have grown into
self-dependence and that maintain, at their own expense, all those normal forms of work that
are connected with Christian activity.

The question is frequently asked,—how far shall missions place before them, as the supreme
and immediate aim, the self-support of their separate churches? Among missions and missionaries
there are two tendencies in this matter. One class, represented by the Church Missionary Society
Mission in Tinnevelly, place all moneys received from their mission churches into one fund,
and from this fund they pay the salaries of the pastors and catechists, so far as possible.
Bishop Sargent told me that he did not think any church should be allowed to directly support
its own pastor lest they consider that thereby they had a right to exercise authority over
him! That mission, therefore, and for other reasons also, has relegated the direct question
of the self-support of each church into the limbo of the undesirable. In the American Madura
Mission, on the other hand, the responsibility is urged upon every individual church to support
its own spiritual instructor; and all rules and methods are directed towards emphasizing and
enforcing this. Self-support thus becomes, in that mission, its ever-present cry and the growing
ambition of its every church and congregation. And the progress of the Church and of the mission
is largely measured by this standard.

The self-support of a mission, as such, is a question which is not looked upon with the same
urgency, or with the same idea of importance by all missions, or by all missionaries. One party,
for instance, would make self-support the supreme end; everything else must be subordinated
to it. Nothing should be undertaken, they say, which is not within the means and the desire
of the people to support. For instance, they maintain that the salary of all mission agents
and the support of mission institutions must be pecuniarily within the means of the Orient
and within the limits of its ambitions. I ought to say that no mission, to my knowledge, carries
out this principle in its integrity, although there are some missionaries who urge it and proclaim
it at all times.

The other party believes that the principal duty and highest privilege of a mission, as such,
is not immediately to seek self-support or to pare everything down to the capacity of the people
to give; but to push forward the work energetically; with economy indeed, but regardless of
expense, knowing that vigour and enterprise and a strenuous Western energy today will be both
amply rewarded in results and will also set a pace for the native Church in coming years. They
therefore seek the best trained agents regardless of the immediate ability of the people to
pay their salary. And they establish schools and hospitals and various other institutions which
are altogether beyond the present ability of the Indian Church either to found or to maintain.

We must not forget that self-support, entire self-support, is possible in any mission from
the very first day of its organization, if the mission only makes this paramount and has the
boldness of its convictions to shape its work according to the offerings of the people. And
there are some advantages to that method. Many of the best missionaries have often felt that
they would like to try that system in India. Bishop Thoburn, while maintaining that it would
be impossible to radically change the method of an old mission, expressed the conviction that
it might be well to establish in India a new mission on the basis of complete self-support
from the beginning. This, doubtless, was the Pauline method; and it operated well under the
then existing circumstances in those lands. And had our missions in the East been established
and conducted by the Orient instead of the Occident they would have had adequate patience to
pursue the method of self-support ab initio. But as we are of the West, Western, our missions
must partake of the characteristics of our nature; and be imbued with that energy, push, impatience
for results which distinguish us in everything. I am sure that neither the churches at home
nor their missionaries abroad are prepared to limit their efforts by the poverty, slowness
and apathy of the East, and thus perhaps delay for years, or generations, the results which,
through the expenditure of more money, they possibly might reap today. The method which missions
have adopted is the western method, characteristic of our haste and strenuous spirit, and partaking
of the evils incident to that spirit and method. It is, on the whole, perhaps the best method
that can be used and fully realized by us.

5. MISSION EDUCATIONAL WORK.

In connection with the increasingly important department of mission educational work in India
not a few perplexing questions arise. We have seen that this department has conquered for itself
general recognition as a legitimate part of missionary effort.

But there is a serious conflict ahead, in the not distant future. And this is in part owing
to the attitude of the Government Educational Department and of the local governing bodies
towards mission institutions. There is no concealing the fact that most of the English officials
of the Educational Department in India deem mission schools the most serious rivals to, and
regard missionary educators as quasi enemies of, their departmental schools. These men have
recently assumed, and are increasingly assuming, an attitude of jealousy, if not of hostility,
to mission institutions, chiefly because of their strength and excellence as rival schools,
and partly because of the Bible training which is imparted to all the students of these schools—a
training with which those officials have no sympathy and which they are wont to regard as an
educational impertinence.

Missions must expect that the jealousy and the antagonism of that department will increase.
It is true that the great State Educational Despatch of 1854 and later enunciated government
policy, declare that it is not the purpose of the government to establish schools of its own,
except where private bodies fail to do so; and that it is its purpose to encourage, so far
as possible, private institutions. But the general declaration of the Imperial and Provincial
governments is one thing and the purpose and ambition of its Educational Department a very
different thing. Departmentalists find it to their interest to strengthen and increase government
schools at all points; and as the funds appropriated for educational purposes are inadequate
for all schools they seek the lion’s share for their own, and grudgingly give an ever decreasing
quota to mission institutions. It will be an ill day for missions when the Educational Department
and its schools will become sufficiently strong to affect the policy of the general government
as against private, and in favour of government schools.

Another fact, of equal significance, is the attitude of District Boards and Municipal Commissioners
towards the schools of Mission Bodies. Nearly all the members of Local Boards are native gentlemen.
They see the large influence of mission schools, scattered as they are through their districts
and towns, and they regard them as Christian propaganda and as evangelizing agencies; and it
is but natural that, under the impulse of their new nationalism and of their interest in a
Neo-Hinduism, they should be jealous of mission schools which are the rivals of their own indigenous
and growing institutions. And as they have the power of the purse and make and withhold grants
to different schools at their pleasure; and as all the subordinate officers of the Educational
Department are natives and are not in full sympathy with mission schools; it can be easily
seen how our schools are doomed to suffer through an ever decreasing government aid towards
their support.

Thus, there are two problems, in this connection, which will confront us. One is the question
whether it be worth while for missions to conduct their schools entirely at their own expense,
i.e.—without any government aid. This problem must be faced ere long; and it means either the
curtailing of this department of work or the expending of a very much increased sum of money
upon it.

The question may also be urged upon us, more speedily than we anticipate (indeed it has been
raised already), whether any schools aided by government shall be allowed to be used as religious
propaganda. In other words, whether mission schools shall enjoy the privilege of teaching the
Bible to all non-Christian students in attendance, even against their will. This question is
exercising the mind of not a few natives and others today; and it is claimed that the present
practice is contrary to the Royal Proclamation of Religious Neutrality in the land. There is
some reason for this contention; and, under increasing religious rivalry and jealousy, it may,
at an early date, lead to a crisis in mission schools. And the problem may confront us as to
whether we are prepared to continue all our schools for non-Christians under conditions which
make it impossible for us to give Bible, or even any religious, training in them.

Another serious problem, in this same connection, is whether missions should conduct, to any
extent, educational work apart from other indirect aims and purposes. In other words, how far,
if at all, should a mission give itself to the work of education, per se, and not as a Christian
training or as an evangelizing agency.

Many at present maintain that education—general education—is in itself a good and a blessing
which it is the business of a mission to impart, independent of any direct religious instruction
or spiritual training which might be given through it. They maintain that mission funds should
thus be used for the intellectual advancement of the people apart from their Christianization.
The majority, however, would claim that a mission’s educational work should be conducted only
so far as it can be the medium of communicating religious truth, or only in so far as it can
be made a direct auxiliary to the Christianizing of the land. This class would claim that no
work should be undertaken by a mission which does not contribute to the Christianizing of the
people as a result distinct from their progress in civilization. And it is here that these
two classes of missionaries take issue with each other. It is an important difference in the
conception of the Church’s work in heathen lands. As I shall consider this later I only call
attention to it here.

Another matter, of no little consequence in this connection, is that of the amount of educational
privilege which a mission should furnish to its people. President Stanley Hall has recently
maintained that, even in this country, many are educated who should not be. They should, he
says, be left to the hoe and shovel. He claims that not a few are, through education, spoiled
for usefulness in the lowest sphere of manual labour for which they were by nature designed;
while they are also disqualified for the highest sphere of service and life. If this be true
in America it is doubly true in India. Many young men and women in that land have had lavished
upon them the blessings of education to an extent that was unprofitable both to them and to
the cause. They have received an education and training which not only carried them away far
outside the social realm for which they were intended by nature; it also left them incapable
of doing the higher thing for which they were intended by the mission.

There is adequate excuse for this in the early stages of mission progress. The greatest need
of a mission is a good, strong, native agency. And in its desire to furnish this agency the
mission, as well as the individual missionary, eagerly seizes upon every boy and girl who shows
any signs of promise as an applicant to be trained for missionary service. This same ambition
to develop, in intellectual power and in civilizing progress, the young of an infant Christian
community so that they may adorn our faith and give an honourable status to the community leads
many a mission to expend upon the education of its boys and girls more than it will in its
later and more mature stage of growth.

6. THE INDUSTRIAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEM.

During the last two decades there has been a marked and strong tendency in Indian missions,
as in the home churches which support them, to still broaden the scope of missionary effort
by adding to its directly spiritual, and to its educational and medical, work, schemes for
the industrial, economic and social advancement of the people. This broadening of the conception
of the work of the Church in missionary lands is a most interesting study. Less than a century
ago nothing that was not directly and intensely spiritual in its character was regarded as,
in any sense, a part of missionary effort. To preach the Gospel to the heathen, to establish
and to train Christian churches and to develop and direct a suitable native agency—this embraced
the whole work of the mission. Anything beyond this was considered illegitimate. Subsequently
the medical department was introduced,—chiefly because of the example of Christ Himself as
the Great Healer. Soon the educational work was begun, as a necessity in its elementary stages,
and it gradually grew until it has reached its present manifold character and large proportions.
Then a few missions began to touch the industrial problem and to establish schools for the
training of boys and girls in manual labour. Today that work is finding much increased emphasis,
and missions are beginning to take up, in all seriousness, Peasant Settlements as a means of
lifting the people economically, and of training them to habits of industry, and to found villages
as separate Christian communities. Schools for the blind and for deaf mutes also have been
established. In fact all forms of philanthropic effort have now practically been adopted by
the missions of India as legitimate forms of their activities. Indeed, it is extensively proclaimed,
what has long been strenuously denied, that missions are not founded simply to Christianize
but to civilize and to elevate in all matters pertaining to soul, mind and body, the people
among whom they are established.

This is a broad question and an issue of fundamental importance. It belongs to the very concept
of missions and is largely a question of aim and purpose. The trend of the times is doubtless
in favour of the broader, humanitarian, philanthropic, civilizing purpose of missions as against
the deeper and more exclusive, spiritual and Christianizing end.

It seems to me to be a question whether missions are ready for this change.

It is also a very serious problem whether, in the mission field, this modern tendency to extend
and broaden out is of the spirit of Christ and is a passion to do good unto men in every department
and sphere of their life; or whether it is a degeneracy—a drifting away from the lofty and
exclusive purpose of soul-winning and soul-saving down towards the lower plane of earthly blessing
and general philanthropy. There is certainly a sense in which this widening of missionary endeavour
is a part of the broadening of the Christian life of today and is in harmony with the multiplication
of the agencies of the Church at home for the general betterment of the people and for preparing
them for the highest blessings of our faith; and as such it is both commendable and encouraging.

On the other hand I know of no temptation that is pregnant with greater evil to missions, at
the present time, than that connected with this multiplication of what may be called the lower
activities of missions. The spiritual work of a mission must ever remain its principal work
if it is to succeed in the highest sense. It is also the most difficult work. It bears with
it, often, serious discouragement to the worker. And in times of discouragement it is a very
easy thing for a missionary, and for a mission, to relax effort at this point and, as a compensation,
to seek larger results on the lower planes of social and industrial activities and humanitarian
and philanthropic effort. These lower forms of activity are exceedingly absorbing and distracting;
and when a mission enters extensively into them it usually means, and, I would almost say,
necessarily means, a withdrawal of time and energy and of interest from its highest spiritual
work. A man or a mission has only a certain amount of strength and money to devote to his work;
and if this is increasingly and extensively expended upon the lower forms of philanthropic
effort, the higher, spiritual purposes and endeavors must suffer.

The Basle Lutheran Mission of South India has done more industrial work than any other mission
of that land. But the industrial department grew so rapidly and became so absorbing that it
was found necessary to make a separate “mission” of it. It has flourished as a commercial enterprise
and is self-supporting. But the leader of that mission informs me that its blessings are questionable,
in that it tends to demoralize the people and renders little or no aid to their spiritual work.

While I believe that a certain amount of endeavour, by a mission, for the temporal good and
social betterment of its people is legitimate and desirable, extreme care should be taken,
in the present early stage of progress, lest this form of activity become prominent or dominant;
and, above all, lest it, in any way, interfere with the conviction concerning the supreme importance
and prime urgency of the spiritual training and growth of the people. This class of work can
very easily, by changing the people’s ideas of a mission’s aim and purpose, demoralize them.
It can also, with equally fatal facility, transfer the interest of the missionary from the
higher to the lower realm of work, and thus become a curse, rather than a blessing, to him.
If the work of missions is to be broadened the greatest care must be exercised lest this breadth
be secured at the expense of depth of spiritual purpose and power, and height of spiritual
life and experience. I must confess that this new movement, in the present stage of the progress
of missions, brings to me as much fear as it does hope. For, while I see reason for taking
up such work, I know also the demoralizing influences that so naturally and easily follow it.
A mission that allows itself to be secularized, by giving too much emphasis to these social
and civilizing agencies, becomes inevitably paralyzed as a spiritual force in its field; and
woe be to any mission that gains anything at the expense of its spiritual paralysis.

7. MISSION ADMINISTRATION.

The question of administration is an exceedingly important one to every mission. How wisely
are our missions organized for large economy of money and effort and for highest efficiency?
Could not missions unite, for mutual counsel and wisdom, as many officers of our societies
at home now do; could not missions learn more from one another in this most important respect?
The annual expenditure of more than one million dollars on mission work in South India alone
is in itself a large trust which requires great care and breadth of wisdom. Hitherto not much
has been done by the many missions of India to learn from one another the wisest methods of
administration. There is remarkable diversity and even contrast among those missions in the
methods of conducting their work and in the administration of their affairs. This is, in no
small part, due to the different peculiarities of the several nationalities which conduct the
missions; it is also in part due to their denominational affinities. But, by growing familiarity
with one another’s methods and by more appreciative study of the same, much could be learned
by these missions which would tend to increasing uniformity of administrative method, efficiency
of work and abundance of results.

Another question of perennial interest, in this connection, is that of the extent to which
native Christians should be allowed to participate in the administration of the affairs of
a mission. The training of some of the highest members of the native Christian community in
the responsibility of missionary administration is a serious duty of every mission. The day
must come when the whole administration of the Christian work carried on by missions will be
in the hands of the native community itself—when missions, as such, shall have accomplished
their work and shall be disbanded. What is being done by our missions today to make that consummation
possible and desirable at the earliest moment? Most missions maintain that Indians should have
nothing to do with the administration of foreign funds. Is this a wise position to take? Is
it consonant with the best training of the highest native Christians for future control? In
other words, what administrative preparation is being made by the mission for the incoming
of an indigenous, self-governing Church?

It is true that Indian Christians will not, for a long time, be able to render much assistance
to the missions in this line. But if they are to be, at any future time, capable of undertaking
the responsibility of the work they must be trained for it; and this training must be conducted
with patience by the mission. If they are now wanting in independence and poise of character
and breadth of horizon, these can come to them only through an extended training. And it is
the duty of missions to give this training to them.

There is danger that missions cling too tenaciously to their right to rule. Power is sweet
to the missionary no less than to other men.

I am glad to say that progress is made by missions in this matter. Slowly but surely the native
Christian is entering into their counsels and is finding increasing opportunity and responsibility
there.

8. PROBLEMS CONCERNING NEW CONVERTS.

There are many interesting and important questions connected with the reception of new converts
into the Christian fold in India. Some of these have a growing interest to the Cause and have
found an important place in missionary discussion. I shall refer to only a few of them.

(a) Shall polygamous converts be received into the Christian Church?

In Hinduism polygamy (more especially, bigamy) is not uncommon. It is permitted and indeed
fostered by that faith and is legalized by the laws of the country. As our faith makes increasing
inroads upon that religion, numbers, and yet never a large number, of those who have two or
more wives will accept our teaching and, with all earnestness, seek admission into our Christian
communion. What shall we say to such? How shall we meet them and their desire? This question
has, in a few cases, been sent to the societies at home, the missions seeking from them advice
and guidance. From America the instruction has been received against receiving any such into
the Christian Church. This is natural enough from a country which is confronted by the Mormon
question. But the problem has its Eastern bearing which is not understood in the West and which
has led missionary bodies in India almost invariably to decide in favour of receiving such
into the Christian fold.

In the consideration of the problem many things must be kept in mind. None more important than
the claims to a cordial welcome from the Church of any man who, in true faith and Christian
earnestness, seeks admittance. If it be demanded of the man that he put away all but one of
those wives taken in heathenism; then we ask whether it is Christian, or even just, to cast
away one to whom he was solemnly and religiously pledged according to the laws of the land
and with whom he has been linked in love and harmony for years and from whom he has begotten
children? And if he is to put away one or more of his wives, which one shall it be? Shall it
be the first wife? Certainly that would not be Christian. Or shall it be the second wife who
is the mother of his children and whom he probably married at the request of the first, who
was childless, in order that he might raise seed unto himself? It is not easy, on Christian
grounds, to decide such a problem as this; nor is it very Christian to put a ban upon any woman
who, in accordance with their religion and their country’s laws, has formed this sacred alliance
with a man and has lived with him for years. Nor can it be right to brand with illegitimacy
the children born of such a wedlock.

I would not allow such persons, received into the Christian Church, to become officers of the
Church. But I cannot see why there may not be an humble place in the Church of God for such
and their families.

(b) Should the baptism of a person, in any case, immediately follow his confession of Christ?

This question does not pertain to those who live in Christian communities and within the circle
of Christian light and influence. It refers mainly, if not exclusively, to those who accept
Christ under the influence of Christian teaching at heathen festivals and who may live far
away from Christian communities. In North India, some of those who have accepted Christ under
these circumstances have received immediate baptism and have been sent back to their villages
professing Christians. At first sight this seems unwarranted and unwise. Men who have received
and made an open confession of Christ under these circumstances have not likely received a
sufficient knowledge of our faith, or attained an adequate familiarity with its truths; nor
have they been grounded in its principles and life, sufficiently to warrant us in the hope
and assurance that they will continue this life in their heathen homes and do honour to our
cause and the name of Christ which they have professed. And yet who are we to decide adversely
upon the application of such a man who may find, or think he finds, in that public occasion
the only opportunity of making an open confession of Christ? And what right have we to conclude
that he will not stand firm to his pledge and promise if we are convinced that it is made in
all sincerity and earnestness, and if we are convinced that the man has really accepted Christ
as his Saviour? Or, more properly, what ground have we to believe that the Holy Spirit cannot
carry on to perfection the work thus begun by Him in the heart of such a man? And was not this
method of immediate baptism that of the Apostolic Church, even though many thus baptized subsequently
denied their new faith?

There are, doubtless, cases of this kind where baptism cannot be refused by the minister of
God—where it is even imperative and may prove a blessing to the heathen audience as well as
to the new convert. And yet, the ordinary method of delay and careful scrutiny and training
should still be adhered to as a normal method of the Church in heathen lands. It is the safest
way to lead to a healthy and a strong Church.

(c) Another question frequently asked is that concerning secret baptism.

Shall a missionary, at any time and under any circumstances, secretly baptize such as are anxious
to make confession of Christ, but are debarred by family opposition, or by similar causes,
from public baptism? This problem frequently arises in connection with work for heathen women.
Under the influence of the work of a Bible woman, or a lady missionary, a woman may abjure
her faith, accept Christ as her Saviour and yearn for baptism. But to be baptized publicly
and to confess Christ before her people openly would inevitably result in her being driven
from home, separated from her children and people, and robbed of all opportunity to influence
them in behalf of her newly found faith. Moreover, by this public confession she is deprived
of all family support and becomes a helpless dependent upon the mission for her daily bread.
The question rises whether such a woman should be quietly baptized and thus left to pursue
her way in her own home and with her family as a pledged, but secret, follower of the Lord.
There is much to be said in favour of, as there is against, such a baptism. Many contend that
such an acceptance of Christ would be unworthy and would be robbed of its saving power. But
such are not conversant with Hindu life and some of its terrible conditions. Some would maintain,
perhaps with more wisdom, that it would be better not to baptize such, but to encourage them
to believe that they are accepted of Christ and to treat them in every way as Christ’s own
disciples.

Another problem in this connection is as to the right or wisdom of an unordained lady missionary
to administer this initiatory rite to such women converts. This question, of course, will be
largely decided in accordance with the ecclesiastical connection of those who consider it.
There is a growing number of persons who believe that it would be well that ladies be authorized
to administer this rite under such circumstances.

9. Another problem is connected with the revival of thought among the people of India whom
we seek to bring to Christ.

This revival is really the result of western influence—largely the product of Christian teaching
and activity in that land. In its last analysis it is therefore not to be deplored, but rather
to be welcomed. At the same time this new awakening seems to be, for the present, connected
with a reactionary and a militant spirit. It speaks in the interest of a new nationalism and
a false patriotism which extols everything Eastern simply because it is Oriental. Its aggressiveness
is manifest even in America. We are becoming familiar, in this country, with the yellow-robed
Hindu monk who has probably been trained in a Christian mission college and who talks Hinduism
with a strong Christian accent. Though he has violated a peremptory command of his ancestral
faith in crossing the seas; and though, of necessity, he daily tramples in this land the whole
decalogue of Hindu life and ritual, he feels competent to champion Hindu philosophy here! And
he seems to find a coterie of admirers and quasi disciples in this land of light and privilege!
Recently an old classmate of mine informed me, with all solemnity, that Eastern thought is
now invading the West; and that he himself had become a theosophist! I have, since hearing
this statement, travelled considerably over this country and confess that his statement does
not seem so absurd as at first I thought. For, I have seen the recent phenomenal spread of
Christian Science and of other vagaries with which we are too familiar in this land. What is
Christian Science but the subtle, evasive idealism of India unequally yoked to a form of Christian
truth and ritual. What is theosophy, but the stupefying philosophy and the benumbing metaphysics
of the East, clothed in its own garb of Oriental mysticism and senseless, spurious occultism.
It is a sad reflection upon our Western life that so many people who fail to find rest in the
divinely inspiring teachings of Christ, sink into the depths of a credulity which will accept
the inanities of Madame Blavatsky and the wild assumptions of Mrs. Eddy. Let these people go
out to India and live there for years to see how Hindu thought and teachings have, for three
millenniums, worked out their legitimate results in the life of the teeming millions of that
land. Let them observe the debasing immorality, the hollow ceremonialism, the all-pervasive
ignorance and superstition which rest, like a mighty pall, upon that people and which make
life mean and render noble manhood impossible. The situation in India reminds one of the legendary
house built upon the banks of Newfoundland. The foundation was completed when a dense fog swept
over the place and rested upon all. After the superstructure was built and finished the fog
lifted and it was found, alas, that the building was erected some two hundred yards away from
the foundation, and rested upon nothing! Whatever one may say about Hindu thought and philosophy
as a basis of conduct, that people have been living for many centuries in the dense fog of
ignorance, superstition and ceremonialism; and their life has been unworthy and debased because
it rested upon nothing.

But there is another form of this awakened Eastern thought which invites our attention and
which concerns the missionary work not a little. It appears there in a reactionary form among
men of culture and leads many of them to turn away in hearty disapproval from our faith. They
are wonderfully drawn towards Christ, our Lord. His praises are in their mouths, and they eagerly
study his example and life. They claim him as one of the East and, therefore, as one of themselves.
But these same men will have none of Christianity, because it is, as they say, of the West,
Western. One of their number recently wrote an article under the following caption:—“Why do
We Hindus Accept Christ and Reject Christianity?” He claims that they reject our faith because
it is “not Christianity but Churchianity”; that is, it savours of the Western Church more than
it does of Christ. There is a great deal that is false and foolish in this contention; and
yet it has an element of truth in it. We, of the West, have not realized, perhaps we never
can fully realize, the great width of the gulf which, in thought and life, separates the Occident
from the Orient. Hence we have in part failed in the duty of adapting our faith, in thought
and ritual, to the taste and inherited bias of that people. We forget that they and we usually
approach things temporal and spiritual from opposite sides. They are deeply mystical and poetic,
while we are obtrusively practical and meanly prosaic. Thus the Western colouring and emphasis
which is given to our faith in that land can neither be appreciated nor approved by the educated
Hindu. Even native Christians are bemoaning this fact. I shall never forget the eloquent appeal
which the Hon. Kali Churn Banerjee, a leading native Christian in that land, made before the
Bombay Missionary Conference, begging the missionaries to cease emphasizing, as he said, “adjectival”
Christianity and to dwell more upon “substantive” Christianity before the people of India.
It is a sad fact that we carry there our Western shibboleths, our antiquated controversies,
and our sectional jealousies. Most of these are not only unintelligible in India; they weary
the people and largely bury the essentials of our faith from public gaze and appreciation.

The question returns to us with a new emphasis today,—How much of our Western Christianity
can we eliminate and how much must we retain in order to present to that people the gospel
in its simplicity and saving power? How much of our modern Christianity is the product of Western
thought, interpretation and life, and how much is of the very essence of Christ’s message?
We have yet much to learn and are to be overtaken by many surprises in this matter, I believe.
God forbid that we should rob our message of one tittle of its essential truth. But may He
enable us to discriminate more and more, and lead us to cease encumbering our gospel to the
East with such unessential thought and ritual as are suited to us but not to them.

I doubt whether we of the West can accomplish this—it can be fully done only when the Christian
Church in India shall have become indigenous and strong, and, when freed from Western influence
and leadership, it shall do its own thinking and shape its own ritual and ceremonial on Eastern
lines. Then indeed shall we behold that welcome and mighty movement which will draw completely
the culture of India into the Christian Church. Then also, and not until then, shall we begin
to see the Indian Church contributing her share to the Christian thought and life of the world.
We, of the proud West, are prone to think that our type of life is all-embracing and that our
religious thought is all-satisfying. Nothing can be more fallacious or more injurious than
such a conceit. The East is the full complement of the West. In life and thought we are only
an hemisphere, and we need the East to fill up our full-orbed beauty. The mystic piety of India
will correct our too practical, mundane view of things. The quiet, passive virtues which find
their perfect realization in that land we must learn from them to accentuate in addition to
the more aggressive and positive virtues of the West. All this is to take place in the no distant
future. The Kingdom of Christ in the East is to reach out its hand to the West and both, in
mutual helpfulness, will coöperate in bringing this whole world to Christ. Then shall we see
a universal kingdom and the beginning of the fulfillment of the blessed vision in which “the
kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ, and He shall
reign forever and ever.” God hasten the day.

                                Chapter X.

MISSIONARY RESULTS.

We are occasionally compelled to read and to hear detailed and emphatic statements about “the
failure of missions.” An increasing number of our countrymen spend their vacation days in hurried
trips through mission fields. They are so impressed by glimpses of the strange life and institutions
of the Orient that they have neither time nor inclination to study and appreciate the missionary
work and organization which everywhere invites their attention. They return home absolutely
ignorant of the work whose power, prevalence and progress they might easily have learned on
their travels, and they are wont to hide that ignorance behind the emphatic assurance that
“there was nothing to be seen” of missions; and they soon convince themselves, and not a few
others, that what they did not see was not worth seeing or was, perchance, non-existent. I
have long lived on one of the great lines of travel in India and have sorrowed over the fact
that hardly one in ten of our travelling countrymen (and many of them members of our home churches
too) turn aside for a moment from gazing upon Hindu temples to study the important work which
our mission is carrying forward in that city and district.

Even the friends of missions should learn what constitutes missionary success.

In South India there is found a mission which counts its converts only by the hundreds. It
is known in Christian lands only through the severe criticisms which have been heaped upon
it by some good Christian men because it is an educational mission.

And yet I sincerely believe that that abused mission is doing a work not inferior to that of
any other mission in India for the permanent growth and highest achievement of the Kingdom
of God in that land. Its leavening influence upon Hindu thought and institutions is hardly
surpassed by that of any other mission. In the wonderful turning of the educated classes of
India towards Christ, and the acceptance of him as their Ideal of life, that mission has a
position of power. Many of the native Christians of greatest influence, culture and character
in South India trace their conversion or highest efficiency to the work and influence of that
educational mission. The best educated pastor in the Madura district came from and was trained
by that mission; as also its highest and best Christian teachers received their final course
of training and discipline there.

That mission is largely ignored and even despised by the too common statistical reckoning of
results and success. And yet the illustrious name of Dr. Miller, the leader of that mission,
will be cherished in India and in the world a century hence as a chief among those who were
instrumental in bringing that great people to Christ.

The mighty and unparalleled revolution which is going on in India at present, as a result of
missionary work, is not to be tabulated in our statistical reports. The deepest currents of
those great moral and spiritual forces of the India of today are not found within the realm
of figures. They defy tabulation; and yet they bring to the keen Christian observer in that
land more encouragement, because they have more significance, than all the facts and figures
usually found within the covers of an ordinary mission report.

A great deal of the discouragement and pessimism about missions today is born of this statistical
craze.

Let us therefore take a broad view of the work of our missions and study some of the results
achieved—results which are almost entirely the harvest of the labours of the last century.

These results are threefold.

1. PRESENT MISSIONARY APPLIANCES.

(a) Protestant missions in India have created a plant and have developed appliances which are
not only an assurance and a prolific source of encouragement for the future; they are also
monuments of the industry and wisdom of those who have passed on, and definite signs of God’s
guidance of, and blessing to, the work.

In the first place, consider the buildings and other property erected and owned by the missionary
societies and utilized for the maintenance and furtherance of their work in that land.

Few people realize the enormous store of wealth which is thus treasured in this elaborate mission
plant. Nor can they appreciate the equivalent of this in terms of moral efficiency and spiritual
power in the regeneration of India.

The thousands of acres of land and the many thousands of substantial edifices erected and dedicated
to the cause of Christ in connection with these missions represent an investment of at least
ten million dollars; and this money not only represents the generosity of Christians in the
West, it also includes the self-denying offerings of Indian Christians, who from their poverty
have given liberally to build up the cause which is dear to their hearts.

Mission educational institutions are housed in a legion of substantial and beautiful buildings
ranging, from the massive imposing structures of the Madras Christian College, downward; churches
there are of all sizes and architectural design, from the magnificent and beautiful stone edifice
which accommodates its thousands and which was erected by the Church Missionary Society in
Megnanapuram, Tinnevelly, down to the unpretentious prayer-house of a small village congregation.
A host of suitable buildings for hospitals, presses and publishing houses, residences for missionaries
and native agents, school dormitories, gymnasia and lecture halls; Y. M. C. A. and other societies’
buildings—all these represent that power for service, incarnate in brick and mortar, which
is invaluable and even indispensable to the great missionary enterprise in that land.

(b) Nor must we overlook or fail to estimate adequately the results achieved in the form of
a Christian literature. Though our Protestant missions have not cultivated, as extensively
as they should, the press and the publishing house as a missionary agency, they have not been
insensible to their power and have utilized extensively the printed page.

In the first place a translated and a well-circulated Bible has been the aim and pride of our
missions from the beginning. The humblest native of that land can find, in his own vernacular,
the Word of God, and read for himself the message of God in Christ Jesus to his sin-burdened
soul. Who can realize the work involved in all this, or the achievement which it represents?

Then the Christian hymnology of India is already a rapidly growing power. Every important vernacular
has one or more Protestant Christian hymn books, which reveal to what a large extent our faith
has inspired and made vocal the praises of Zion in that land. Nearly all of these Christian
hymns in South India and many in North India are the compositions of native Christians and
manifest considerable poetic power and high sentiment. Though many of them are worthy of translation,
only two have thus far found place in our American hymn books. One is a Tamil hymn composed
by Yesuthasan, catechist, and translated as below by Rev. E. Webb,—

1. Whither with this crushing load Over Salem’s dismal road, All thy body suffering so, O,
my God where dost thou go?

CHORUS:—

Whither Jesus goest thou, Son of God what doest thou, On this City’s dolorous way, With that
cross, O, Sufferer say?

2. Tell me fainting, dying Lord, Dost thou of Thine own accord Bear that cross, or did thy
foes ’Gainst thy will, that load impose.—CHO.

3. Patient Sufferer how can I See thee faint and fall and die, Pressed and peeled and crushed
and ground By that cross upon thee bound?—CHO.

4. Weary arm and staggering limb, Visage marred, eyes growing dim, Tongue all parched, faint
at heart, Bruised and sore in every part!—CHO.

5. Dost thou up to Calvary go, On that cross in shame and woe, Malefactors either side To be
nailed and crucified?—CHO.

6. Is it demon thrones to shake, Death to kill, sin’s power to break, All our ills to put away,
Life to give and endless day?—CHO.

Besides this there is an ever-growing mass of Christian literature in all the vernaculars used
by our missions; and this is becoming increasingly available as a power for the uplifting of
the people who are, in growing numbers, learning to read. Beyond almost every other appliance
for the Christianization of that people there stand high in usefulness and pervasive influence
these books, tracts and magazines of the missions; and the aid which they furnish to all Christian
workers in that land is beyond computation. Missionaries may go and come, and mission policy
may change, but this Christian literature will quietly and mightily work out its own benign
results throughout the land, enlightening the people and appealing to the best that is in them.

(c) In like manner the missionary educational institutions, which cover the whole land as a
great network, are a noble product of missionary ideals and efforts in the land. They are in
themselves an achievement which not only has cost millions of rupees for its creation and maintenance,
but is also the product of some of the best thought and highest wisdom of many choice spirits
during the last century. These schools constantly furnish to the Christian Church in India,
for intellectual upbuilding, for moral guidance and for spiritual regeneration, nearly a half
million of the brightest youths of the land. These institutions are the product of a century
of endeavour; and it can be truly said that without them the Protestant mission of India would
be shorn of much of their power and more of their promise.

In the present organized activity of missions there stands nothing in higher esteem than these
institutions for what they have done in the life both of non-Christians and of Christians alike.

(d) In connection with missionary activity in that land one of the most encouraging, as it
is also the most monumental, of results, is the large army of well-educated and thoroughly
equipped men and women who have been taken from among the people and have been trained and
placed as their leaders and guides.

Perhaps 20,000 such (there are 10,550 in South India alone) are at present giving all their
time and strength to the spiritual training of the Christian community, to preaching to non-Christians
and to the instruction of the young in the schools.

India is to be brought to Christ and his religion, not through the efforts of the foreigner,
so much as through the life and activity of men and women of the soil. They are to be the essential
factor in the future prevalence and in the character of our faith in India. Therefore it stirs
one to deepest emotion to behold this mighty army of native workers, who are praying and working
daily in that land for the conversion of their own people and for the upbuilding of the Christian
community in all that is characteristic of our faith. As I have been permitted, for years,
to train and to send forth into that great harvest field young men to preach the gospel of
Christ and to guide the churches and congregations into spiritual truth and life, I have felt
that it was the highest and best opportunity that could be granted to any missionary worker
in that land. This work of training an adequate spiritual agency is occupying the serious thought
of all missions. There are 110 theological seminaries and normal training schools in the country;
in these, 4,305 students, of both sexes, are undergoing training.

Many of the agents now employed are men and women qualified to clearly expound the truths of
our faith to believers and unbelievers. They are well fortified against attack as rational
defenders of Christianity and are prepared to remove doubts which may arise in the minds of
sincere inquirers and wavering believers. Not all of them are such as we could wish in intellectual
equipment or in strength of character. But the poorest of them are gradually being replaced
by better ones; and the intellectual, moral and spiritual tone of the whole force is constantly
improving. The ordained native clergy are a body of men who are rapidly growing in efficiency
and power. There are 406 of them in South India alone—nearly as many as there are ordained
missionaries in the same area.

A comparison, in South India, between this force of 406 native pastors and the 585 native priests
of the Romish Church shows how well, relatively, the Protestant Church of South India is supplied;
there being one native pastor to every 1,500 of the Protestant community, while the Romish
priests are only one to every 2,000 of their community.

Some of these pastors are university graduates, and all are men of good professional training.
They are faithful workers and are increasingly worthy, and enjoy the confidence, of their missionary
associates. Among the native agents of our Protestant missions in South India alone there are
about 100 university graduates, 200 First in Arts (the degree granted after two years of college
work) and 600 university matriculates. This thorough utilization of a strong, cultured, native
agency is one of the most striking results of the last century’s work in that land. And it
is the more remarkable in the case of the women, since a generation ago hardly any of the weaker
sex were in mission employ, while today the missions of South India alone employ 3,000 of them.
It is practically the creation of a mighty and most faithful and devoted agency in one generation.

What may we not expect from this great army of native brethren and sisters, as they shall continue
to grow in numbers and in general equipment, and as they shall be filled with the Spirit of
God and be fully used by our Lord in the redemption of their own people!

2. THE NATIVE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.

Recent statistics give the total number of Christians in British India as 2,923,349. This is
a growth of about 640,000 in ten years, four times more than the rate of growth of the whole
population. And yet there are people who tell us that the kingdom of our Lord is not coming
in that land!

131,210     125,558

Of the above number of Christians 2,664,359 are natives of India. This is an increase of over
630,000, or about thirty-one per cent, of Indian Christians during the last decade. And during
this time the general population of India has increased only about two and one-half per cent.!
Analyzing this aggregate of all Christians we find that 970,000 of them are native Protestant
Christians. This represents an advance of sixty-four per cent, during the last ten years in
that community; while the Romish and Syrian native Christian communities have gained hardly
three per cent, in the same time. Thus it will be seen that the rapid progress of our faith
in that land of the East depends almost entirely upon the remarkable advance of Protestantism
among the people of India. This is certainly a result most encouraging to Protestant Christian
workers in that land. That this decade’s growth is not abnormal is attested by the fact that
the native Protestant Christians of India are more than ten times what they were fifty years ago.

In view of the fact that the whole Christian community of India is only one per cent, of the
total population, one may be inclined to feel discouraged. And yet if the relative growth of
the whole population and, say, of the Protestant Christian community for the last decade be
maintained for one hundred and thirty years more, the whole population will be found Christian
of the Protestant type.

These figures indicate the magnificent development of our work in that land. And when we remember
the splendid equipment and wonderful modern appliances of the missionary organizations of today
we can easily believe that, even within another century, Christianity will become the prevailing
faith of India.

A large number, in our Christian community, has been gathered through mass movements, where
certain castes and classes have, in large bodies, sought the blessings of our faith. In Tinnevelly,
for instance, the Shanar caste was early influenced by Christian workers; and, as they are
a very clannish community, many thousands of them have embraced the Christian faith and have
been wonderfully transformed and elevated through their contact with it.

One of the most marvellous manifestations of the power of the Gospel is presented today in
that district by this people, who, under missionary influence and Christian training, have
risen from great depths of ignorance and social degradation until they stand among the highest
of that land in intelligence and in the spirit of progress. Most of the Christians of Tinnevelly
belong to this once despised class and are, in many respects, full of vigour and enterprise.

In the famous Telegu Baptist Mission we find a similar movement. That American Mission laboured
for twenty-five years without much encouragement. After those years the outcastes of the community
began to appreciate the advantages of our faith and to apply for admission into its congregations.
It gathered them in by thousands until it has become by far the largest mission in the country.
It represents nearly one quarter of the whole Protestant Christian community of India.

During the last few years a similar movement has overtaken the American Methodist, and other
missions in North India. Many thousands of the depressed classes, within its area, have sought
a refuge from their ills and a Saviour for their souls in the Christian fold; so that it taxes
all the energies and resources of the mission to keep pace with the movement and to instruct
adequately, in Christian truth, these ignorant masses who flock unto it. Bishop Thoburn says
that more than 100,000 of this class are now waiting to be received into their community; but
that their mission has not the men or means to instruct them.

In other missions, also, reports are being received of similar movements now going forward
on a smaller scale. Some missionaries of these fields have written to me stating that the only
limit to the growth and development of their missions is that of men and money wherewith to
instruct and properly direct the people who come seeking for light and help.(13)

In the great majority of missions, however, growth has been general and normal; people have
come as individuals and as families, separating themselves, after much thought and prayer,
from those who are dearest to them upon earth, and passing through a sea of tribulation and
persecution into the Christian life.

It has been claimed by Hindus, and by some others, that Hinduism is a tolerant faith—that it
does not resort to persecution. In one respect this is true. As we have before seen, it will
permit its members to hold any doctrine and to accept any teaching that they please. It has
no punishment nor even a voice of disapprobation to its member who is a rationalist, an atheist,
or a Christian so far as acceptance of such belief or non-belief is concerned. And, so far
as conduct is concerned, a man may be a libertine, a robber or a murderer, and yet maintain
his religious status. But when it comes to the violation of caste rules it is very different.
Hinduism will tolerate anything but caste insubordination. So that when a man, in becoming
a Christian, severs his connection with his caste and becomes, socially, an alien to his people,
then Hinduism steps in and brings to bear upon him all the bitter penalties of caste infliction,
and persecutes him in a thousand social ways such as make life a burden unto him. The engine
of caste is the most complete and mighty instrument of religious persecution the world has
known, as many thousands of our native Christians have learned to their bitter cost.

When a man decides to become a Christian there is very little opposition to this purpose among
his people so long as his decision involves only his belief, conviction and private devotion
and prayer. But when it leads him to a public confession of Christ and to baptism, which is
regarded as his renunciation of caste rules, affinities and obligations, then all the spite
of caste tyranny is showered upon him. He is boycotted thoroughly. None of his caste people,
not even his own Hindu family, will eat with him. The family and caste washerman is no longer
permitted to serve him; their barber will not shave him, and the blacksmith, carpenter, mason
and other village servants decline to render him their wonted service. So that he is absolutely
helpless. It requires a very strong man to face all this kind of annoyance and deprivation,
and to stand firm in the new life upon which he has entered and continue loyal to the new faith
which he has embraced.

It must be admitted that such rigours of persecution are not carried out in all cases at present.
Though this is the spirit and method of caste, yet the influence of home ties and family affection
and the social position and influence of a new convert may be such as to mitigate this public
opposition to his Christian decision. But the engine of persecution is there, always ready for use.

The question has often been asked as to the motives which animated those of our Christian community
who denied their ancestral faith in order to become Christians. In this land many have an idea,
in some cases expressed but in many unexpressed, that most of the Christian converts in India
are what are denominated “rice Christians.” This charge against the adherents of our faith
in that land is as unworthy as it is untrue. That some embrace our religion and take upon them
the name of Christ from unworthy motives we know—perhaps this is a thing not confined to India.
But it has always been a surprise to me, not that so many, but that so few, join our missions
from worldly or unworthy motives. For they soon learn that the missionary of their district
is a friend of the poor and the oppressed; and they are constantly suffering from the injustice
and the rapacity of Brahmans and of other members of their own faith who are above them. Outside
of slavery there are few people who are subject to grosser injustice at the hand of men of
wealth and of power than are the poor, down-trodden people of India.

Most of them are also groaning in the deepest pit of poverty. Poverty is a relative term. As
compared with India, America knows absolutely no poverty. The poverty of India is crushing,
over-whelming. When we remember that according to government statistics, the average income
of a man for the support of his family in India is less than $1.50 a month we get a glimpse
of what abject poverty means.

And when we further remember that, during many months and seasons of his life, even this is
partly denied him, owing to frequent droughts and other unpreventable evils, we know in part
how an unsatisfied craving, and pinching distress overwhelm a large proportion of that population.
Government statistics show that one-fifth of the population are in a chronic state of hunger.

And yet I heartily bear testimony that comparatively few of our people have become Christians
in order that they might receive physical and temporal blessings. We dare not say that this
motive does not exist; but we are confident that in three-fourths of our converts it is not
the prevailing or the dominant motive. There is a soul-hungering and a heart-thirsting in India
such as are not in any way satisfied by their ancestral faith. And Christianity appeals to
the people increasingly as a soul-satisfier and as a power of God unto salvation; and they
more and more realize this fact and are impelled more by that motive than by any other in transferring
their allegiance from Krishna to Christ.

And even when some do come with prevailingly low and sordid motives and seek to be enrolled
as members of the Christian community, we dare not discourage or deny them; because we hope
soon, after they have united with our community and have placed themselves under Christian
instruction, to impart to them loftier conceptions of life and of truth. And even should we
fail to reform them and to give them worthy views of our religion and of their relationship
to it, we entertain the hope that their children will become worthy and genuine Christians.
Many of the best and most honoured members of our community, today, are the children and grandchildren
of very unsatisfactory Christians of the past.

I might say here that missionaries are being frightened less and less by the charges so frequently
made, by those who know the situation least, concerning the unworthy motives of those who become
Christians. Indeed, to be frank, the question of motives is, in my opinion, one of very little
consequence, save as it may involve down-right hypocrisy or gross deception.

Ordinarily we do not expect, from a people who have been brought up in so selfish and so debasing
and sordid an atmosphere as that of the common Hindu of today, a highly spiritual, or a purely
ethical motive in becoming Christians. If such be the prevailing motive, or even if we are
convinced that it is not absent, we are satisfied. Nor can there be anything wrong if a man
in India seeks alliance with Christianity in order to better his earthly circumstances. This
may mean a purpose to secure an education and the blessings of civilization and culture for
his children; or it may reveal a desire for relief from injustice, or protection from gross
tyranny; it may signify merely a vague hope that, by becoming a Christian, the general circumstances
both of himself and family will be improved. There is nothing intrinsically evil in any of
these ambitions nor in seeking Christian affiliation largely with a view to obtaining these,
provided always that there is also a conviction of the moral and spiritual excellence of our
faith and of its ability to satisfy the soul’s need. And this we may generally assume in a
man who voluntarily severs his connection with the faith of his ancestors, and from a religion
which was a part of his own deepest life.

Nor should the deep ignorance of many of those who become Christians lead us hastily to conclude
that, because they know so little about our faith, they therefore are unable to appreciate
or enjoy any of its spiritual blessings. I have often been surprised to see how many very ignorant
Christians, and those who greatly try our patience at times, both by their stupidity and their
crooked lives, nevertheless often reveal beautiful touches of a genuine faith and of a most
direct and simple trust; and they stand nobly firm under the most trying and worrying persecution
which Hinduism knows too well how to inflict upon those who desert and deny it.

It has often been charged, with a view to discredit missionary effort in India, that the converts
gathered into the Christian fold have been from the lowest social stratum, and not from the
higher and ruling classes of society. Even if this charge were entirely true, I can see in
it nothing reflecting upon the success of our cause in that land.

It has, indeed, in all ages and lands, been the normal process of Christian conquest, to gather
in the lower classes first. It is not by filtering downward but by leavening upward that Christianity
has been wont to enter and to transform nations. As this was the initial method in apostolic
days, so has it continued through all the history of the Church. It has been by the weak and
despised things of the world that our Lord has brought to nought and then won the mighty. It
is so in India. Perhaps three-fourths of the native Christians of that land are from the non-Aryan
community—from the aboriginal classes over whom the sway of Hinduism is less complete than
it is over the Aryan races. This is doubtless one reason why two-thirds of all the Christians
of India are found in Southern India—among the Dravidians, who, as we have seen, are more the
children of Demonolatry than they are of Brahmanism. And yet, let it not be supposed that the
Turanians of the South are far inferior to the Aryans of the North; or that the salvation of
the so-called “aborigines” of India, of whom there are more than sixty millions, is unworthy
of our highest ambition.

Neither let it be thought that Christianity has not made glorious inroad upon the middle classes
and even upon the highest class in that land—the Brahmans. It is true that, thus far, not very
many of that high and haughty caste have openly professed Christ. It is equally true, however,
that some of the best members of our Christian community are converted Brahmans. The Indian
Christian community is proud of such men as the Hon. Kali Churn Bannerjee, Dr. K. M. Bannerjee,
Rev. K. C. Chatterjee, Rae Maya Das and the Hon. N. Subramanien, not because they were Brahmans,
but because they have consecrated to the Lord all their distinguished ability, and because
they excel in their possession of Christian graces.

These names, and many others like them, reveal the growing power that our faith is wielding
over men of position in that land. At the coronation of King Edward, in London, twenty representatives
of the Indian Christian Church were present. Of these, six are ruling princes; perhaps the
most distinguished of them is Sir Harnam Singh Ahluwalia, K. C. I. E. He is a man of culture—“a
true representative of educated India.”

He was entrusted by the Indian Christians to convey their address to the king upon the occasion
of his coronation. Sir Harnam Singh’s usefulness and success largely depend upon the support,
which he receives, in all good things, from his wife, Lady Singh, who is the daughter of Rev.
Golak Nath.

The devout Henry Martyn, nearly a century ago, with mingled discouragement and yearning, declared
that to see one Hindu a real believer in Jesus would be something more nearly approaching the
resurrection of a dead body than anything he had yet seen. The illustrious Jesuit missionary,
the Abbe Du Bois, mourned that, even after a long period of faithful work, he believed he had
seen no genuine convert to Christianity in that land. How would those two great friends of
India rejoice today were they to see the glorious harvest which Christianity has been permitted
to gather during the last century from that great people! And among the best of them are to
be seen not a few representatives of the haughty Brahman caste and also members of the crushed
and despised outcaste Pariah community.

It is well to remember that it has been the ambition of missionaries in India, not so much
to gather in numerous accessions from the social and intellectual aristocracy of the land,
as to create out of the Indian Christian community, however degraded may have been its origin,
an aristocracy of character and of true culture. And in this they have achieved remarkable
success. For the native Christian community is being most rapidly transformed in these respects.
Remember, please, the condition, previous to their embracing our faith, of those outcaste people
who now constitute three-fourths of the Christian community. They were not only socially ostracized,
and therefore wanting in all traits of manly assertion, of independence and of self-respect.
They were also in deepest ignorance. Not five per cent, of them could either read or write.
Moreover they were under serious religious disability. Though nominal Hindus, they had no right
to enter purely Hindu temples nor to approach in worship any strictly Hindu deity. The most
sacred of Hindu religious books were denied them, and the most cherished of Hindu rites and
ceremonies they were deemed totally unfit to observe.

All that they could claim was permission to appease the demons of their ancestral worship.
I have seen these outcastes, who, while absorbed into Hinduism, nevertheless live constantly
under its ban. They erect fine halls and shrines in Brahmanical temples, but are not permitted
to enter them after the day of their dedication to Hindu worship. Hinduism has never declined
any pecuniary offerings from these despised ones; and yet it has never deemed it its province
or duty to impart its religious blessings to them. It has denied to them instruction, comfort
and salvation. Is it a wonder that most of the people were almost on a level with brutes so
far as thoughts of the highest interests of the soul are concerned? These are the people whom
Christianity has delighted to rescue from their thralldom and to build up in religious thought,
ambition and spiritual blessings.

It has applied itself to the task of raising them from their low estate. It has erected buildings
for their instruction. In most cases its prayer-houses have been daily used as schoolhouses
where the young have been instructed; so that today this community stands distinguished among
the other communities in the land for its intelligence.

For example, the total number of Christian youth in mission schools in South India is 62,000—two-thirds
of them being boys and one-third girls, which represents a percentage to the total of school-going-age
of 68.7 for boys and 33.7 for girls; and this while, in the general community, only twelve
per cent, of those who are of an age to be at school are attending school. Among the Brahmans
only is literacy more common than among Indian Christians. And even that caste, which has for
thirty centuries represented the cultured aristocracy of India, must look to its laurels; for,
though their males are preëminent in culture, the females are as illiterate as any class in
India, only six in 1,000 being able to read. In the Christian community, on the other hand,
the women are not far behind the men in the race for culture. It is therefore not difficult
to prophesy that the day is not far off when the Indian Christians, among whom both sexes find
equal opportunity and inducement to study in the schools, will outstrip the Brahmans and stand
preëminent as the educated and cultured class of India.

This is as true in the higher as in the lower grades of education. There are today living 418
native Christian graduates of the Madras University. Last year twenty-seven of these Christian
youth received the B. A. degree in that Presidency alone, and the only three Indian ladies
who have seized the difficult and much coveted prize of Master of Arts from that University
are Christians. These facts are significant and reveal the marvellous progress made by this
once despised community.

As to the character of these Christians the testimony of Sir Alexander Mackensie, a distinguished
Anglo Indian statesman of large experience, may be of interest:—“The advance made (in missions)
during my time,” he says, “have been substantial and encouraging, and it is my firm belief
that the day-spring of still better things is very close at hand, while the simple faith and
godly lives of many native Christians, might put all, or most of us certainly, to the blush.”

It may be well to add emphasis here to the position of woman in the native Christian community
as a direct result of mission endeavour in that land.

The new womanhood of the infant native Christian community has begun to impress itself upon
the land. There are nearly five hundred thousand women and girls connected with the Protestant
missions of that country today. They are being trained for, and introduced to, new spheres
and opportunities such as the women of India never dreamed of before. Thousands of them are
engaged as teachers and as Bible women. Some practice medicine; others adorn and cheer the
homes, beautify the lives and strengthen the work of pastors and preachers, of teachers, doctors
and other professional men. They grow into the full bloom of womanhood before they leave their
school training; and they go forth well equipped intellectually, morally and spiritually for
the manifold duties of life.

The last few years have not only helped the Christian women of the land, as a class, they have
also brought into distinction many of them who are worthy to stand among the eminent women
of the age and world.

The first of these, both on account of the remarkable career which she has led and of the noble
work which she is performing, is the well-known Pundita Ramabai. Herself a Brahman widow, who
lost her father in the tender years of childhood and who subsequently entered into the joys
and blessed power of a Christian life, she dedicated herself to the work of redeeming her unfortunate
Hindu sisters from their sad lot. To this noble work of philanthropy and of heroic Christian
service she has given herself absolutely; and through distinguished administrative skill and
a triumphant faith she has achieved marvellous success. Beside her well-known institution for
child-widows at Poonah—the Sharada Sadan, which the writer visited and greatly admired—the
recent famine inspired her to a new effort to save the waifs and orphans of that region. So
that, today, she has under her care more than two thousand of the unfortunate ones of her own
sex whom she is not only protecting and wisely training for worthy positions in life, but is
also bringing forward into the joys of a true Christian life. Few women, in any land, have
found a more useful, or more honourable, career than this noble woman of the East. She combines,
in a rare degree, large capacity for work, the highest sanity in her methods and the deepest
love for those whom she has given her life to bless.

The Sorabjis, also of Western India, have achieved distinction beyond most native Christian
families. Mr. Sorabji was one of the few Parsees who have embraced Christianity. One of the
daughters of the family, the widow of an Englishman, lives in London and has delighted the
Queen by her exquisite rendering of Persian songs. One sister is an artist, whose paintings
are exhibited in Paris and London. One is a surgeon of distinction. It was another daughter
of this family who was the only representative of her sex from the Orient at the Parliament
of Religions in Chicago. The most distinguished of these seven sisters is Cornelia Sorabji,
the barrister. Her graduating paper on “Roman Law,” at Oxford, was classed among the best papers
produced by the pupils of that famous institution. She is the first lady barrister of India,
and is not only a powerful advocate, but also a brilliant writer, as her book and her articles
on the woman question in “The Nineteenth Century” amply testify.

Toru Dutt, of Calcutta, one of the brilliant young stars of India, was versed in French, German
and English. At twenty-one she published “A Sheaf Gleaned in French Fields.” It is a skillful
and able English translation of the works of famous French authors. She and her sister, Aru,
were remarkably talented. It is sad that she, who was so full of intellectual brightness and
so beautiful in Christian life, should have been taken away by death in the bloom of life.

Miss Goreh is the only Indian Christian who has thus far added to our popular English hymnology.
Her beautiful hymn:

“In the secret of His presence how my soul delights to hide; Oh, how precious are the moments
which I spend at Jesus’ side. Earthly cares can never reach me, neither trials bring me low;
For when Satan comes to tempt me to the Secret Place I go,”—

has been a blessing to many in this land of ours.

Mrs. Sattianathan of Madras (the wife of a distinguished Indian Christian) was another bright
young woman who showed marked evidence of talent as an English writer. Her books, descriptive
of the life both of Hindu and of Indian Christian women, have had deservedly large popularity.
They created in many of her friends a hope for even greater results from her. But, alas, these
hopes were soon shattered by her sad and premature death.

The second Mrs. Sattianathan, herself an M. A. of the Madras University, has entered upon a
brilliant career as a writer, and has established the first English monthly magazine for her
Indian sisters—a magazine which is full of attractiveness and promise.

These ladies are only a few of those who illustrate the ability, devotion, beauty and promise
of the women of India. Such are preëminently the hope of that country.

It was while looking upon one of these Indian Christian ladies that the late Benjamin Harrison,
Ex-President of the United States, remarked that if he had spent a million dollars for missions
and had seen, as a result of his offering, only one such convert as Miss Singh he would still
have considered his offering a most profitable investment.

These women are creating their own opportunities and will, ere long, achieve much in all the
ranks of life and especially in their own peculiar sphere of womanly activity and influence.
Woman will do more for the progress and development of the country than the sterner sex, as
she has hitherto done more than he to conserve and dignify the past. And it is safe to conclude
that the womanhood of India will discover its chief glory as it now finds its largest opportunity
in Christianity. And I may add that the mission of Christianity to, and in behalf of, the women
of that land may almost be called its chief mission, as the results which it has achieved,
and will yet achieve, in this line, will constitute its chief glory.

At large centres the Indian Christian community is already beginning to feel its power and
is organizing in behalf of its own highest interest.

The “Madras Native Christian Association” is perhaps the strongest organization of the community.
It unites hundreds of the best members and gives them a corporate existence and furnishes opportunity
to render articulate the ideals, ambitions and needs of the Christian community. It has recently
undertaken several enterprises of importance, such as The Twentieth Century Enterprise and
the Indian Christian Industrial Exhibition. It discusses, with much sanity, the most serious
problems of the community and creates a worthy sentiment which will increasingly spread until
it reaches the remotest parts of the country.

All this tends to show that the community is growing conscious both of its strength, its responsibility
and its opportunity.

For the furtherance of this purpose weekly and monthly magazines, both in the English language
and in the vernaculars, are being conducted by them. The Christian Patriot, the best organ
of the community, is published in Madras, is conducted with much ability and represents the
best sentiments of its constituents. It has done much to develop the consciousness of life
and power in the community and has always urged worthy ideals upon its readers.

The seriousness with which all the native Christians of India regard their calling and the
gratitude with which they enjoy their faith is clearly attested by their offerings.

Perhaps nothing can render more satisfactory reply to those who charge the native Christians
with worldly motives than to show how far they deny themselves in behalf of their faith. In
other words the benevolence and offerings of the native Christians may be taken as a fair test
of their sincerity and of their spiritual appreciation. It is a good test in any land. I have
said that they are very poor. A few years ago I investigated carefully the economic conditions
of the most prosperous and largest village congregation of the Madura Mission. I discovered
that five rupees (that is $1.66) was the average monthly income of each family of that congregation.
And that meant only thirty-three cents a month for the support of each member of a family!
We have congregations whose income is less than this. And yet, the Christians of that mission
contributed over two rupees (seventy-five cents) per church member as their offering for 1900.
For all the Protestant Missions of South India the average offering per church member during
1900 was one rupee and nine annas (fifty-two cents). For South India this represented an aggregate
sum of R 248,852 ($85,000) or about seven and one-half per cent, of the total sum expended
in the missions during that year. An American can easily realize how much this offering is
as an absolute gift; but he cannot realize how much of self-denial it means to that very poor
people; nor how large an offering it is as related to the best offerings of our home churches
today. If our American Christians contributed for the cause of Christ a percentage of their
income equal to that of the native Christians of India they would quadruple their benevolence.
And if, in relation to their income, the Christians of India contribute four times as much
as the Christians of America, in relation to their real ability, after supplying the most primitive
needs of their bodies, they contribute a hundred times more than do their brothers and sisters
in this great land of luxury and abundance. Who in America, today, in contributing to the cause
of Christ, denies himself a convenience or a comfort; yea more, who on that account fails to
meet the craving of bodily appetite? And yet there are many Christians in India who suffer
in both these respects in order that they may add the widow’s mite to the treasury of the Church
and their loving offering to advance the Kingdom of the Lord.

In this way the infant Christian Church of India, in its poverty of this world’s goods, is
revealing a wealth of spirit and a richness of purpose such as are worthy of emulation in Christian
lands today.

The organized effort of the Indian Church for self-extension is rapidly multiplying. Every
endeavour is put forth to train them out of that spirit of dependence which is one of the necessary
evils incident to modern missions.

In nearly all well organized missions in India are found, as we have already seen, Home Missionary
Societies, which are conducted and maintained by the people, and which constantly direct their
thoughts to their privilege to further the cause of Christ in their own land and among their
own people.

Work by the young for the young, also, is being conducted with increasing prevalence, zeal
and success throughout the land.

Indeed, all departments of a healthful, normal life and activity are vigorously prosecuted
on mission territory with a view to imparting to the Christians, not only a knowledge of the
highest type of Christian altruism, but also for the purpose of making them partakers of the same.

And the Indian Christian community at present, notwithstanding all its faults and weaknesses,
which I would not conceal, furnishes us much encouragement as a product of past effort and
as a growing power which is to be used by God in the speedy upbuilding of his Kingdom in that
great land of the East.

There are, indeed, not many forms of organized Christian activity conducted by Indian Christians
themselves—apart from Western missions. There are some, however, which are worthy of note and
commendation. Such are Pandita Ramabai’s Mukti Mission for Widows; Miss Chuckerbutty’s flourishing
Orphanages; Mrs. Sorabji’s High School for Women; the Gopalgange Mission started by the Rev.
M. N. Bose, and Dr. P. B. Keskar’s Orphanage and Industrial School at Sholapur.

Recently a novel enterprise was inaugurated in the American Mission, Jaffna, Ceylon, in the
form of a Foreign Missionary Society, which sends forth, to a region in Southern India, its
missionaries to carry the gospel of Christ to the non-Christians of that place. It is chiefly
conducted and supported by the young people of the mission and is prophetic of a movement which
will, ere long, spring up throughout India as a result of a growing sense of responsibility
and opportunity among the Christians of that land.

It is with no spirit of boasting that I wish to dwell upon the share which America has had
in producing these results. Other people have done in some respects, better than we. But there
is no doubt that India is much influenced by our land. America has, for a century, lavishly
given her sons and daughters and expended her wealth for the salvation of India. Her sacrifices
have not been in vain. None have found more hearty response among that people than the American
Missions. Among the many Protestant Missions now at work in that Peninsula less than one-fourth
are American; and, yet in connection with these missions have been gathered and are found nearly
one-half of all of the Protestant Christians of that land. In South India the mission which
has found much the largest success in gathering converts is an American Mission. In North India,
again, one of our missions stands preëminent in the multitude of its Christians, and another,
in the excellence of its educational power and leavening influence. In Western India, also,
America stands first in the acknowledged power and preëminence of one of its missions.

In the organized movements for the young, America again stands conspicuous in that land. As
we study the wonderful activity exercised by Protestant Christianity in behalf of India’s youth,
we are at once impressed by the leadership of American workers as we are by the American methods
used.

The finest Y. M. C. A. building in the Orient is mostly American, both in conception and in
the organized energy and princely offering which made it possible. It stands today in the city
of Madras, as one of the noblest and the most beautiful tributes of western Christian enterprise
to that great land.

The only theological seminary which has been adequately endowed for the training of Protestant
Christian workers in India, is an American one.

Perhaps the best, because the most sane and enterprising, Christian weekly newspaper in the
land is American.

The only Quarterly Review conducted in that land by Protestant Christians was founded by an
American.

And, in the same line, it is interesting to note that American presses and publishing houses
are multiplying and are exercising an ever-widening influence in the redemption of that country.

So largely have all these American agencies been used for the furtherance of Christian truth
and light; and so much have they been welcomed and appropriated by the people, that it may
well be spoken of as “an American Invasion.”

The Bishop of Newcastle, England, referred to this in his last annual sermon. “So far,” he
says, “has America realized the need of winning India to Christ that a hundred years hence,
if the last thirty years’ proportion continue, India will owe its Christianity more to America
than to Great Britain and Ireland combined.” These words are no less significant in their truthfulness
than generous in their appreciation. England has been entrusted with the work of leading that
great people of the Orient, politically and socially, into a larger and higher life. This,
by a strange Providence, has been entrusted to her in consequence of her conquest of that people
seven thousand miles away and seven times her own population. So also has America been favoured
with a fair share of opportunity and of influence as the moral supporter of England in this
unique and unprecedented work. And, while England by the nature of her compact, or conquest,
is somewhat handicapped in this task, so far as her religious influence upon the people is
concerned, America has free access and ample entrance into the heart of the community because
of her disinterested and unrestrained relationship to them.

Her voice to India has always been the voice of a constraining altruism. All her endeavours
in that land have been the outgoings of a world-wide philanthropy and of Christian self-denial.
Therefore, she has been free and unencumbered in all her ambitions for the uplifting of that
people; and she has found the heartiest response and warmest appreciation from those whom she
has sought to bless. Consequently, that noble band of 1,000 of her sons and daughters, who
are today giving themselves to the salvation of India; and the one million dollars sent forth
annually to maintain her work in that land, are fruitful in the highest good and in the richest
result in all parts of the land.

While all this means a great achievement, it means also, and preëminently, a stirring opportunity.
The widest door of opportunity is open to America among her antipodes in that historic land.
Christian effort can nowhere else find heartier welcome or results more encouraging and telling
in the great gathering of eastern nations into the Kingdom of our Lord.

                               Chapter XI.

MISSIONARY RESULTS—(CONTINUED)

1. THE LEAVEN OF CHRISTIANITY.

Our Lord compared his Kingdom to the mustard seed which grew into a tree. This wonderful growth
and development of his Kingdom we considered in the last chapter. He compared it also to the
leaven which was placed in the meal and which leavened the whole lump. We shall now consider
the leavening or assimilating work of his Kingdom as at present witnessed in India.

If a man were to ask me, “wherein do you find the most encouragement as a Christian worker
in India?” I would doubtless reply:—not in the Church and community gathered by the missions,
but outside of the Christian fold, in the institutions, and among the non-Christians, of the
land. It is not in the fields already harvested (though much of joy and promise we certainly
find there), but in the fields whitening for the harvest, that we see the largest hope for
the ultimate conquest of that great people by Christ.

There are in India, at present, a thousand results, movements and tendencies which, to the
thoughtful, watchful, Christian worker, bespeak the rapid coming of the Kingdom of Christ,
even though their testimony is not heard through mission statistical tables, and though their
activity is found mostly outside the visible pale of the Church.

I appreciate the fact that, when we begin to consider these results which lie outside the life
and organization of the Christian community, we need much discernment and discrimination, lest
we ascribe to Christianity alone an influence and an efficiency which it only shares with Western
thought and civilization. But it is not only impossible to separate these forces, in our endeavour
to estimate the share of each in the results achieved; western thought and civilization, both
in their origin and development, are themselves as much the product as they are the expression
of Christianity; so that we need not hesitate much in ascribing to our faith all the results
which the combined energy of these have produced in that land.

Another discrimination is here necessary. In the last chapter we dwelt, almost exclusively,
upon Protestant missionary activity and results. These we were able to measure chiefly through
the concentrated activity and published statistical reports of Protestant Missions. But, in
considering the more indirect and general results there achieved we must not forget that they
must be ascribed to all the Christian agencies at work in that land. I believe that Protestant
Christianity is much the largest Christian power among all the forces that make for the redemption
of India. And yet it would be presumptuous and unjust not to recognize the strenuous activity
and pervasive influence of Roman Catholicism in the land. I am convinced that that great historic
Church, with all its errors and false methods, is nevertheless a positive and a mighty power
in the dissemination of Christian thought and principles in India. In the results which I am
about to mention, this and all other Christian agencies have had their share.

Some of these activities, indeed, seem to come directly from none of the organized agencies
of Christianity in the land. But they are only apparently so. They are among the thousand subtle
influences which work in a quiet way in the minds and life of the people and which suddenly,
from time to time, break upon our sight through their results. An illustration of this kind
occurred not long ago. It is said that one of the vernacular versions of the Gospels accidentally
fell into the hands of a Mohammedan Moulvi, or teacher, in North India. It had been prepared
and published by the Bible Society. The Mussulman read the book with eagerness, chiefly with
a view to find new arguments against the divinity of our Lord and the heavenly source of our
faith. But, as he read, he was so impressed with the wonderful narrative and the unique beauty
of the character of our Lord, that he surrendered himself to him as his Saviour and found in
him peace and rest. Sometime later he met a Hindu fakir, named Chet Ram, who was earnestly
in search of the truth. The Mohammedan convert joyfully told him of his newly found Saviour
and gave him his copy of the New Testament that he might find for himself the same blessing.
The Holy Spirit carried the Gospel message of life into his heart also, and he accepted Christ
and at once began to preach him unto his friends and neighbours. This work he performed faithfully;
and he gathered around himself many who accepted his following, short creed;—“I believe in
Jesus Christ the Son of Mary and in the Holy Ghost and in the Father to whom prayer should
be made and in the Bible through which salvation is to be received.” Chet Ram died some time
ago; but there are today found, scattered through the villages of North India, thousands of
his followers who subscribed to his brief creed and who always carry upon their persons a copy
of the Scriptures. So far as I know, these people have never come into contact with Christian
workers, but have been led simply through a study of God’s Word, under the guidance of God’s
Spirit, unto Christ the Saviour of the world.

It is one of the most encouraging facts connected with Christian influence in India that one
so often and unexpectedly meets its manifestations in individual life and institutions. Suddenly
he comes across little streams of influence whose source may be unknown, but which do a great
deal towards fertilizing thought and producing a harvest of religious results throughout the land.

The general subject of the influence of the West upon the East has been recently raised in
the very interesting and thought-provoking book on “Asia and Europe” by the English writer,
Meredith Townsend. He stiffly maintains that the West never has, and, probably, never will,
seriously and permanently influence the East in thought and life. While there is a semblance,
yea an element, of truth in his contention, so far as the past is concerned, it fails to apply
to the India of the present and must fall far wide of the mark in the future. Many years have
elapsed since the author of “Asia and Europe” left India; and he is not conversant, at first
hand, with the mighty revolution which is taking place there at present. He fails, for one
thing, to appreciate the wonderful influence of modern scientific discovery as a unifier of
all peoples and as the handmaid of western life and thought and of Christian conquest. I need
refer only to one of these modern agencies—the telegraph. The election of Mr. McKinley as president
of the United States was known to me in India before it was known to nine-tenths of the population
of this land.

The calamity which recently befell Galveston, Texas, was not only known to Hindus, the very
next day; the price of cotton went up in South India villages as a consequence of that sad
event. The generous offerings recently contributed in America for the famine sufferers in India
were actually distributed to them in food the next day after they were offered! Can these things,
and a thousand like them, which enter into the every-day transactions of East and West, have
no permanent influence upon the relations of these once remote but now neighbouring people?
Isolation has everywhere given way to intercourse and mutual dependence; and that means community
of life and thought which produces fundamental action and reaction.

Under these new and marvellous conditions the former “mental seclusion of India,” so unduly
emphasized by Mr. Townsend, is rapidly yielding and must utterly pass away. It will, however,
not pass away simply because of the influence of the West upon the East, but rather because
of the mutual action and reaction of East and West. The East will approach the West because,
to a large extent, the West will have learned to appreciate, and to draw in sympathy towards,
the East. Herein lies the secret of the future oneness, or at least of the communion, of the
two great hemispheres.

India is, therefore, in this matter, facing today such conditions as never before existed there;
and these are to further considerably the work of revolution which our religion is bringing
to pass in that land, and which such pessimists as Mr. Townsend are wont to ignore.

That keen philosopher and high authority upon India, Sir Alfred Lyall, is right in his anticipation
when he claims that India “will be carried swiftly through phases which have occupied long
stages in the lifetime of other nations.”

Considering, then, the leavening influences and the general results of our faith in that land
we shall see them in many institutions and departments of life.

(a) In laws which the government of India has enacted during the last century.

There has been a steady conflict between the enlightened government of the white man and the
inhuman customs of the people of that land. The Christian sentiment of the members of the government,
and of other Christians outside of that circle, has ever rebelled against and sought to put
down the grossest evils which obtain there.

And the fact which we need to emphasize here is that these evils have been directed and protected
by Hinduism itself and are an integral part of its ceremonies and teachings. Whenever the government
has sought, by legislation, to do away with these inhuman rites and customs it has been bitterly
opposed by Hinduism and has been met by a general uprising of its followers against what they
have called religious interference and persecution. Thus the suppression of Thuggism was a
definite attack upon a religious institution, for the Thuggs never committed a murder, save
as a part of their worship of the goddess Bhowanee to whose service they had dedicated themselves
and to which the blood of the innocent traveller (as they thought) was the most welcome sacrifice
its devotee could offer. Hence the difficulty which faced the government in bringing these
religious murders to an end.

Suttee was also regarded as a high type of religious devotion. For the widow to immolate herself
upon the funeral pyre of her dead husband was not only the supreme test of wifely devotion,
it was also preëminently the highest religious act possible to her; and it brought to her a
future bliss which was painted in glowing and attractive colours by the sacred books of her
faith. It was not strange, therefore, that the State hesitated, for a long time, to abolish
by law this hideous custom, whereby in the year 1817, for instance, two widows were burned
daily in the Bengal Presidency alone.

It was in the face of extensive protest and threats by orthodox Hindus that the government
abolished it. “Previous to 1857, 150 human sacrifices are said to have been annually offered
in Gumsur, a city in East Central India; and the abolition of that horrible custom raised such
a storm of opposition among the Hindus that an eight years’ war was the result. More than 2,000
victims were rescued from sacrifice and handed over to the care of the missionaries.” In like
manner infanticide was encouraged for centuries in the land as an act of religious devotion
which was possessed of great efficacy. In the name of religion and with the promise of its
highest blessings mothers were led to feed the crocodiles of the sacred Ganges by throwing
to them their own infants.

It seems hardly possible that human beings could regard the prohibition of that inhuman and
unnatural act as a piece of injustice and an interference with the rights of conscience. And
yet it was so regarded!

Not fewer than twenty laws have thus been enacted in that land, during the last century, with
a view to putting an end to religious customs which robbed thousands of people, annually, of
life itself and deprived many thousands more of the most elementary and inalienable rights
of human beings. So it has become penal to do any one of the following things, all of which
were regarded as expressions of the highest religious devotion and were committed with the
sanction of the ancestral faith and under the inspiration of its benediction: to burn widows;
to expose parents to death on the banks of the Ganges; to offer up human sacrifice; to murder
children, either by throwing them into the Ganges, or by the Rajpoot secret method of infanticide;
to encourage men to throw away their lives under temple cars and in other ways of religious
devotion; to encourage various forms of voluntary self-torture and self-mutilation; to outrage
girls under a certain age.

How much hath the Spirit of Christ wrought in that land during the century by saving the lives
of millions of poor innocent creatures from the ravages of a savage faith and an inhuman religious
devotion!

Thus, in India today the laws protect the people, old and young, from the old murderous customs
of its religion, and gives a sanctity to life and a protection to the innocent and a check
to the mad, suicidal tendency of the religious fanatic, such as India never before knew. And
all this has been done in the teeth of their religion and notwithstanding the persistent cries
and protests of the religious leaders of the people.

I have already mentioned the fact that the obscene and the impure have in many ways been fostered
by that faith, and that the government has thus far been unable to find courage to apply to
religious temples, symbols and rites that legislation which it has enacted against the obscene
in literature and in the ordinary life of the people. And yet, we are encouraged to find there
this anomaly today,—that men, for translating and publishing obscene portions of the Hindu
scriptures, have been punished in accordance with this law. The day will, doubtless, soon come,
it must come, when this legislation against obscenity will be enforced without exception in
favour of temple cars and sacred objects and rites.

In reference to caste observance the State has been more courageous and has absolutely ignored
class distinction among its subjects. No one who has not lived in the East can realize how
radical and important this policy is in that land of class distinctions based upon religious
injunction and revelation. It seemed absurd and unrighteous to that people that the august
and sacred Brahman and the unclean and outcaste Pariah should be regarded as equal before the
law, and that a pauper should enjoy, with a prince, the same protection and blessings from
the State. Regardless of immemorial custom and religious injunction, the government has become
the great leveller—it has ignored entirely, in all the rights and privileges which it has to
confer, every caste distinction and class privilege and disability which Hinduism had created
and sacredly maintained for centuries. And it adheres stiffly to its Christian principle of
the equal rights of all its subjects.

(b) Moreover, Hinduism itself is being gradually transformed under the search-light of a present
Christianity.

Not only has it been compelled, from without, to give up some of its inhuman practices, it
has also voluntarily, from very shame, relinquished some of its grossest evils.

There is a very interesting conflict now going on in Hinduism—between the ultra-conservatives
and the progressives. This latter class is composed almost entirely of men who have been educated
in mission and government schools, and who have been influenced by Christian light and life.

I do not expect much from a Christianized Hinduism any more than I do from a Hinduized Christianity.
And yet we cannot be unmindful of, nor ungrateful for, that growing sense of shame which leads
that faith to conceal, if not to abandon entirely, some of its worst crimes against man and
to adorn itself in such a way that it may not too violently shock the sensibilities of a people
who are living under the growing light of a Christian civilization.

This is what the ancestral faith of India is now intent upon doing, at least so far as the
changing situation compels. The influence of educated Hindus upon the pundits and other religious
guides of the land is increasing annually, and is steadily in favour of religious reform and
of a broad and enlightened interpretation of Shastraic deliverances upon religious customs.
For example, a few years ago, sea voyages were strictly prohibited to all Hindus. No exceptions
were allowed and excommunication was the inevitable penalty for the violation of this religious
injunction. Today hundreds of Hindus, impelled by an ambition for the best education and for
a broad culture, annually travel to England and to other foreign lands. Though some of those
men are punished for their temerity in defying this sacred injunction of their faith, it is
remarkable how many pundits arise to defend such travel and to reduce the opprobrium which
overtakes a sea-travelled man. Indeed, every year adds to the ease with which such a man can
avoid punishment for going abroad.

Until recently, Hinduism had no way of reinstating a man who had deserted his ancestral faith
and had thereby broken caste. Today this subject is up for discussion, and many of the religious
leaders are pointing to passages from their Scriptures which justify such a reinstatement and
are showing methods by which it can be effected. In consequence of this not a few back-sliding
Christians have recently found an open door to reenter their ancestral faith. This is an important
move; but I doubt whether it will cause Christians to lose any converts save those who are
not sincere and who would therefore be better outside than within the Christian Church.

A generation ago few Hindus in the villages of the land would fail to defend polytheism and
idolatry as an essential part of their faith. At present the Christian preacher, as he travels
among these same people, finds universal assent to his declaration concerning the unity of
God. I have hardly met one villager in the land who maintains today that there are really “gods
many.” Polytheism is not defended but explained away, and idolatry, it is claimed, is only
an accommodation—a kind of religious kindergarten—for the sake of the very ignorant, and “for
women and children.” But of course, pantheism is the Hindu’s conception of the divine unity.

Whenever an educated Hindu defends his faith, in an argument with a Christian, he never quotes
as scriptural authority the more recent writings of their faith—the Tantras and Puranas, which
are the storehouse of legend and myth, of myriad rites and customs and are the refuge and joy
of the orthodox and conservative pandits;—he discards these and falls back upon the most ancient
writings, which are the exponents of nature worship and of vedantic philosophy. Or he will
extol the Bhagavat Gita, which is an eclectic attempt to unify and approve the conflicting
philosophies of Brahmanism.

In these, and in many other ways, Hinduism finds today new presentation and defence. It is
not the thing it used to be. And yet in matters of fundamental importance it is and will remain
unchanged. In some respects these changes make that ancient faith less vulnerable to attack.
In the words of Doctor Robson,—“The influence of Christianity upon Hinduism has been rather
to strengthen its rival by forcing it to abandon certain positions which weakened it, and bringing
it more into accordance with natural religion. But Hinduism remains the same. The contest is
coming to be between the ultimate principles of the two religions, and these are irreconcilable.”(14)
Yes, it will be a good day for Christianity when the great contest is thus narrowed down, and
when the deepest teachings of the two faiths will be placed in clear and simple juxtaposition.

One serious source of danger in this controversy lies in the Neo-Hinduism which interprets
Hinduism in the light of Christian truth and modern thought. Hindus formerly maintained that
the teachings of Christianity were false. Now they tell us that most of its truths were taught
by their own faith even before the Christian era! Through the allegories of their Shastras,
and under the guidance of the fertile imagination of that Englishwoman, Mrs. Besant, they find
equally the best Christian truth and most recent results of modern scientific discovery taught
by their ancient scriptures! Mrs. Besant has even discovered that the ten incarnations of Vishnu
are based on strict evolution principles and follow that order.

She claims, indeed, that many of the most recent discoveries in the physical universe were
anticipated and promulgated three millenniums ago by Hindu rishis. This of course is a method
of insanity which will soon give way to a newer craze. For the present it helps to evade or
confuse the issue in certain minds; but as it is in itself a substitution of nonsense for argument
and reason it will not long deceive any one, not even the poor Hindu.

And just as, under the present Christian régime, Hinduism is rapidly being transformed, no
less truly does the Mohammedan faith undergo change. There is a new Islam arising in India.
That faith cannot be preserved in its rigid integrity under the ægis of a Christian government;
therefore in India the faith of the great Arabian prophet has undergone marked transformation
during the last century and a half. Its religious leaders there are rationalists who scrutinize
and criticise the Koran with the boldness of the higher critics of the Bible. They both urge
that the Koran has no permanent authority on moral questions, and also insist upon progress
in all religious matters.(15)

This young Mohammedan party of progress have found a vigorous leader in Judge Amir Ali Sahib,
a brilliant writer, who hesitates not to explain away or antagonize all those teachings of
his faith which lie athwart the path of progress and enlightenment.

He avows, in his book on “The Spirit of Islam,” that his purpose is to assist “the Muslims
of India to achieve intellectual and moral regeneration under the auspices of the Great European
Power that now holds their destiny in its hands.” “The reformers,” he further writes, “are
congratulated that the movement set on foot is conducted under a neutral government.” Thus
a Mussulman writer declares that the highest reforms can best be conducted under a Christian
government!

All this is illustrative of that leavening influence of our faith as it comes into contact
with and permeates the spirit and teaching of these and other religions of that land.

(c) Another marked result of Christianity in that country is seen in the attitude of many thousands
of Hindus who live contiguous to the Christian communities found there.

In the first place we see it among the common people. I have already referred to mass movements
which have largely helped to strengthen the Christian Church in the past. Those movements have
only just begun; they will continue and increase in the land. Day by day Christianity is commending
itself to the people in a thousand ways. In times of famine, when the old religious leaders
of the people—the Brahmans—render no help and manifest no sympathy, yea more, are as rapacious
as ever, the loving sympathy of Christians there and in far off lands, and their outgoing charity
and their substantial help to the famine stricken and the suffering—all this does not fall
in vain upon the susceptible mind of the people.

This work of Christianity in uniting the world through brotherhood and sympathy seems wonderful
to a people who are crushed and robbed by the wretched divisiveness of their own terrible caste
system. They recognize also the truth and the life which Christianity presents in contrast
with the debasing idolatry and the senseless, all-pervasive ceremonialism which haunt them.

It is not surprising therefore that we see, not only certain mass movements towards our faith
but also, on the outskirts of the Christian community in every district, a growing number of
doubting, halting ones—those who have done with their ancestral faith and who are attracted
by the religion of Christ, but who are so much afraid of the terrible demon, caste, that they
dare not openly accept Christ and unite with God’s people through baptism. They linger on the
outside, hoping for some great tide of influence to come, soon, to carry them, without persecution,
into the kingdom. Their attitude of mind is encouraging, and the missionary hopes for the day
which will furnish the strength and opportunity for this great host of weak and doubting ones
to make its decision for Christ and to enter, in ever-increasing numbers, into His Kingdom.

I have come into daily, close touch with many men and women of this class. They, at the same
time, encourage and exasperate one. They give evidence of the strong influence of our faith
upon them—they have ceased to visit Hindu temples, they decline to worship the family and tribal
gods, they lose no opportunity to denounce the idolatry and superstitions which have debased
them, and they always speak to their friends a warm word for Christianity and often attend
its meetings in their village. But there they continue to stand. They are the slaves of caste
fear and of social inertia. While, however, they stand and wait they often say the word and
give the encouragement which enable others to accept Christ openly and to enter the Christian fold.

They are also always glad to send their children to our schools and are willing to have them
instructed in the truth and guided into the life of our faith. They often contribute towards
the support of Christian pastor or teacher, and in various other ways evince their sympathy
and reveal their intellectual assent.

For instance:—In Tinnevelly there is a hall built by such a Hindu to commemorate the late Queen
Victoria, in which lectures and entertainments are held. Christian ministers are frequently
asked to pray at these gatherings; and former years have witnessed requests by the donor for
prayer, from well-known ministers and bishops. Such appreciation of Christian worship is very
pleasing, particularly as the proprietor is a member of a committee that has the oversight
of nearly 300 Sivite temples in the district.

They also show their appreciation of the medical work of Christian missions. In the city of
Madura stands one of the finest hospitals in the country. It is the property of the American
Board, but was erected, at an expense of $14,000 by members of the orthodox Hindu community
as a monument of their appreciation of the mission physician and of their confidence in the
mission and its work.

(d) Another marked feature of the religious life of India, at present, is the existence there
of several new cults or religions. They not only add picturesqueness to the religious situation,
they also reveal the unrest of the people and their desire for something better than the orthodox
faith of their fathers furnishes them.

Having become dissatisfied and disgusted with their ancestral religion, they are striving in
every possible way, short of being Christians, to seek for something better and higher. This
is what we should expect. In the many schools and colleges of the land the subtle metaphysics
of the East is supplanted by the modern philosophy of the West; their own bewildering ancient
rules of logic are replaced by the more rational processes of the West. So that every university
matriculate and graduate of India is today crammed with ideas, and trained in methods of thinking,
which make a belief in practical Hinduism and in much of its philosophy an impossibility, if
not an absurdity.

Thus we see in that land today a number of movements and organizations which are a protest
against orthodox Hinduism and are carrying the people, in thought and sympathy, from the past
to the present, from the old to the new. Most of these movements are merely half-way houses
between Hinduism and Christianity. They are with faces more or less turned towards the light
and possess the progressive spirit which, in some cases, cannot fail of landing their members,
at no distant date in the Christian fold. For instance, we have in western India the Prartanei
Somaj (prayer society); in north India the Arya Somaj (Aryan society), and in Bengal the Brahmo
Somaj (society of God).

These are healthy movements, away from a general, old-fashioned view of religious things. Take,
for example, the Brahmo Somaj. Though not as large in membership as the Arya Somaj it represents
more culture and power. Nearly all the members are men of education and of western training,
and represent much more influence than their number (4,000) would suggest. Their new faith
is an eclecticism. It has adopted a little of Hinduism and of Buddhism and of Mohammedanism
and a great deal of Christianity. The movement, especially that progressive branch which was
under the leadership of Protab Chunder Mozumdar, is largely Christian in drift and spirit.
Mozumdar accepts Christ, though not in the fullness of belief in His divinity or in His atoning
work; nevertheless with an amount of appreciation, affection, devotion and loyalty not met
even among many Western Christians today. His book on “The Oriental Christ” is full of appreciation
and reveals a wonderful knowledge of the eastern Christ from an Eastern standpoint. I shall
not be surprised to see the members of this society landing, at an early date, through a full
confession of Christ, in membership of the Christian Church.

In the meanwhile it is disappointing to find this organization divided, already, into so many
mutually antagonistic sects. It is also a reason for regret that Mozumdar, who is a man of
great culture, intelligence and deep spiritually, has recently relinquished the leadership
of the movement. Having retired to the Himalayas, he communicates his reasons in these truly
oriental, pathetic and pessimistic words:

“Age and sickness get the better of me in these surroundings, I cannot work as I would—contemplation
is distracted, concentration disturbed, though I struggle ever so much. These solitudes are
hospitable; these breadths, heights and depths are always suggestive. I acquire more spirit
with less struggle, hence I retire.

“My thirst for the higher life is growing so unquenchable that I need the time and the grace
to reëxamine and purify and reform every part of my existence. The Spirit of God promises me
that grace if I am alone. So let me alone.

“The rich are so vain and selfish, the poor are so insolent and mean, that having respect for
both I prefer to go away from them.

“The learned think so highly of themselves, the ignorant are so full of hatred and uncharitableness,
that having good will for both I prefer to hide myself from all.

“The religious are so exclusive, the sceptical so self-sufficient that it is better to be away
from both.

“Where are the dead? Have not they too retired? I wish my acquaintance with the dead should
grow, that my communion with them should be spontaneous, perpetual, unceasing. I will invoke
them and wait for them in my hermitage.

“What is life? Is it not a fleeting shadow, the graveyard of dead hopes, the battlefield of
ghastly competitions, the playground of delusions, separations, cruel changes and disappointments?
I have had enough of these. And now with the kindliest love for all, I must prepare and sanctify
myself for the great Beyond, where there is solution for so many problems, and consolation
for so many troubles....”

This seems an unworthy ending to a very worthy life. And yet a movement which has created two
such men as Chunder Sen and Protab Mozumdar is a compliment to Christianity and has a mission
before it. But it must undergo many changes ere it can exercise a commanding influence in the land.

A much more popular movement is the Arya Somaj. The recent census reports 40,000 members of
this organization. If Brahmo Somaj represents the working of that Hindu mind which has been
imbued with European culture and Christian thought towards a solution of its religious doubts
and problems; the Arya Somaj represents a strong Theistic movement springing forth out of Hinduism
itself. This latter movement is possessed of unwonted vigour and has a future before it. The
founder of this Somaj was Dyanand Sarasvati, a Brahman who was born about the year 1825. He
was a man of much thought and of deep religious interest. He was entirely ignorant of the English
language. He broke with orthodox Hinduism after reading the Christian Scriptures. And yet he
also attacked the character of Jesus. He accepted the Hindu Vedas as Scriptures, but interpreted
them so freely that he was able to find in them all that he desired of religious reform. He
vigorously opposed caste.

The following are some of the principles of the Arya Somaj:

1. God is the primary source of all true knowledge.

2. God is perfect in all His attributes and should be worshipped.

3. The Vedas are the books of true knowledge.

4. The caste system is a human invention and is evil.

5. Early marriage is prohibited.

The movement has assumed the aspect of a sect of Hinduism. But some of its fundamental contentions
are so directly antagonistic to most cherished institutions of Hinduism that it is a mighty
disintegrator of that religion in the land.

It must be confessed that the Arya Somaj is, in its present spirit, anti-Christian. It champions
the cause of home religion in the East as against the aggression of the great rival, Christianity.
But the teachers of our faith in India find encouragement equally in the hostility of this
movement and in its coöperation in a common attack upon modern Hinduism. Any movement, that
effectively calls the attention of the people to the weakness and defects of its ancestral
religion, cannot fail, in that very process, to invite their attention to the claims of its
rival, Christianity.

The chief function of all these movements is to reveal the general religious interest of the
people. Indeed, they forward greatly the spirit of discontent towards the ancestral faith.
And while they do this, they themselves furnish a no more satisfying or soul-inspiring substitute.
And in this way they emphasize the need of a new faith and draw the thought of many to the
new supplanting religion of the Christ. Chunder Sen, even twenty years ago, declared that,
“None but Jesus, none but Jesus, none but Jesus is worthy to wear this diadem, India, and He
shall have it.” Yes, even through such movements as the Brahmo Somaj, Christ is winning India
for himself.

The educated classes of India are largely permeated and influenced by Western thought. They
may not be inclined to join any of the reform movements which I have mentioned; but they are
now thinking on absolutely different lines from those of their ancestors fifty years ago. The
dissemination of Western literature, and especially the conduct of so many Christian schools
have done more, perhaps, than any other thing to create an intellectual ferment and to produce
a revolution of thought in all parts of the land.

One cannot unduly emphasize the importance of Christian schools in India. The government schools
and the Hindu institutions of learning are acknowledged to be the hot-beds of rationalism and
of unbelief. They not only furnish no religious instruction to the youth, they too often give
the impression that all religion is a mere superstition and is unworthy of being taught.

To such an extent is this trend and influence observable that the government experiences much
concern, coupled with an expressed, though vague, desire, that this evil be arrested by the
introduction, into all public schools, of some method of imparting at least the fundamental
principles of religion. But to discover the method of accomplishing this, without violating
the principle of religious neutrality, seems beyond its power.

In the meanwhile mission schools have a grand sphere opened to them on this line. They are
not only a common agency, with governmental and all other higher institutions, in the work
of undermining and destroying vain credulity and the whole brood of superstitions which are
legion in India; they are also a positive and constructive force in the impartation of those
principles of morality and teachings of religion which will ennoble life here and hereafter.
And in this connection it should not be forgotten that all mission schools—higher and lower—enjoy
unlimited opportunity to teach, daily, to all their students God’s Word and to apply its principles
and its saving message to the minds of the half million students who are being trained by them.

I desire to emphasize again the importance of all these schools as the most potent agency,
apart from the native Church itself, in the transformation of the thought and life of India.
It is a noteworthy fact that the only statue erected to a missionary in India was that recently
unveiled by the Governor of Madras in the city of Madras to Dr. Wm. Miller. This noble missionary
educator has wrought mightily, through his great institution in Madras, for the upbuilding
of Christian truth in the minds of Christian and non-Christian youth alike. And this statue
is a unique tribute of gratitude from his “old boys”—most of them still Hindus, indeed—to the
man who has been instrumental in opening before them the broad vistas of Western thought and
of Christian truth and life. But more enduring than marble will abide the blessed results which
he and his colabourers have wrought in the thought and life of the more than 2,000 graduates
who have been educated by them. Of these there are 1,800 who represent the Hindus of thought
and culture in South India at present. Such is the influence of one Christian school.

If the work of the thousands of village Christian schools is more humble in its aim it is much
more pervasive in its reach, and it marvellously directs thought and inspires life in remote
villages.

Twelve years ago I opened one little primary school in a small unlettered heathen village.
Ten bright Hindu boys sought instruction at the hands of the devout old Christian teacher placed
there. Today these boys have grown into manhood and, with one or two exceptions, have entered
into the Christian life and have been formed into a Christian congregation. They are not only
intelligent, but firm and beautiful in their new-found Christian hope. Moreover, the whole
village is permeated with Christian truth and it resounds with the appeal of our faith. In
this way have come into existence many of the best and strongest congregations of the Christian
Church in India.

But, to return to the educated class in India. We have considered already its attitude of mind
towards the supplanting religion of Jesus.

Their opposition to Christianity, as it is now presented to them, I can appreciate. They are
beginning, for the first time, to think seriously and philosophically about religion. They
are, more than ever before, impatient with their past, and annoyed with the inadequacy of their
present faith. It is not strange if this feeling is shown in their attitude towards the only
supplanting faith. In this matter they are on the way to light and truth. The under-current
is strongly right and in the direction of an enlightened and an enlightening religion. They
are more earnestly in quest of truth than ever before. Moreover it is not substantive Christianity,
but adjectival Christianity—the too Western type of our faith—which arouses their antagonism.
And I must again express my belief that, before Christianity is to gain universal acceptance
by the people of India, it must be dissociated from many Western ideas and practices which
seem to us essential even to its very life. When we learn to forget our antecedents and prejudices
and to study well the Hindu mind and its tendency, then perhaps shall we be prepared to present
a Christianity which will commend itself universally to that land. The Rev. G. T. E. Slater
in his new book, wisely emphasized this same need.

“The West,” he says, “has to learn from the East, and the East from the West. The questions
raised by the Vedanta will have to pass into Christianity if the best minds of India are to
embrace it; and the Church of the ‘farther East’ will doubtless contribute something to the
thought of Christendom, of the science of the soul, and of the omnipenetrativeness and immanence
of Deity.”(16)

But the most encouraging aspect of this question is the present attitude of the mind of educated
India towards Christ himself.

Listen to the words of an orthodox Hindu in a recent lecture delivered to his fellow Hindus:—“How
can we,” he says, “be blind to the greatness, the unrivalled splendour of Jesus Christ. Behind
the British Empire and all European Powers lies the single great personality—the greatest of
all known to us—of Jesus Christ. He lives in Europe and America, in Asia and Africa as King
and Guide and Teacher. He lives in our midst. He seeks to revivify religion in India. We owe
everything, even this deep yearning towards our own ancient Hinduism, to Christianity.”

All former antipathy to, and depreciation of Jesus, our Lord, have given way to appreciation
and admiration. They vie with each other in a study of His life and regard Him as the only
perfect Exemplar of man. That great land which has never found in its old faith an ideal of
life is now finding it in our blessed Lord. This movement towards Him is remarkable. They are
enthroning Him in their imagination and are drawing Him to their hearts.

A Braham friend of mine—a devout Hindu, a university graduate, a barrister and a leader of
the Hindu community, requested me to purchase for him a pocket copy of Thomas a Kempis’ “Imitation
of Christ.” He possessed a large copy, but desired a small one which he could carry with him
and could use for devotional purposes on his journeys. Some of his friends sought other copies
through him. Thus they bought all the copies that I could find for sale in South India. He
also asked me to buy for him a copy of Dr. Sheldon’s book, “In His Steps.”

I bought four dozen copies and sold all to Brahmans and to native Christians. One of our pastors
bought a copy. He soon handed it to a Brahman friend—a government official and a university
graduate—requesting him to read it. This he did, and, returning with the book a few days later,
he earnestly said—“Sir, why don’t you bring us more such books as this. We also want to know
more of Christ and to follow ‘In His Steps.’ ”

Indeed, I find a wonderful eagerness among Hindus of culture to know all that can be known
about the life and teaching of our Lord, even though they are not prepared to accept his atonement
as their salvation. The same fact is true among the common people. There are not a few who
believe that the tenth—that is, the coming—incarnation of Vishnu (Kalki avatar) refers to Christ.
A Hindu Saivite devotee told me once that they proposed soon to place in their monastery an
image of Christ (as they had one of Vishnu) and thus render to Him worship in common with the
others. I am confident that Hindus, all but unanimously, would, today, vote to give him a place
in their pantheon and a share in their worship, if Christians would accede to this. “Did we
not,” they say, “thus appropriate Buddha, the arch-enemy of Brahmanism, twenty-five centuries
ago, and make him the ninth incarnation of Vishnu? And why should we not regard Christ, also,
as the tenth ‘descent’ of our beloved Vishnu.”

I deem this trend towards Christ, and it is marked especially among the educated in all parts
of India, as the greatest encouragement to the Christian worker in that land today.

I care not so much whether they accept our faith in its Western form and spirit, so long as
I see them growing in their appreciation of, and devotion to the Christ. Through Him I am sure
they will pass on to some outer expression or other of their faith in Him—an expression which
will doubtless correspond with their own oriental turn of thought and life.

CONCLUSION.

Thus, whether we look at the growing Christian community and its many cheering features of
life and of activity; or whether we study the non-Christian community and all the social and
national institutions of that land, we find large encouragement and a rich assurance of the
speedy coming of the Kingdom of our Lord.

Nearly a century ago—the very time in which America, through the America Board, sent its first
missionaries to that great land—the Directors of the East India Company placed on record their
sentiments in the following words:

“The sending of Christian missionaries to our Eastern possessions is the maddest, most expensive,
most unwarranted project that was ever proposed by a lunatic enthusiast.” This was, at that
time, the conviction and the confession of the English rulers of India. It was the voice of
unbelief and the declaration of defiant opposition. How different the attitude and the words
of Sir Rivers Thompson; the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, near the close of that same century.
“In my judgment,” he says, “Christian missionaries have done more real and lasting good to
the people of India than all other agencies combined.” Certainly, a no more competent witness
than he, and a no more conclusive evidence than his, could be desired.

In my compound in South India, for a quarter of a century, a date palm tree grew and flourished.
Years later a seed was carried by a bird and dropped at the foot of this palm tree. It was
the seed of the sacred boh tree. It also sprouted and its slender, subtle shoot wound round
the sturdy palm. Every year it grew higher until it finally towered above the date palm; and
the higher it grew the more its winding stem thickened; and as it thickened it began to tighten
its grip upon the other tree. That grip, so weak and innocent at first, soon became to the
palm tree a grip of death. For every day so added to the encircling power of the boh tree that,
about three years ago, it completely enshrouded and killed the palm. Today that boh tree stands
alone, indicating, by its spiral form, where the unfortunate palm found its death; and it stretches
forth its beautiful branches in rich verdure and in welcome shade to all who seek refuge from
the heat of the tropical sun.

This is only a parable of the struggle which is witnessed in India today. For many centuries
the tree of Brahmanism has flourished. It covers that whole land. But at its very root has
been sown the seed of God’s Word and there is growing out of it, in its beauty and strength,
the sacred tree of our Faith. Already it has the old tree in its almighty grip. The work of
death is progressing and the final issue is sure.

But it will not transpire in a day. The victory will come, is now coming.

But the resources of Hinduism are legion, and its strange fascination, to some extent, continues.
India, which is increasingly becoming Christ’s in thought and ideals, will become his in worship
and ritual, when his name shall be heard in every home throughout the land. But we need patience;
and the grand result to be achieved is worthy of the noblest endurance and of the most patient
waiting.

Christian workers in that great land are faithfully labouring and hopefully waiting until the
fruitful branches of the sacred tree of Christianity shall have spread over the whole land,
so that its shade may be the refuge of all souls in distress and its fruit shall abound for
the healing of all the nations of India.

The resources and the agencies of our Faith, which are now utilized for the furtherance of
the truth in that land, are already wonderfully varied and potent; but they are also increasing
annually in prevailing power as in bewildering variety. Every Christian drawn from Hinduism
and added to the fold of Christ becomes, in himself, a force to draw and to win others to Christ.
This power has already become the main agency in the growth of the church, and its efficiency
is to grow in geometric ratio as the years increase.

The great need of India today is the power of the Holy Spirit of God. His people must bring
themselves much more into subjection to his Spirit, that they may, the more fully, be the vehicles
of His grace to others and the channel of His power in the land. The dangers of God’s Church
are, and will preëminently be, dangers from within rather than from without. It is Hinduism,
godlessness and sin within which must be fought with an eternal vigilance and an uncompromising
hostility. And for this a larger baptism will mean a mighty fire of God kindled in the whole
Church such as will burn all its dross and consume all opposition. And then shall we speedily
witness the great desire of our heart—a happy, prosperous India, because it will be Emmanuel’s
land—a part of the great Fold of Christ.

This consummation is as sure as God’s own promises, for, in all his work, the missionary is
not only encouraged by results achieved and by assurances given, but also by the double promise
of God.

    1 Some of these, doubtless, are only well-developed dialects. Many
      other, more imperfect, dialects might be added to this total.

    2 The extensive famines of the last few years have reduced this
