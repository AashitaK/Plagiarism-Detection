I thought slavery wuz right. I felt that this wuz the way things had to go, the way they were
fixed to go. I wuz satisfied. The white folks treated me all right. My young missus loved me
and I loved her. She whupped me sometimes. I think just for fun sometimes, when I wuz ridin'
behind her, she would tell me to put my arms around her and hold to her apron strings. One
day she wuz sittin' on the side saddle; I wuz sittin' behind her. She wud try to git old Dave,
the horse she wuz a ridin to walk; she would say, 'Ho Dave', den I wud kick de horse in de
side and she wud keep walkin' on. She asked me, 'Joe, why does Dave not want to stop?'

I saw a lot of Yankees, I wuz afraid of 'em. They called us Johnnie, Susie, and tole us they
wouldn't hurt us.

I think Abraham Lincoln is all right, I guess, the way he saw it. I think he was like I wuz
as a boy from what I read, and understand; he wuz like me jest the way he saw things. I liked
the rules, and ways o' my old master and missus, while the Yankees and Abraham Lincoln gave
me more rest.

How did I learn to read? Atter de war I studies. I wonts ter read de hymms an' songs. I jis
picks up de readin' myself.

It's quare to me, I cannot remember one word my mother ever said to me, not nary a word she
said can I remember. I remember she brought me hot potlicker and bread down to the house of
mornings when I wuz small; but I'se been tryin to 'member some words she spoke to me an' I cain't.

SUSAN HIGH 519 Haywood Street Raleigh, N. C.

My name is Susan High. I wus born in June. I am 70 years old. My mother wus named Piety an'
she belonged to de ole man Giles Underhill before de surrender. My father he wus George Merritt
an' he belonged to Ben Merritt, Ivan Proctor's grandfather. Dey lived on a plantation near
Eagle Rock, Wake County. Dey called de creek near by Mark's Creek.

My parents said dat dey had a mighty hard time, an' dat durin' slavery time, de rules wus mighty
strict. De hours of work on de farm wus from sun to sun wid no time 'cept at Christmas and
at lay-by time, 4th of July for anything but work. Dey were not 'lowed no edication, and very
little time to go to church. Sometimes de went to de white folks church. Mother said dey whupped
de slaves if dey broke de rules.

Dey said de overseers were worse den de slave owners. De overseers were ginerally white men
hired by de marster. My father said dey had poor white men to overseer, and de slave owner
would go on about his business and sometimes didn't know an' didn't eben care how mean de overseer
wus to de slaves.

Dere wus a lot o' things to drink, dey said, cider, made from apples, whiskey, an' brandy.
Dey said people didn't notice it lak dey do now, not many got drunk, cause dere wus plenty
of it. Father said it wus ten cents a quart, dat is de whiskey made outen corn, and de brandy
wus cheap too.

Dey said de clothes were wove, an' dat mos' chillun went barefooted, an' in dere shirt tails;
great big boys, goin' after de cows, and feedin' de horses, an' doin' work around de house
in deir shirt tails. Grown slaves got one pair o' shoes a year an' went barefooted de res'
o' de time. Biscuit wus a thing dey seldom got.

Women cleared land by rollin' logs into piles and pilin' brush in de new grounds. Dey were
'lowed patches, but dey used what dey made to eat. Daddy said dey didn't have time to fish
and hunt any. Dey were too tired for dat. Dey had to work so hard.

Daddy said he wus proud o' freedom, but wus afraid to own it. Dey prayed fer freedom secretly.
When de Yankees come daddy saved a two horse wagon load of meat for marster by takin' it off
in de swamp and hidin' it, an' den marster wouldn't give him nary bit uv it. After de surrender,
dey turned him out wid a crowd o' little chillun wid out a thing. Dey give him nothin'. My
mother saved her marster's life, Charles Underhill.

Well you see he wus takin' care uv a lot o' meat and whiskey for Dick Jordon, an' de Yankees
come an' he treated 'em from whiskey he had in a bottle, an' tole 'em he had no more. Dey searched
his home an' found it in a shed room, an' den dey said dey were goin' to kill him for tellin'
'em a lie. She herd [HW correction: heard] 'em talkin' and she busted through de crowd and
told 'em dat de stuff belonged to anudder man and dat her marster was not lyin', an' not to
hurt 'im. De Yankees said, 'You have saved dis ole son of a bitch, we won't kill' em den.'
Dey took all de meat, whiskey, an' everything dey wanted. Marster promised mother a cow, and
calf, a sow, and pigs for what she had done for him an' to stay on an' finish de crop. When
de fall o' de year come he did not give her de wrappin's o' her finger. Dat's what my mudder
tole me. We wus teached to call 'em mammie and pappie. I is gwine to tell you just zackly like
it is we were taught dese things. I wants to be pasidefily right in what I tell you.

We lef' dat place an' mammie an' pappie farmed wid Solomon Morgan a Free Issue for several
years. De family had typhoid fever an' five were down with it at one time. But de Lawd will
provide. Sich as dat makes me say people wont die till deir time comes. Dere is some mighty
good white people in dis place in America, and also bad. If it hadn't been for 'em we colored
folks would have ben in a mighty bad fix. We got our jobs and help from 'em to git us to de
place we are at. Dr. Henry Montague doctored us and none died. It wusn't dere time to go. No,
no, hit wasn't deir time to go. We then moved back to Marster's for a year, and then we moved
to Rolesville in Wake County.

I married den and moved to Raleigh. I married Robert High. He is dead. He been dead 'bout 30
years. I don't know much 'bout Abraham Lincoln I think he wus a fine man. Mr. Roosevelt's ideas
is fine if he can carry 'em out.

I tole you yisterday dat my age wus 76 years old, but my daughter come home, an' I axed her'
bout it an' she say I is 77 years old. I don't know exactly the date but I wus born in April.
I wus a little girl 'bout five years ole when de surrender come, but I don't' member anything
much' bout de Yankees.

I wus born in Virginia, near Petersburg, an' mother said de Yankees had been hanging' round
dere so long dat a soldier wus no sight to nobody.

'Bout de time de Yankees come I' member hearin' dem talk 'bout de surrender. Den a Jew man
by the name of Isaac Long come to Petersburg, bought us an' brought us to Chatham County to
a little country town, named Pittsboro. Ole man Isaac Long run a store an' kept a boarding
house. We stayed on de lot. My mother cooked. We stayed there a long time atter de war. Father
wus sent to Manassas Gap at the beginning of de war and I do not 'member ever seein' him.

My mother wus named Viney Jefferson an' my father wus named Thomas Jefferson. We 'longed to
the Jeffersons there and we went by the name of Jefferson when we wus sold and brought to N.
C. I do not 'member my grandparents on my mother's or father's side. Mother had one boy an'
three girls. The boy wus named Robert, an' the girls were Kate, Rosa and Kitty. Marster Long
bought mother an' all de chilluns, but mother never seed father anymore atter he wus sent off
to de war.

I married Green Hill in Chatham County. I married him at Moncure about nine miles from Pittsboro.
We lived at Moncure and mother moved there an' we lived together for a long time. When we left
Moncure we come ter Raleigh. Mother had died long time 'fore we left Moncure, Chatham County.
We moved ter Raleigh atter de World War.

Mother used ter tell we chilluns stories of patterollers ketchin' niggers an' whuppin' 'em
an' of how some of de men outrun de patterollers an' got away. Dere wus a song dey used to
sing, it went like dis. Yes sir, ha! ha! I wants ter tell you dat song, here it is:

    'Somefolks say dat a nigger wont steal, I caught two in my corn
    field, one had a bushel, one had a peck, an' one had rosenears,
    strung 'round his neck. Yes she said dey wus good ter her
in Virginia. Mother said de slave men on de Jefferson plantation in
Virginia would steal de hosses ter ride ter dances at night. One time a
hoss dey stole an' rode ter a dance fell dead an' dey tried ter tote him
home. Mother laughted a lot about dat. I heard my mother say dat de
cavalry southern folks was bout de meanest in de war. She talked a lot
about Wheeler's cavalry.

Dere wus a lot of stealin' an' takin' meat, silver, stock an' anything. Hosses, cows an' chickens
jist didn't have no chance if a Yankee laid his eyes on 'em. A Yankee wus pisen to a yard full
of fowls. Dey killed turkeys, chickens and geese. Now dats de truth. Mother said de Yankees
skinned turkeys, chickens and geese 'fore dey cooked 'em. Sometimes dey would shoot a hog an'
jist take de hams an' leave de rest dere to spile. Dey would kill a cow, cut off de quarters
an' leave de rest ter rot.

Mother said no prayer meetings wus allowed de slaves in Virginia where she stayed. Dey turned
pots down ter kill de noise an' held meetings at night. Dey had niggers ter watch an' give
de alarm if dey saw de white folks comin'. Dey always looked out for patterollers. Dey were
not allowed any edication an' mother could not read and write nuther.

I 'member de Ku Klux an' how dey beat people. One night a man got away from 'em near whar we
lived in Chatham County. He lived out in de edge of de woods; and when dey knocked on de door
he jumped out at a back window in his night clothes wid his pants in his hands an' outrun 'em.
Dere wus rocks in de woods whar he run an' dat nigger jist tore his feet up. Dey went ter one
nigger's house up dere an' de door' wus barred up. Dey got a ax an' cut a hole in de door.
When de hole got big enough de nigger blammed down on 'em wid a gun an' shot one of dere eyes
out. You know de Ku Klux went disguised an' when dey got ter your house dey would say in a
fine voice, Ku Klux, Ku Klux, Ku Klux, Ku Klux.

[HW correction: New paragraph] Some people say dey are in slavery now an' dat de niggers never
been in nothin' else; but de way some of it wus I believe it wus a bad thing. Some slaves fared
all right though an' had a good time an' liked slavery.

JERRY HINTON

My full name is Jerry Hinton. I wus borned in February, 1855. I am not able ter work. I work
all I can. I am trying ter do de best I can ter help myself. Yes, just tryin' ter do sumpin,
ain't able ter work much. I am ruptured, an' old. My old house looks 'bout old as I do, it's
'bout to fall down, ain't able ter fix it up. It needs repairing. I ain't able ter make no repairs.

I wus born on a plantation in Wake County. My master wus Richard Seawell, an' Missus wus named
Adelaide. His plantation wus on Neuse River. He had two plantations, but I wus a little boy,
an' don't remember how many acres in de plantation or how many slaves. There wus a lot of 'em
tho'. I would follow master 'round an' look up in his face so he would give me biscuit an'
good things ter eat.

My mother, before marriage, wus named Silvia Seawell, an' father wus named Andrew Hinton. Atter
they wus married mother went by the name of Hinton, my father's family name. I had--I don't
know--mos' anything wus good ter me. Master brought me biscuit an' I thought that wus the greatest
thing at all. Yes, I got purty good food. Our clothes wus not fine, but warm. I went barefooted
mos' o' the time, an' in summer I went in my shirt tail.

Dey called de slave houses 'quarters', de house where de overseer lived wus de 'Overseer's
House'. Master had a overseer to look atter his men; De overseer wus named Bridgers. De house
where Master lived wus de 'Great House'.

Dey would not allow us any books. I cannot read an' write. I have seen de patterollers, but
I neber saw' em whip nobody; but I saw' em lookin' fer somebody ter whup. I've neber seen a
slave sold. I've neber seen a jail fer slaves or slaves in chains. I have seen master whup
slaves though. I wus neber whupped. Dey wrung my ears an' pulled my nose to punish me.

Dere wus no churches on de plantation, but we had prayer meetin's in our homes. We went to
de white folks church. My father used to take me by de hand an' carry me ter church. Daddy
belonged ter de Iron Side Baptist Church. We called our fathers 'daddy' in slavery time. Dey
would not let slaves call deir fathers 'father'. Dey called 'em 'daddy', an' white children
called deir father, 'Pa'. I didn't work any in slavery time, 'cept feed pigs, an' do things
fer my master; waited on him. I went 'round wid him a lot, an' I had rather see him come on
de plantation any time dan to see my daddy. I do not remember any possums or other game being
eaten at our house. I do not remember eber goin' a-fishin durin' slavery time.

Master had two boys ter go off ter de war. Dey carried 'em off ter de war. I don't know how
many children dey had, but I remember two of 'em goin' off ter de war. Don't know what became
of 'em.

I shore remember de Yankees. Yes sir, Ha! ha! I shore remember dem. Dem Yankees tore down an'
drug out ever'thing, dey come across. Dey killed hogs, an' chickens. Dey took only part of
a hog an' lef' de rest. Dey shot cows, an' sometimes jest cut off de hind quarters an' lef
de rest. Dey knocked de heads out o' de barrels o' molasses. Dey took horses, cows an' eber'thing,
but they did not hurt any o' de children. Dey wus folks dat would tear down things.

Atter de surrender my mother moved over on de plantation where my father stayed. We stayed
dere a long time, an' den we moved back to Richard Seawell's, old master's plantation, stayin'
dere a long time. Den we moved to Jessie Taylor's place below Raleigh between Crabtree Creek
an' Neuse River. When we lef' Taylor's we moved ter Banner Dam northeast of Raleigh near Boone's
Pond. Mother an' father both died dere. Atter leaving dere I come here. I have lived in Oberlin
ebery since. Guess I'll die here; if I can git de money to pay my taxes, I know I will die here.

I think slavery wus good because I wus treated all right. I think I am 'bout as much a slave
now as ever.

I don't think any too much o' Abraham Lincoln, Jeff Davis or any o' dem men. Don't know much
'bout 'em. Guess Mr. Roosevelt is all right. 'Bout half the folks both black an' white is slaves
an' don't know it. When I wus a slave I had nothin' on me, no responsibility on any of us,
only to work. Didn't have no taxes to pay, neber had to think whur de next meal wus comin' from.

Dis country is in a bad fix. Looks like sumptin got to be done someway or people, a lot of
'em, are goin' to parish to death. Times are hard, an' dey is gettin' worse. Don't know how
I am goin' to make it, if I don't git some help. We been prayin' fer rain. Crops are done injured,
but maybe de Lawd will help us. Yes, I trust in de Lawd.

I been married twice. I married Henritta Nunn first, an' den Henritta Jones. I had three children
by first marriage, an' none b [HW: y] second marriage. My wife is over seventy years old. We
have a hard time making enough to git a little sumptin to eat. I wus mighty glad to see you
when you come up dis mornin', an' I hopes what I have told you will help some one to know how
bad we need help. I feels de Lawd will open up de way. Yes sir, I do.

[TR: HW Date "8/31/37"]

MARTHA ADELINE HINTON #2--Star St., Route 2, Raleigh, North Carolina.

I wus born May 3, 1861 at Willis Thompson's plantation in Wake County about fifteen miles from
Raleigh. He wus my marster an' his wife Muriel wus my missus. My father's name wus Jack Emery
an' mother's name was Minerva Emery. My mother belonged to Willis Thompson and my father belonged
to Ephriam Emery. Mother stayed with my marster's married daughter. She married Johnny K. Moore.

Marster had three children, all girls; dere names wus Margaret, Caroline and Nancy. There wus
only one slave house dere 'cause dey only had one slave whur my mother stayed. Marster Thompson
had five slaves on his plantation. He wus good to slaves but his wife wus rough. We had a reasonably
[HW correction] good place to sleep an' fair sumptin to eat. You sees I wus mighty young an'
I members very little 'bout some things in slavery but from what my mother an father tole me
since de war it wus just 'bout middlin' livin' at marster's. Slaves wore homemade clothes an'
shoes. De shoes had wooden bottoms but most slave chilluns went barefooted winter an' summer
till dey wus ole 'nough to go to work. De first pair of shoes I wore my daddy made 'em. I 'member
it well. I will never furgit it, I wus so pleased wid 'em. All slave chillun I knows anything
'bout wore homemade clothes an' went barefooted most of the time an' bareheaded too.

I member de Yankees an' how dey had rods searchin' for money an' took things. I members a Yankee
goin' to mother an' sayin' we was free. When he lef' missus come an' axed her what he say to
her an' mother tole missus what he said an' missus says 'No he didn't tell you you is free,
you jes axed him wus you free.' Father wus hired out to Frank Page of Gary. He wus cuttin cord
wood for him, when he heard de Yankees wus coming he come home. When he got dere de Yankees
had done been to de house an' gone.

Durin' slavery dey tried to sell daddy. De speculator wus dere an 'daddy suspicion sumpin.
His marster tole him to go an' shuck some corn. Dey aimed to git him in de corn crib an' den
tie him an' sell him but when he got to the crib he kept on goin'. He went to Mr. Henry Buffaloe's
an' stayed two weeks den he went back home. Dere wus nuthin' else said 'bout sellin him. Dey
wanted to sell him an buy a 'oman so dey could have a lot of slave chilluns cause de 'oman
could multiply. Dey hired men out by the year to contractors to cut cord wood an' build railroads.
Father wus hired out dat way. Ole man Rome Harp wus hired out day way. He belonged to John Harp.

Daddy said his marster never did hit him but one blow. Daddy said he wurked hard everyday,
an' done as near right as he knowed how to do in everything. His marster got mad ah' hit him
wid a long switch. Den daddy tole him he wus workin' bes' he could for him an' dat he wus not
goin' to take a whuppin. His marster walked off an' dat wus de last of it, an' he never tried
to whup him again. I ain't able to work, ain't been able to do any work in five years. My wife,
Mary Hinton, supports me by workin' with the WPA. She was cut off las' May. Since she has had
no job, we have to live on what she makes with what little washin' she gets from de white folks;
an' a little help from charity; dis ain't much. Dey give you for one week, one half peck meal,
one pound meat, one pound powdered milk, one half pound o' coffee. Dis is what we git for one week.

I wus borned in 1856 on de Fayetteville Road three miles from Raleigh, south. I belonged to
Lawrence Hinton. My missus wus named Jane Hinton. De Hintons had 'bout twenty slaves on de
plantation out dere. Dey had four chillun, de boy Ransom an' three girls: Belle, Annie an'
Miss Mary. All are dead but one, Miss Mary is livin' yit. My mother wus named Liza Hinton an'
my father wus named Bob Hinton. My gran'mother wus named Mary Hinton an' gran'father Harry Hinton.

We had common food in slavery time, but it wus well fixed up, an' we were well clothed. We
had a good place to sleep, yes sir, a good place to sleep. We worked from sunrise to sunset
under overseers. Dey were good to us. I wus small at dat time. I picked up sticks in de yard
an' done some work around de house, but when dey turned deir backs I would be playin' most
o' de time. We played shootin' marbles, an' runnin', an' jumpin'. We called de big house de
dwelling house an' de slave quarters de slave houses. Some of 'em were in marster's yard and
some were outside. Dey give all de families patches and gardens, but dey did not sell anything.

We had prayer meetin' in our houses when we got ready, but dere were no churches for niggers
on de plantation. We had dances and other socials durin' Christmas times. Dey give us de Christmas
holidays.

No sir, dey did not whup me. I wus mighty young. Dey didn't work chillun much. I have seen
'em whup de grown ones do'. I never saw a slave sold and never saw any in chains. Dey run away
from our plantation but dey come back again. William Brickell, Sidney Cook, Willis Hinton all
run away. I don't know why dey all run away but some run away to keep from being whupped.

I have lived in North Carolina all my life, right here in Wake County. We used to set gums
and catch rabbits, set traps and caught patridges and doves.

Yes sir, I went blindin'. I 'members gittin' a big light an' jumpin' 'round de bresh heaps,
an' when a bird come out we frailed him down. We went gigging fish too. We found 'em lying
on de bottom o' de creeks an' ponds at night, an' stuck de gig in 'em an' pulled 'em out.

De white folks, ole missus, teached us de catechism, but dey didn't want you to learn to read
and write. I can read and write now; learned since de surrender. Sometimes we went to de white
folks church. I don't know any songs.

When we got sick our boss man sent for a doctor, Dr. Burke Haywood, Dr. Johnson, or Dr. Hill.

I 'members when de North folks and de Southern folks wus fightin'. De Northern soldiers come
in here on de Fayetteville Road. I saw 'em by de hundreds. Dey had colored folks soldiers in
blue clothes too. In de mornin' white soldiers, in de evenin' colored soldiers; dats de way
dey come to town.

I married first Almeta Harris. I had six children by her. Second, I married Mary Jones. She
is my wife now. We had six children. My wife is now 65 years old and she has to support me.
I am done give out too much to work any more.

Yes sir, that I have seen de patterollers, but my old boss didn't 'low 'em to whup his niggers.
Marster give his men passes.

I know when de Ku Klux was here, but I don't know much about 'em.

I thought slavery wus a bad thing' cause all slaves did not fare alike. It wus all right for
some, but bad for some, so it wus a bad thing.

I joined the church because I got religion and thought the church might help me keep it.

I think Abraham Lincoln wus a good man, but I likes Mr. Roosevelt; he is a good man, a good
man. August 28th. I 'members seeing de Yankees, it seems like a dream. One come along ridin'
a mule. Dey sed he wus a Yankee bummer, a man dat went out raging on peoples things. He found
out whur the things wus located an' carried the rest there. The bummers stole for de army,
chickens, hogs, an' anything they could take. Atter de bummer come along in a few minutes de
whole place wus crowded wid Yankees. De blue coats wus everywhere I could look.

Marster didn't have but five slaves, an' when de Yankees come dere wus only me an' my oldest
sister dere. All de white folks had left except missus and her chillun. Her baby wus only three
weeks ole then.

A Yankee come to my oldest sister an' said, 'Whur is dem horses?' He pulled out a large pistol
an' sed, 'Tell me whur dem horses is or I will take your damn sweet life.' Marster hid de horses
an' sister didn't know, she stuck to it she didn't know an' de Yankees didn't shoot.

Dey come back, de whole crowd, de next day an' made marster bring in his horses. Bey took de
horses an' bought some chickens an' paid for 'em, den dey killed an' took de rest. Ha! ha!
dey shore done dat. Paid for some an' took de rest.

I seed de Yankees atter de surrender. Dey wus staying at de ole Soldiers Home on New Bern Avenue.
One day mother carried me there to sell to 'em. One time she went there an' she had a rooster
who wus a game. His eyes wus out from fighting another game rooster belonging to another person
near our home, Mr. Emory Sewell. She carried de rooster in where dere wus a sick Yankee. De
Yankee took him in his hands an' de rooster crowed. He give mother thirty-five cents for him.
De Yankee said if he could crow an' his eyes out he wanted him. He said, he called dat spunk.

Dere wus a man who wus a slave dat belonged to Mr. Kerney Upchurch come along riding a mule.
My oldest sister, de one de Yankees threatened, tole him de Yankees are up yonder. He said,
'Dad lim de Yankees.' He went on, when he got near de Yankees dey tole him to halt.' Instead
of haltin' he sold out runnin' the mule fur de ole field. Der wus a gang of young fox hounds
dere. When he lit out on de mule, dey thought he wus goin' huntin' so dey took out atter him,
jest like dey wus atter a fox. Some of de Yankees shot at him, de others just almost died a
laughin'.

We didn't git much to eat. Mother said it wus missus fault, she was so stingy.

We had homemade clothes an' wooden bottom shoes for de grown folks, but chillun did not wear
shoes den, dey went barefooted.

All de slaves lived in one house built about one hundred yards from the great house, marsters
house wus called the great house.

My father wus named Robin Hinton an' my mother wus named Dafney Hinton. My father belonged
to Betsy Ransom Hinton an' mother belonged first to Reddin Cromb in Lenoir County an' then
to James Thompson of Wake County. I wus borned after mother wus brought to Wake County. Marster
had one boy named Beuregard, four girls, Caroline, Alice, Lena and Nellie. I do not remember
my grandparents.

I saw a slave named Lucinda, sold to ole man Askew, a speculator, by Kerney Upchurch. I seed
'em carry her off.

One of de slave men who belonged to ole man Burl Temples wus sent to wurk for Mr. Temples'
son who had married. His missus put him to totin' water before goin' to wurk in de mornin'.
Three other slaves toted water also. He refused to tote water an' ran. She set de blood hounds
atter him an' caught him near his home, which wus his ole marster's house. Ole marster's son
come out, an' wouldn't let 'em whup him, an' they wouldn't make him go back.

Missus Harriet Temples wus a terrible 'oman, a slave jest couldn't suit her. De slave dat run
away from young marster wus finally sent back. His marster give him a shoulder of meat before
he left. He hung it in a tree. Missus tole him to put it in the smoke house. He refused, sayin'
he would see it no more.

A slave by the name of Sallie Temples run away 'cause her missus, Mary Temples, wus so mean
to her. She stuck hot irons to her. Made 'em drink milk an' things for punishment is what my
mother an' father said. Sallie never did come back. Nobody never did know what become of her.

Soon as de war wus over father an' mother left dere marsters. Dey went to Mr. Tom Bridgers.
We lived on de farm atter dis. Mother cooked, sister an' I worked on de farm. Sister plowed
like a man. De first help my mammy got wus from de Yankees, it wus pickle meat an' hardtack.
I wus wid her an' dey took me in an' give me some clothes. Mother drawed from 'em a long time.
We have farmed most our lives. Sometimes we worked as hirelings and den as share croppers.
I think slavery wus a bad thing.

I doan know when I wus borned, ner where but at fust my mammy an' me 'longed ter a McGee here
in Wake County. My mammy wurked in de fiel's den, ditchin' an' such, even plowin' while we
'longed ter McGee, but he sold us ter Mr. Rufus Jones. My daddy still 'longed ter him but at
de close of de war he comed ter Mr. Jones' plantation an' he tuck de name of Jones 'long wid us.

Marse Rufus wus gooder dan Marse McGee, dey said. He give us more ter eat an' wear an' he ain't
make us wurk so hard nother. We had our wurk ter do, of course, but mammy ain't had ter ditch
ner plow no mo'. She wurked in de house den, an' none of de wimmen done men's wurk. Course
she can't wurk so hard an' have 'leben chilluns too. She had a baby one day an' went ter wurk
de nex' while she 'longed ter McGee, but at Marse Rufus' she stayed in de bed seberal days
an' had a doctor.

Marse Rufus uster let us take Sadday evenin' off an' go swimmin' er fishin' er go ter Raleigh.
I 'members dat somebody in town had a fuss wid Marse Rufus 'bout lettin' his niggers run loose
in town. Marse Rufus atter dat had a oberseer in town ter see 'bout his niggers.

I got a whuppin' once fer punchin' out a frog's eyes. Miss Sally giv' hit ter me long wid a
lecture 'bout bein' kin' ter dumb brutes, but I ain't neber seed whar a frog am a brute yit.

Yes'um I heard a heap 'bout de Yankees but I ain't prepared fer dere takin' eben our bread.
Miss Sally ain't prepared nother an' she tells' em whar ter go, den she goes ter bed sick.
I wus sorry fer Miss Sally, dat I wus.

De day dat news of de surrender come Miss Sally cried some more an' she ain't wanted mammy
ter go, so Marse Rufus said dat we can stay on. Dey said dat Mister McGee runned his niggers
offen his place wid a bresh broom dat day.

Atter de war we stayed on Marse Rufus' place till 1898 when pa died. I had married a feller
by de name of Charlie Hodges, what lived on a nearby plantation an' we wus livin' on Marse
Rufus' place wid pa an' ma. We moved ter Raleigh den an' atter seberal years mammy moved hear
too. You can fin' her on Cannon Street, but I'll tell you dat she's pretty puny now, since
her stroke. My father and mother belonged to Mr. L. B. Huggins. My father was a carpenter and
ship builder an' the first things I remember was down on Myrtle Grove Sound, where Mr. Huggins
had a place. I was a sort of bad boy an' liked to roam 'round. When I was about twelve years
old I ran away. It was in 1863 when the war was goin' on.

Nobody was bein' mean to me. No, I was'nt bein' whipped. Don't you know all that story 'bout
slaves bein' whipped is all Bunk, (with scornful emphasis). What pusson with any sense is goin'
to take his horse or his cow an' beat it up. It's prope'ty. We was prope'ty. Val'able prope'ty.
No, indeed, Mr. Luke give the bes' of attention to his colored people, an' Mis' Huggins was
like a mother to my mother. Twa'nt anythin' wrong about home that made me run away. I'd heard
so much talk 'bout freedom I reckon I jus' wanted to try it, an' I thought I had to get away
from home to have it.

Well, I coaxed two other boys to go with me, an' a grown man he got the boat an' we slipped
off to the beach an' put out to sea. Yes'm, we sho' was after adventure. But, we did'n get
very far out from sho', an' I saw the lan' get dimmer an' dimmer, when I got skeered, an' then
I got seasick, an' we was havin' more kinds of adventure than we wanted, an' then we saw some
ships. There was two of 'em, an' they took us on board.

They was the North Star an' the Eastern Star of the Aspinwal Line, a mail an' freighter runnin'
between Aspinwal near the Isthmus of Panama and New York. We used to put in off Charleston.

Then, in 1864 I joined the Union Navy. Went on board our convoy, the Nereus. We convoyed to
keep the Alabama, a Confederate privateer, away. The Commander of the Nereus asked me how's
I like to be his cabin boy. So I was 2nd class cabin boy an' waited on the Captain. He was
Five Stripe Commander J. C. Howell. He was Commander of the whole fleet off Fort Fisher. When
the Captain wanted somethin' good to eat he used to send me ashore for provisions. He liked
me. He was an old man. He didn't take much stock in fun, but he was a real man. I was young
an' was'nt serious. I jus' wanted a good time. I don't know much about the war, but I do know
two men of our boat was killed on shore while we was at Fort Fisher.

After the battle of Fort Fisher, we was on our way to Aspinwal. Layin' off one day at Navassa
Island, the Mast Head reported a strange sail. 'Where away?' 'Just ahead'. 'She seems to be
a three mast steamer!' 'Which way headed?' We decided it was the Alabama going to St. Nicholas
Mole, West Indies.

Our Captain called the officers together an' held a meetin'. Says he: 'We'll go under one bell
(slow). Lieutenant will go ashore an' get some information.' When we got there she had a coal
schooner alongside taking on coal. Our Captain prepared to capture her when she came out. But
she did'n come out 'til night. She dodged. Good thing too. She'd a knocked hells pete out o'
us. She was close to the water and could have fought us so much better than we could her. We
didn't want to fight 'cause we knowed enough to jest natu'ally be skeered. She was a one decker
man o' war. We was a two decker with six guns on berth deck, an' five guns on spar deck. I
never saw her after that, but I heard she was contacted by the Kearsage which sunk her off
some island.

I stayed in the navy eighteen months. Was discharged at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Admiral Porter
was Admiral of the U. S. Navy at that time.

I stayed in New York five or six years, then I cane home to my mother. I was in the crude drug
business in Wilmington for twenty years.

Yes'm I went to church and Sunday school when I was a child, when they could ketch me. Whilst
I was in New York I went to church regular.

I married after awhile. My wife died about ten years ago. We had one son. I b'lieve he's in
Baltimore, but I ain't heard from him in a long time. He don't keer nothin' about me. Of co'se
I'm comfortable. I gits my pension, $75 a month. I give $10 of it to my nephew who's a cripple.
I wus borned an' reared in Wake County, N. C., born May, 1857. My mother wus Rosa Hunter an'
my father wus named Jones. I never saw my father. We belonged to a family named Jones first,
an' then we wus sold to a slave owner seven miles Northwest by the name Joe Hayes an' a terrible
man he wus. He would get mad 'bout most anything, take my mother, chain her down to a log and
whup her unmercifully while I, a little boy, could do nothing but stan' there an' cry, an'
see her whupped. We had fairly good food an' common clothing. We had good sleeping places.
My mother wus sold to a man named Smith. I married first Annie Hayes who lived sixteen months.

No prayer meetings wus allowed on de plantations an' no books of any kind. I can read an' write,
learned in a school taught by Northern folks after the surrender, Mr. an' Mrs. Graves who taught
in Raleigh in the rear of the African Methodist Episcopal church. The school house wus owned
by the church. We played no games in slavery times. I saw slaves sold on the block once in Raleigh.

I wus to be sold but the surrender stopped it. When the Yankees come they asked me where wus
my marster. I told them I didn't know. Marster told me not to tell where he wus. He had gone
off into the woods to hide his silver. In a few minutes the ground wus covered with Yankees.
The Yankees stole my pen knife. I thought a lot of it. Knives wus scarce and hard to get. I
cried about they taking it. They got my marster's carriage horses, two fine gray horses. His
wife had lost a brother, who had been in the army but died at home. He wus buried in the yard.
The Yankees thought the grave wus a place where valuables wus buried and they had to get a
guard to keep them from diggin' him up. They would shoot hogs, cut the hams and shoulders off,
stick them on their bayonetts, throw them over the'r shoulders an' go on.

We called our houses shanties in slavery time. I never saw any patterollers. I don't remember
how many slaves on the plantation wus taken to Richmond an' sold. My mother looked after us
when we wus sick. I had four brothers an' no sisters. They are all dead. I did house work an'
errands in slavery time. I have seen one gang of Ku Klux. They wus under arrest at Raleigh
in Governor Holden's time. I don't remember the overseer.

We moved to Raleigh at the surrender. Marster give us a old mule when we left him, an' I rode
him into Raleigh. We rented a house on Wilmington Street, an' lived on hard tack the Yankees
give us 'til we could git work.

Mother went to cooking for the white folks, but I worked for Mr. Jeff Fisher. I held a job
thirty-five years driving a laundry truck for L. R. Wyatt. The laundry wus on the corner of
Jones an' Salisbury Street.

I married Cenoro Freeman. We lived together fifty-six years. She wus a good devoted wife. We
wus married Dec. 9, 1878. She died in May 1934. [HW: bracket] Booker T. Washington wus a good
man. I have seen him. Abraham Lincoln wus one of my best friends. He set me free. The Lawd
is my best friend. I don't know much 'bout Jefferson Davis. Jim Young an' myself wus pals.

My object in joining the church wus to help myself an' others to live a decent life, a life
for good to humanity an' for God.

I wuz borned eight miles from Raleigh on de plantation of Mr. Jacob Hunter in 1844. My parents
were Stroud and Lucy an' my brothers wuz Tom, Jeems an' Henderson. I had three sisters who
wuz named Caroline, Emiline an' Ann.

Massa Hunter wuz good to us, an' young Massa Knox wuz good too. My mammy wuz de cook an' my
pappy wuz a field hand. Massa ain't 'lowed no patterollers on his place, but one time when
he wuzn't ter home my mammy sent me an' Caroline ter de nex' door house fer something an' de
patterollers got us. Dey carried us home an' 'bout de time dat dey wuz axin' questions young
Massa Knox rid up.

He look dem over an' he sez, 'Git off dese premises dis minute, yo' dad-limb sorry rascals,
if us needs yo' we'll call yo'. 'My pappy patterolls dis place hisself.'

Dey left den, an' we ain't been bothered wid 'em no more.

I toted water 'fore de war, minded de sheeps, cows and de geese; an' I ain't had many whuppin's
neither. Dar wuz one thing dat massa ain't 'low an' dat wuz drinkin' 'mong his niggers.

Dar wuz a ole free issue named Denson who digged ditches fer massa an' he always brung long
his demijohn wid his whiskey. One ebenin' Missus tells me an' Caroline ter go ter de low groun's
an' git up de cows an' on de way we fin' ole man Denson's demijohn half full of whiskey. Caroline
sez ter lets take er drink an' so we does, an' terreckly I gits wobbly in de knees.

Dis keeps on till I has ter lay down an' when I wakes up I am at home. Dey says dat Massa Jacob
totes me, an' dat he fusses wid Denson fer leavin' de whiskey whar I can fin' it. He give me
a talkin' to, an' I ain't neber drunk no more.

When we hyard dat de Yankees wuz comin' ole massa an' me takes de cattle an' hosses way down
in de swamp an' we stays dar wid dem fer seberal days. One day I comes ter de house an' dar
dey am, shootin' chickens an' pigs an' everthing. I'se seed dem cut de hams off'n a live pig
or ox an' go off leavin' de animal groanin'. De massa had 'em kilt den, but it wuz awful.

Dat night dey went away but de nex' day a bigger drove come an' my mammy cooked fer 'em all
day long. Dey killed an' stold ever'thing, an' at last ole massa went to Raleigh an' axed fer
a gyard. Atter we got de gyard de fuss ceased. One of de officers what spent de night dar lost
his pocket book an' in it wuz seven greenback dollars, de fust I eber seed.

We wuz glad ter be free even do' we had good white folks. De wuck hours wuz frum daybreak till
dark, an' de wimmens had ter card an' spin so much eber night. We had our own chickens an'
gyarden an' little ways of makin' money, but not so much fun.

We played cat, which wuz like base ball now, only different. De children played a heap but
de grown folks wucked hard. De cruelest thing I eber seed wuz in Raleigh atter slavery time,
an' dat wuz a nigger whuppin'.

De pillory wuz whar de co'rthouse am now an' de sheriff, Mr. Ray whupped dat nigger till he bled.

I neber seed a slave sale, an' I neber seed much whuppin's. I larned some long wid de white
chilluns, 'specially how ter spell.

No mam, I doan know nothin' 'bout witches, but I seed a ghos'. Hit wuz near hyar, an' hit wuz
a animal as big as a yearlin' wid de look of a dog. I can't tell you de color of it case I
done left frum dar.
